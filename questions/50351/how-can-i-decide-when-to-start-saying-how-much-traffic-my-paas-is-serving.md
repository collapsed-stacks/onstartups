I'm working on improving the way we communicate how large/stable our PaaS is.  One idea is that we could say "we serve X web requests a day on behalf of our customers".  I have the number for that, and it feels high to me.  But I don't know whether it's high enough -- perhaps potential customers would think that it's low and be put off.

What would be the best way to find out the minimum number of hits/day that would seem like a positive signal for potential customers?

[EDIT] This would, of course, be in addition to other kinds of messaging along the same lines (like the social proof suggested by jimg below).  The reason I think something showing our scale would be useful is that some people have unsubscribed because they didn't know that we'd be able to handle the amount of traffic they were expecting.  In cases where we discovered that this had happened, we were able to get them back, but I worry that we've lost other people in similar circumstances without knowing about it.

Large is somewhat subjective & doesn't necessarily convey stability.

I would consider the social proof route: Testimonials from companies that trust your service would likely go further than "speeds and feeds" statistics.
