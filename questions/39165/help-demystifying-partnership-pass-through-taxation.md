##Situation##
I am in the process of deciding which type of taxation to choose for my LLC. Up until this point I was leaning towards Partnership taxation because that is what LLC For Dummies was recommending, but my brain is still having issues connecting the dots. I have found the following answer http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/11109/simple-overview-of-llc-pass-through-taxation useful but let's see if I manage to articulate my question(s).

##Facts##

 1. One of the advantages of an LLC is **no double taxation -** via pass-through taxation profits are not taxed at the company level, only at the individual level.
 2. With partnership taxation, the business's profits and losses get passed on to the owners, who report their share on personal tax returns. These profits and losses are called **allocations**
 3. When the company does not **distribute** profits to the members, the profit is called **phantom income**, and the members still have to pay taxes on it out their own pockets.

##Questions##

For the questions below, let's pretend that

 - The LLC has partnership structure with my 2 daughters and myself as members.
 
 - Each one of my daughters has 1% ownership, myself 98% ownership.

 - I am the manager of the company.

 - I make a profit of $10,000 say for example in my first 3 months 

Questions as follows:

 1. Would the $10,000 be considered an **allocation**, and hence I would only have to pay taxes **once** during my personal income tax returns?
 2. Would my daughters being underage (way underage like 2 & 3) have to submit personal income tax return at the end of the year since they had a 1% allocation?
 3. Where do allocations go? to my personal bank account? or to the business bank account? If they go directly to my personal bank account then its mine and I can take the $ out and spend it whatever i want, but if it goes to my business bank account, can I take it out and spend it for my personal use?
 4. If I was to pay myself a salary (because I am a manager) that is a distribution, then I would have to pay taxes on that salary is that right? That means I get taxed double. Is this a correct statement? If so I do not see the **no double taxation advantage**
     
 5. What happens if I have an employee? Do I have to pay taxes 3 times? Once for ownership (profits-losses) included in my personal tax returns, twice for my own distribution (salary), and third for payroll?

I hope you are able to internalize my confusion. If the assumptions in my questions are correct then I am not sure what my billable rate will have to be in order to make the same money (or more) that I make out of my full-time job. Seems like in order to be able to provide benefits for yourself and pay and employee with benefits you need to be rolling in a pretty good chunk of money. Just to throw a number out there it feels that I have to charge $150 per hour...not exactly sure if that is pretty feasible.

I guess my final question will be:

 1. Is there a way to be taxed **once and only once**?


Thanks.

First and foremost, you need to talk to a (real) tax advisor.

Having said that, and putting a disclaimer that this answer was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer (circ. 230, as I am a tax practicioner), lets go over your questions:

> Would the $10,000 be considered an allocation, and hence I would only

Yes.

> had a 1% allocation?

Percentage doesn't matter, amounts matter. Depending on the amounts of the allocated earnings, they might be required to submit personal tax returns.

For better accountability and records-keeping, all your business income and expenses should go through your business account. You can take distributions from the business account, make sure to record them in your books accordingly. Mangling business and personal expenses in the same account may lead to piercing the limited liability.

No, it is not a correct statement. Whether you pay yourself a salary, or get a business income, the taxes are the same (if its earned income), just paid differently (SE taxes instead of salary withholding and payroll taxes). You can extend your portion of income in excess to the allocated income by paying yourself a salary.

> What happens if I have an employee? Do I have to pay taxes 3 times?
> Once for ownership (profits-losses) included in my personal tax

You have to pay payroll taxes, for each employee. It is your business expense. You don't pay the tax on the money you paid someone else on your tax returns, they should be paying on theirs. Why would you pay someone else's taxes?

> Is there a way to be taxed once and only once?

Not sure I understand why would you think that you're taxed more than once. Unless you're treating your LLC as a C-Corporation, you will **always** be taxed only once.

Get a tax advisor to help you, that's what professionals are there for.

> Would the $10,000 be considered an allocation, and hence I would only have to pay taxes once during my personal income tax returns?

Yes, it is considered an allocation, since it is derived from company profits. The amount from that which goes to you and your daughters individually is considered a distribution or distributive share, and the distributive share is what is taxed.

> Would my daughters being underage (way underage like 2 & 3) have to submit personal income tax return at the end of the year since they had a 1% allocation?

Not if they are only receiving $100 each (1%). They have to file if:

-The child has unearned income (from investment interest, gains, and so on) above $950.

-The child has earned income above $5,800.

-Gross income is greater than the larger of $950 or earned income (up to $5,800) plus $300.

-Net earnings from self-employment are $400 or more.

(These amounts might change over time, so please check the IRS for updated rules. Also, if a child earns more than $1900 in interest income, they may be taxed partially at the parents' tax rate: http://www.irs.gov/publications/p929/index.html).

They should go to the business bank account to establish a clean paper trail for the IRS and protect your personal assets from liability. Since your business is family-owned and you are the 98% interest-holder, you have authority over company expenses... **However**, the actual purpose of the expense affects whether you can write off the expense when calculating your company's net profit.

If you pay yourself salary for management duty, it is considered a **guaranteed payment**. There is no double tax. You treat the guaranteed payment it as income on your personal income tax statement.
Be VERY careful, however, about predicating that salary on the LLC's income. See below: http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/30062
