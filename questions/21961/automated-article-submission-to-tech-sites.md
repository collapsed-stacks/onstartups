I'm looking to start increasing exposure to my website and I am looking to do so thru a series of small but quality articles that I plan to be publishing on a "few times per week" basis.

There are a number of technical sites (.NET development related) out there that would publish my articles if I were to submit the articles to them via a manual submision process.

Is there a way to automate the process?  Are there services that specialize in this?  I'm not looking to spam/scam/etc.  I'd like to configure such service to which sites I want my articles to be submitted to.

I used many automated softwares for submission, but never got good results. I think it is better if you can do it manually. No need to submit to a 100 directories, just choose top 20 ones.

I'm Taylor Vogt, the Operations Director at Content Crooner. Our CEO, Ken Vogt, is my father (hence the name). An automated distribution service could be the solution you're looking for.

Pros:

-It's faster and easier than manual submissions. You'll submit each post once and the automated system does the rest for you, including creating author profiles at directories.

-More exposure (meaning more backlinks). Your content will go everywhere on the distribution list that accepts content in your category, much more than you'd be able to do by hand.

-Customer service and help in creating better quality content. Most distribution services will have a human review your content with the intention of helping it be useful to readers. You'll be able to find loads of information on content marketing and be able to converse with trained specialists through customer service. The educational benefits can pay for themselves.

Cons:

-Monthly fees and/or subscriptions. Depending on what you're looking for, this may or not be for you. Granted, you certainly get what you pay for.

-Control over where your content goes. It's unlikely you'll find a distribution service that gives you complete control over where your content is sent. More often that not, your content goes to all sites accepting your specific categories of content. You won't get to pick to choose.

This info should generally apply to most automated distribution services. I don't specifically know any exceptions. Let me know if you have any other questions. :)
