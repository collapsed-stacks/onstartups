As the owner of a business with a Facebook "place" page I wanted to know if I could sell status/post updates to my fans to various suppliers of goods and services in the area? 

Having started a community page and a community organisation I have been getting lots of requests from businesses in the area asking me to send messages to my fans on their behalf. I'm sure the fans would be interested in a lot of these messages and I've done a lot for free now I would like to add that to our organisation's services. 

After reading the TOS I'm confused, as the messages are not being sent through my personal profile I don't think I'm in violation of anything using my business page in this way but I'm not sure. Any help or advice would be appreciated on the matter. Thanks.

Usually when there is doubt about whether this or similar would be ok its best avoided.

Facebook, google and the other biggies usually dont take too kindly to people selling what in a sense is what they have patented, its like selling something that truely isn't yours to sell.

An example would be the whole pagerank thing of google, over the years people have got up to allsorts of tricks based around pagerank including sellings links because they were offered from high pr pages.

Although people are asking you for this, its probably less risk for them than it is for you.

Im saying no because i cant see facebook saying yes to this.

What you want really falls in a grey area which might be okay on a small scale but if it were to go massive, then you likely would encounter issues.

A similar situation actually came up a year or so ago on Twitter when companies started paying users for the ability to Tweet ads under their accounts. Although the concept was controversial, Twitter did allow it because it didn't compete against their model (which at the time was nothing).

Now that Twitter has their own ad systems, I'm sure the game has changed, but all in all, for a small business getting a small amount for a status mentioning them, that seems to be permissible since there isn't really any way for Facebook to stop you.

It's kinda like me getting $50 to post a status mentioning a brand. Practically Facebook can't stop me because that would be like censoring speech.
