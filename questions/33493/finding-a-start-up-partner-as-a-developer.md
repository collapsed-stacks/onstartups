I have been coding solutions since like the dawn of time, at least that's how it feels, and I love it so now I want to help found a new start up or help an existing start up that needs a technical director or CTO. 

I have the entrepreneurial spirit and I have the technical skills but I can't seem to locate any place on the web to hook up my skill sets with a business idea. Granted I just started looking but I was wondering if there was a brokering site that listed potential ideas or start up companies that I could peruse to see if there would be a fit. If I can't find one then maybe I should build it?

<p>I would also suggest looking offline.  Use any existing networks you have (current colleagues, friends and family).  You might be surprised how many people you know are also interesting in founding a startup.  Plus search online for any local entrepreneur meetups.   </p>

<p>Also try going to a <a href="http://startupweekend.org/" rel="nofollow">Startup Weekend</a> if there is one nearby to you.  You'll get to meet loads of great people (developers, designers, business people and experienced entrepreneurs) and get a chance to see what it's actually like to work with them.</p>

Try focusing on what you want to do and what your role would be in a startup first, and let that guide your path. Are you an idea person full of great ideas? Start coding on one while you look for a partner. Are you a technological genius that just loves thrill of building something great? Find a startup that is just a couple guys and is in the idea stage. 

Whatever the case try participating in groups on LinkedIn. Make yourself visible while seeking out opportunities and potential partners that share your vision.

The problem here is, from a technical perspective, it's very rare than technical folks who are startup-oriented and generally so because they're created something useful and want to get it out there. They're not interested in your idea and will be looking for a business person who'll go along with their idea. i.e. people come to this position mostly with their idea for the first time.

I'd suggest looking at which startups have executed their exit strategy within the past 0-6 months and see whether the engineers in there are looking to exit at some point. If I get to exit on my current attempt, I can imagine I'd be happy to have go as not the key founder next time, but a member of a core 4-5 team working on someone else's idea.

Some great sites for finding cofounders are: Cofounderslab.com and FounderDating.com...A friend of mine found her technical cofounder on the latter. The former holds networking events in partner cities where entrepreneurs can mix and mingle.

Another resource is matchist.com. It's a site that connects top freelance developers and dev shops with entrepreneurs that want to build MVPs, software, mobile apps, etc...There's no equity involved but often for those entrepreneurs who spend a lot of time trying to find a technical person, having a freelance developer build an MVP to prove out the initial concept can be a better use of time/resources.
