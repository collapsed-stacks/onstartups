## Started with a simple website - got a few users - what's next?

I created a little website called BabyNotify.com which initially was built only for ourselves. My wife convinced me to create a "public" version. After we released it we got some press from different websites and also a few "real" users. 

I am not running any ads yet, but I have some ideas how to implement offers from companies. I don't want to spam it and want to keep it as simple as it is now. 

My questions are:

1) Of course I think it's the best tool in the world - but how can I increase my traffic and convince more people to use it? I have a Twitter, Facebook, etc - posted the link everywhere - anyone know the magic how to spread the word?
2) How do I approach big companies (like Pampers or Similac) to advertise on my internet tool. How do you deal with big corporations? 
3) Baby-R-Us has a online registry - I want to approach them and offer them to include BabyNotify in their service and create a special version for it that integrates in their existing system. But how can I do that? Do I need to know somebody high-up or do I have a chance when I just approach them myself?
4) What if I want to make the big bucks with it - where do I start with Investors - is it too early? 

Tell me also what you think about my internet tool :-)

Thanks,

Andy

<p>First of all - Great concept and site!</p>

<p>I have split my answer into two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to increase traffic</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two things that you should focus on. One is organic search engine traffic. Make a list of the keywords people will use to find your site (Use <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&amp;__c=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none" rel="nofollow">Google Keyword Tool</a> to help). Make sure that your on page SEO is adjusted to those keywords you have targeted. Then create a blog (Wordpress is a good candidate) and start talking about your industry, this will help immensely with your SEO and also make you an "expert" in your field which will also help you monetize. The second part is to attract direct traffic from other sites. Make a list of the most popular blogs and forums which discuss your industry and are related to your keywords. Start posting interesting and relevent comments. After you start getting noticed, ask bloggers to review your site or offer to create a guest post (I am sure a good amount of traffic you have enjoyed so far has come from other blogs etc.).</p>

<ol>
<li>How to monetize</li>
</ol>

<p>You have a few options here. The most common is Google Adsense (difficult to make serious $$). However I would consider the following three options: 1. Charge a fee for your service, 2. Become an affiliate marketer (Create an e-mail list of readers when visitors subscribe, then send them information of new products containing links to the respective e-commerce sites. If users make a purchase using your link then you will be paid a commission usually between 10-50%), or 3. Approach companies to advertise on your site. To do this one you will need to prove that you are generating alot of traffic and also that you have 'authority' or respect in your given field.</p>

<p>You may want to check out "<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0061914177" rel="nofollow">Crush it</a>" by Gary Vaynerchuck. The book contains a bit of fluff and self promotion, but there is also alot of great info about creating an audience/community in a niche, and then monetizing from this.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

Good work.  Going forward add modules to connect to baby gifts stores such as Toy Stores eg:www.toysrus.com and greetings website such as www.greetings.com etc to enable friends & family to buy & send gifts to the new born. 

Good Luck

Unless you convince there is a good revenue model associated with your website and have significant number of registered users; it would be difficult to raise any money.  Check http://www.tinyprints.com/ they have Birth Announcements, Shop & Custom Photo Cards.

Goodluck

Standard advertising won't make enough money to bother with.  Even sites with *millions* of unique hits/month have given up on the likes of AdWords.

You have a targeted community, so focus on who wants to reach those particular people really badly. Baby stuff is obvious. Consider how formula companies will give away expensive tote bags at pediatrician's offices because they want your business for a year -- those are the kinds of companies who are *already* spending lots of money to reach the people you have, so those are the people you want to partner with.

Note that "partner" could mean ads, but maybe something stronger like sending them free samples.  Since you can tweet for them, maybe if they tweet that they're *just trying* Simulac means they get some free Simulac.

In other words, think outside just "ads" and into what you can do with the power you have.

One limitation with advertising is individals are only going to go to your site 2-3 times. Granted there is a large market of expecting parents, but you need something to get them coming back. 

You can keep you birth arrival notification free and charge for an online baby album. Birthday notifications and parties can be spread. Have a database to enter milestones like growth rates (height and weight), crawling, first step, first word and allow for commentary, photos and video. Other social sites don't allow this type of archival capability. 

Not only do you get moms and dads looking at the site, but other freiends and family members as well. 

You may want to crawl before you run on getting advertising. Work on parents in your local area. Then you can get a local boutique baby shop or party store to offer a coupon that you include in the notice.
