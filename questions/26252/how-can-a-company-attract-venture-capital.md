What are some ways that a company can attract investors?  I am the proud owner of a profitable software as a service (SaaS) company and I need capital to grow.  But this is more of a broad question.  What are some creative ways to raise capital and attract investors to a fledgling company?

You say that you are profitable, so how profitable is your company and why can't you channel the profits to develop and market your product further?

If you are planning to travel on a rocket ship then you definitely need VCs. But, always realize first hand where you are headed to. Because VCs money is huge and there are tons of chances that you will fuel bad ideas and un-researched verticals.

Now, how to get ready to attract investors.

1. Prepare an impressive slide deck following the 10-20-30 rule of Guy Kawasaki.
2. Your business plan should consist of 3/6/9 months projections on marketing spend and income generated.
3. VCs, on an apprehension ask for long term projections, such as 3 or 5 year plan. Prepare a rough picture based on current stats increasing the market revenue by 4-7%.
4. Get Guy Kawasaki's "Enchantment" and learn every trick of the trade on how to enchant VCs or angels and most importantly customers.

Start up capital you seek maybe just seed capital...look for angels. VC money is good for scaling a potentially big business or else you will waste a lot of time.

I would start by connecting online and on social networks with the top ten people in your field including competitors, investors, professors, potential acquiesce etc.....keep connecting and eventually capital calls will happen.
