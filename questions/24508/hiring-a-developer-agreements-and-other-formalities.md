I run a software startup based out of India.

To write a module of my application I am talking to a developer. To make things formal I wanted to sign an agreement. 

The agreement should talk about all the things that would give me the ownership of the code after the developer has done developing it. 

I'm not aware of other legalities. Can anyone help me by providing a sample agreement or a draft? 
Thanks

Easiest way is to contact any professional developer and ask the for a proposal. They will give you the estimate including all your requirements for the project. Then have a look at it and create your own by using it as your reference.

<p>Well it is going to be specific for to your area and based on the laws you are working under.</p>

<p>There are a ranage of standard agreements which form good starting points at <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/" rel="nofollow">docstoc</a> or a few other similar sites. You can then get a Lawyer to tweak it to suit your specific requirements.</p>

<p>Key thinkgs you want to cover off though are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interlectual property rights and copyright is transfered from the Author upon payment.</li>
<li>Source code is transfered upon payment.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual, not a lawyer, ask a professional before committing yourself.</p>
