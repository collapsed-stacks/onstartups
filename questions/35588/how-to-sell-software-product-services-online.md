I am based at India and have one developed product which is targeting to Indian market. It can be changed easily to cater western market too.

Along with that we have consulting and project development capabilities to but we didn't get stable and calm clients.

What i mean by calm is as we want to deliver service as part time activity and want to deliver something awesome but as it take time to mature so we want client which can anticipate his need in advance and we will provide him solutions at very cheap rate.

in a way we are looking for long term relationship too.....

any idea how to find someone similar as all freelancing sites have exactly opposite type of developers and clients...

thanks,

You can't really force your clients to be "calm and stable" or only cater to those type of clients. If you do, you won't have a business.

What I suggest is that you lay your cards on the table early on. Put it on your website or let potential clients know when you meet them. That you're still developing your customer support and you'd appreciate it if they could give you their needs early on and to be patient. I think your clients would also appreciate it if you can give them an ETA on your delivery. I find that clients don't mind waiting if they know exactly how long they need to wait.

I hope this helps. Good luck!
