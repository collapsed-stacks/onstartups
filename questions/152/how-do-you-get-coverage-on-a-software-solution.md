We recently launched a Business Operations Intelligence solution, where we've integrated a business operations improvement methodology with an enterprise level BI technology (used for improved cost control and alignment of investments with growth). We've had success in our network of connections, but obviously believe in our product and want to inch away at marketshare.  Obtaining "coverage" and inbound links would help up with awareness and exposure.

How do you get coverage on a software solution (e.g., blog, research group, etc.)?

You're basically asking:
"What is marketing, and how do we do it?"

Well- that's a pretty big question, but...

Blog.

Blog. Blog. Blog. Blog.

Set up a decent, SEO-friendly site with WordPress and get every member of your team to blog once a day, even a paragraph or two, about cool things going on, projects you're working on, related news from the industry you serve. Blogging is the best thing you can do to build SEO.

After you've been doing that for a month or two, and have some depth of content in your site, start making ripples (and waves) by commenting regularly on other blogs. Answer questions that are vaguely related to your product/industry. Contribute to the conversation. Every now and then, plug your site (in a non-crappy way).

Reach out to key bloggers in your industry/field and related (even tangentially) fields. Develop relationships with them by commenting, contributing, and offering value. Guest blog. Invite them to guest blog for you. Interview Thought Leaders an post the video on your site and on YouTube.

Publish a white paper or two (or twelve) that are NOT about your product, but which are related and would be informative and helpful to your potential buyers. GIVE THEM AWAY without requiring any lead-capturing email registration stuff.

Follow industry leaders and potential buyers on Twitter. Engage with them in a useful (non-spammy) way.

If the geography work out, try building a local networking community or running classes on useful things. Present at seminars and conferences. Go networking.


That's pretty much the relationship building / new media / twenty-first century / Social networking / Thought Leadership way to build buzz and sales without traditional advertising.

Oh.

One more thing:

Try not to string pointless buzzwords together quite so much:
"Business Operations Intelligence solution"
"integrated a proven, powerful business operations improvement methodology with an enterprise level BI technology"

I'm sure that means something to you. To everyone else it sounds like:
"Blah blah techno-BS blah blah marketing-crap blah blah give us money blah blah we're smarter than you."

Not appealing.

to start, i'd suggest talking about your product in terms of the customer problem it solves rather than that alphabet soup of buzzwords :-)

One way to find coverage is find similar companies or clients that you already have, and figure out where they "hangout" or how to be visible to them.

Can be via targeted posts on your blog, connect with them on twitter, on facebook, connect with whomever would probably be responsible in deciding the kind of products/services you are offering.

Avoid negative tactics, as that will just reflect on your image. Focus on how you can fill-in a gap, and be visible there.

One benefit of following them on twitter/facebook, is once in a while you'll get an idea of what they think about what they're currently using now and what they think is lacking, and then you can pitch in (you have to be very honest here) how you can fill in that.

To break into the business intelligence market, I'd suggest the following:

Identify:

Top bloggers (on lists like Mashable and Technorati)
Bloggers who cover your industry

Develop:
Your list of followers
Your tweets, topics and comments
Active groups on all the major social networks - immediately
(These things can be outsourced to interns seeking experience "virtual interns")

Develop a class, such as the one offered at Inbound Marketing University, which offers a thorough, free certification for completing about a week or two of study, and the students will be your fans who will generate some traffic to your site.

Last, but not least, actively post to the top blogging sites and to your leading industry bloggers with links to your data, white papers or your class.

Hey Steve, this is off-topic and super in-the-weeds but consider slowing down the transitions between "slides" on your main page.  It kept changing before I could get past the second bullet point.

I did notice the pause button but I feel like that should be there to be used as a last resort, not as required clicking.
