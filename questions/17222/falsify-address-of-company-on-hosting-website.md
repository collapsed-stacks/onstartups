My problem is that we're planning on using Windows Azure hosting, but we're from Jamaica. Windows Azure does not yet allow hosting in Jamaica. Is it okay for a company to falsify an address to get access to what they need? I don't expect any physical contact. We can use an address of one of our friends or relatives in the US. All other data is correct, except the address.

Can we get in any legal trouble for this?

No it is not OK to lie to get access to a service that it is not allowed yet in your country. I suggest you find another hosting company to host your project until Windows Azure is available in your country.

Good luck.

If I were you I would contact some MS folks (maybe an evangelist like Patrick Foley who co-hosts a startup podcast) and ask them what the schedule is for availability - or make other legal arrangements or just pick another technology.  

I would imagine there has to be an acceptable way to front a business in another country that is supported and do it "legally".

Misrepresenting yourself is definitely not the way to go.

If you are even even remotely considering this I would advise against discussing it online publicly with your full name.  

That being said, ethical reasons aside I fail to see why Azure is so special to deserve all the extra effort.

You should definitely start by clarifying this directly with Microsoft. Check what restrictions are in place and what the implications are going to be: it's possible that there are technical as well as commercial reasons. You need to be sure that the route will work, if you can overcome this practical issue.

If you take the case of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, a number of third parties have created intermediate arrangements that allow non-US companies to access the service. This may be possible with Azure - and in that case partnering with a US company (or a company in any territory presently served) is surely a better route than misrepresentation that could bring you a world of trouble in future.

i did that with googlecheckout and it works fine, they generally have so many accounts they never bother to check each one individually anyway

Did you contact Microsoft to ask about how you should purchase Azure if you are located in Jamaica?  Given the platform and the fact that is available for world wide use it is really odd that they would not allow someone to purchase access simply because they live in Jamaica.

Unless there are taxes or legal issues keeping them from doing business in Jamaica.

What if Microsoft comes after you after you went through expense of setting up on the server? Contact them and explain your dilemma. Possibly they'll be willing to work with you.
