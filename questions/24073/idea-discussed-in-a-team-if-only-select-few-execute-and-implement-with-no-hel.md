An idea was recently discussed at work amongst the team, but we realized there was no buy-in from management without a working prototype. Also there was no funding available from the employer to work on this - so the idea was put on the back burner or had to be done as a side project.

If 2 members from this team were to work on their own time, own equipment/licenses after work and build a prototype - can the rest of the team or the employer claim a stake to this application? 

Background: Organization allows people to have side projects as long as they do not interfere/compete against the core business of the organization. This application does not infringe on the business's core area. The idea was not originated by the 2 team members building the prototype but was proposed by the team lead to the entire team in an email to invite interest, comments but ultimately shelved due to lack of funding/buy-in from management.

There is a saying I have heard they use in Russia, "never ask a man how he made his first million".  I say go for it.   Work on it until it becomes "yours" and don't reveal what you are doing to the people who aren't involved.  In six months, the entire situation will look different - the "team" you discussed might have moved on to different things- your thinking about the product might be different. "Time" will likely make your concerns irrelevant.
