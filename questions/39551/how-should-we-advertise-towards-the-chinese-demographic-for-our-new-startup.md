I got tons of chinese visitors. Many have tons of chinese visitors unused. Anything that can convert that will be great.

For months and years I do not know what to do with those traffic.

Now there are other things that are converting too by the way.

The key here is that there are many webmasters with the same problem that I do. Adbucks.com for example, let you select by country. Price of chinese visitors tend to be low.

Just buy traffic there and make sure your product is attractive.

That should be a peace of the puzzle at least.

I think you need to get yourself a partner in China who can help make inroads in the Chinese market. They could also help translate your site into Chinese - important, as many people on the mainland don't know English.

China and India share a common border....  although they are both BIG countries, you might consider visiting China from your home country India?

Plus of course do all of what has been said already:
a) go on the chinese social media sites
b) get somebody who speaks chinese fluently
