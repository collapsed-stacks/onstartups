I have a question about frequency of use of Credit Cards
in international selling process. 

From your selling experience, which credit cards are most used 
in your International selling? How important is to have Diner's, 
Optima, Carte Bleue, JCB, Maestro, Solo ... covered as an option for successfull selling, as addition to big US four (VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover)?

Thanks in advance for your time and efforts answering these questions.

It all depends on what market you're in. For example, we're a US company with no physical office in Japan, so there's no way we would ever be able to sell in Japan... Japanese companies just don't buy American software, full stop, unless there is a deeply localized version with a major physical presence in Japan.

So, yeah, in Japan you need to accept JCB, but that's the least of our worries trying to sell there. Pick the markets that you're going to be in and assume that every country is going to take a lot of work. (I heard a metric that said that a typical US software company needed to be at about $10m in annual revenue to justify starting to internationalize and open subsidiaries and so forth.)

For Europe (at least the part I'm living in), VISA and Mastercard are most important. Diner's and American Express are also used here, but less regulary. As far as I can tell, no other CCs are marketed here.

VISA, Mastercard, American Express are a big 3 I see everywhere internationally.  Also common are Diners, Cirrus, Maestro, and Plus.  Take a look into your target countries as well.  Check with the major banks in those areas and see what services they support.
