I think this forum is appropriate for the following question, but if not, I am happy to be directed elsewhere. 

For startup business planning purposes, I am wondering if anyone here has heard of a company with high volumes of transactions being able to negotiate down the level of interchange fees they pay?

More simply put, does Amazon pay the same fees for credit/debit card processing that Joe the local retailer does? If not, how much flexibility is there in the fees?

I greatly appreciate any thoughts.

Interchange is set by issuing members of the card associations (Visa and MasterCard), and the rates, fees and guidelines of interchange do not vary on an individual merchant basis; even if your name is Amazon.com.

However, I think you may be referring to thresholds. For example, Visa has three thresholds where if a (retail or supermarket) merchant has enough processing volume, they will qualify for lower interchange. These rates are published in Visa's interchange fee schedule that's available on their Web site. Look at page five for required annual transaction minimum, volume, etc.
