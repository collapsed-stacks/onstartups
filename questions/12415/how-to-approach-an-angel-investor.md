The best way is to get introduced. It rarely works to cold call or just introduce yourself. So, find someone that knows them and get an intro.

Most angels want an executive summary to start off with. If you get the meeting, they will be looking for your passion, drive and how you will make them money. Remember, they are investors, so you should think about how you will use their money to either build your product or get more money.
