I want to have a private label estore, selling clothes, preferably wedding dresses.

The clothes do not need to be white labeled. The clothes can have brands etc. I'm looking for the estore that is white labeled. In term, similar to amazon aStore, but with more robust technology.

Can somebody point me to the correct website?

<p>Personally I'm a big fan of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/" rel="nofollow">WooCommerce</a>. It seems to be the fastest growing WordPress E-Commerce plugin and it's completely free (as is WordPress). Having built a few plugins for WooCommerce I can assure you that it's very well built and has a very solid support community, a must if you're going to build a site yourself. If you're looking for something that's easier setup, but with a higher price, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.shopify.com/" rel="nofollow">Shopify</a> or <a href="http://www.volusion.com/" rel="nofollow">Volusion</a> which start at $29/month or $15/month, respectively. </p>
