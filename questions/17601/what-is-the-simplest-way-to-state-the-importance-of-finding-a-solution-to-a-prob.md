I've often heard the maxim "solve a problem" as the fundamental insight into creating a value-providing business. I was hoping someone could elaborate on this, but still keep it concise and easy to understand.

Are there repeatable processes to discover problems? How do you go about brainstorming and validating solutions? Does anyone have any good quotes related to this topic?

If your business doesn't solve my problem(s), I have no use for you and definitely no reason to give you my money.

**Places To Look**
Yourself - what are you interested in / know something about?
Other Groups you have Accessibility and knowledge about. If you know a lot of bar owners, work with them.

**Identifying Problems**
Listen to complaints and/or solutions - "You know what would be great?..."
Make observations and spot what is wrong. Others may just accept things the way they are / don't know any better.

**Potential Solutions**
Apply your expertise or find others who have it. If a solution to a problem is to cross-pollinate a daisy with a rose bush, I'm not your man. 

Get feedback from users as you work on solutions. Everyone would like a phone with more features than an iPhone, but not if it is too difficult to use and weighs 5 pounds.
