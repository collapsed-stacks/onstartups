If you're investing money, definitely go with Investor.

It depends on the context of the situation and what you're after...

 - **Investor**: screams $$$, but is the most prestigious title of the three.
 - **Backer**: sounds like someone who is supporting you in more ways than *just* money.  These are supporters that are giving you more than money...
 - **Pledgers**: that sounds weird, and is the least desirable of the three, a pledge might be a promise to give money, but it may or may not be binding, depending on the situation...

Hope that helps.

I like backer.  Investor looks too money based and pledge seems like you are rushing for a frat.

My interpretation of the words

- Investor : someone who provides capital or other real value to the venture
- "backer" - well - I have no idea.  This is someone who pats you on the back and says "good jo, i support what you are doing."  
- "Pledger"  - as in "I pledge to donate blood?"  

I don't see how anyone would really see the value of the 2nd two in fact or in nomenclature.
