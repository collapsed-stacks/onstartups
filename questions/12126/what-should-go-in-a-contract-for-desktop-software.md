When I release my desktop application in a few months, I'm hoping that after some demos that I will get some interest in the product! The application is B2B and the software price will be $5000. Because of the cost, the application will not be downloaded from a website. A full demo will be given onsite by me or possibly a distributor. The software is targeted at Child Fostering agencies.

How do I prepare a contract/quote for a customer and what should be in it.

At a guess, the contract/quote should include

 - cost of software
 - cost of user licenses
 - cost of annual maintenance (which will include support?)
 - cost of training
 - cost of installation
 - Pre-installation check
 - What else?

Some training could be included in the annual maintenance I guess, but extra training is chargeable. I'm also keen to avoid having the contract/quote look too complex. I think the customer may be put off if they just see an endless list of items along with a cost.

However, I need to cover enough areas so that the customer doesn't get a shock later on when I inform them that for me to do something will cost extra, so I need to include everything. The problem is, I'm not 100% sure about what that is.

I would include section for:

 - Payment Terms
 - Expiration date of the offer/price
 - Refund Policy (if any)

Hate to answer a question with a question, but what did your lawyer say?
