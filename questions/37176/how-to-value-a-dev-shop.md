Suppose you run a small dev shop with 4 people (all software developers) and have been doing dev work for few clients. For one of these clients the dev shop dedicates about 70% of the time on billable hours. Now, the client is interested to acquire this dev shop and get all employees to join their company. Is there a way/method that can be used to figure out a value for the dev shop if it decides to sell and go work for that company? Assume 70% of the dev shop's revenue is generated from this client. Thanks

If he wants to buy the shop he wants to see the numbers - that is standard due diligence. He knows what he pays, he then knows the total income and headcount. They may succeed, but realize that - if the client makes 70% of their revenue they can say no, but then loose the client. That does not make the shop valuable.

I'm no evaluation expert but typically a small consulting shop is worth about what it brings in as revenue every year. So if you bring in $1,000,000 in revenue a year someone may be interested in acquiring you for $1,000,000 is you have good margins etc.

So if your revenue is say $500,000 and 70% is made up from a single client I would assume a purchase offer of 200k would be considered reasonable.

Hope that helps - the real answer is, **it's worth what you would sell it for** :]
