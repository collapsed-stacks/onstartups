## Is a "Discount for first N sales" promotion a bad idea for low volumes?

G'day!

My company develops and sells off-the-shelf (or rather, download-from-the-web) desktop software to quite a niche market. Our most popular product has user numbers in the hundreds (although how many of them are *active* users, I don't know).

We're about to launch a new product (with limited functionality), partly as a way to validate the market we think is there. One of the promotions we're considering is to offer a substantial discount for the first few copies sold.

Thing is, when you're expecting relatively low unit sales and it's a brand new product with no existing validation (or social proof) from the market, is this type of campaign a bad idea? We're hoping to kick-start up-take, but would people view a goal of, say, "5 quick sales" as meaning we don't believe in it, even if we know the market to be inherently small...?

If anyone has hard data from studies done on this, that'd be great, but I'm interested in even anecdotal evidence.

I'd look for something in return for those first few free sales.  Talk to a few clients and offer the product free in return for a public (or at least on demand private) testimonial and reference. That gives you something to build on - product validation for you and customer references for future sales.

I've seen this approach used by several startups trying to get a new product into the market.
