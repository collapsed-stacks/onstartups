I am building a website that I hope will be very popular with college age students and I am planning on getting a few students in some nearby colleges to help pump up the idea to their classmates.  Being a college student myself I don't have a lot of funds to pay them well hourly and I wanted to see the best option to compensate them.

I realize I will have to pay them somehow and if it comes down to it I don't mind forking over something like $10 and hour but I want to know all of my options.

I am in a similar situation and what I did was agreed to pay them after my first sale. You could do something similar, like after an initial $X is made, you will receive a payment of Y. It worked out great because my roommates are my web devs. It also shows they have faith in the company/dedication to provide a good service/product.
