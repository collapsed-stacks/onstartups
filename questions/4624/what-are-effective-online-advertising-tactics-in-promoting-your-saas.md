My company sells a software-as-a-service. We're a business-to-business layout. SEO, press releases, Twitter, and Facebook aside, we're looking for other ways to get the word out. We're looking for other advertising means. As we're looking at affiliate marketing, we're told that that tactic doesn't work well for B2B set-ups. So what else is out there other than AdWords and Direct Media Advertising online? Or are these already the most effective ways to advertise? What worked for you?

It's going to be hard to beat AdWords for SAAS advertising. It does take some time to learn how to use it effectively.

Go to the places (virtual or real world) where your target audience hang out and talk about the issues they face (some of which your software solves)

Make relevant content that shows your customers you know their space and know the issues they have.  This could be unrelated to your software.

Make videos for online demos.  

Give away free versions.  Run contests for people who write the best sob story or other essay and the winner(s) get free versions.

Find some evangelist user who is willing to talk about your product - encourage them.  Give them the ability to give free trials or licenses.  

There's no quick fix - you just have to keep at the business and "build your brand".
