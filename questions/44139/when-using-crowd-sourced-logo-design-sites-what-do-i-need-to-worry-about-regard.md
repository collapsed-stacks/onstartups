I am using a crowd-sourced site to design my logo (examples of such sites: [99 Designs][1] and [Crowdspring][2]).  The way these sites work is you put up a prize (say, $200) and then several different designers submit candidate designs, from which you choose one.

In my case, the logo is a fairly simple design-- the name of the company in a certain font and then a few shapes.

My question is this: are there any legal concerns related to font licensing in logos?  Assuming the designer has licensed the font, am I able to use the logo provided as is without any further license agreements?

I'm a font designer and my question is, what is it you are having delivered to you?

 1. If it is a graphic (bitmapped) image at several sizes there are no licensing concerns.
 2. If it is a vector based image where **everything** has been converted to vectors, there is no licensing issue. 
 3. If it is a vector based logo with embedded fonts there **may be** a licensing issue. My font designs prohibit this usage unless you own a copy of the font. Some fonts licenses allow for this. Many don't.

<p>As Gary said, if the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordmark" rel="nofollow">wordmark</a> is just an image, you usually don't have to deal with copyright problems since most font licenses are triggered only if you download the full font. </p>

<p>If you have to download the font, then the answer depends on the license terms of the specific third-party font that has been used. For example, <a href="http://mbtype.com/license/" rel="nofollow">this font license</a> is non-transferable, so even if the guy who designed your logo paid for it, you have to buy your own copy. <a href="https://www.docracy.com/7428/pictos-license-agreement" rel="nofollow">This other license</a>, on the other hand, allows for use in client projects (this one is for icons but it's comparable).</p>

<p><em>This is not legal advice, etc. etc.</em></p>

Unfortunately, though crowd-sourcing logo design is great, there is the risk of designer using unlicensed and non-public domain font. You may want to ask designers to refrain from using fonts that require a license. Ideally they will create their own style font.

That said, this is your public image, so I would bump up the budget closer to $1K ($500 often does OK, but above that brings better designers).
