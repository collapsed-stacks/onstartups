<p>I am a scientist working in a research institute. I opened a consulting company and made its website more than a year ago. I listed my company in several websites. However I never got any inquiry from any individual/company so far. Could you tell me how can I get clients?</p>

<p>As with all businesses you probably need to increase the publicity your business currently gets. There are many ways to do this such as adverts, social media, Direct Mail to companies or clients that may be interested in your service or as you have higher knowledge in your field it may be worth guest blogging or having some original research being published. These actions should also be done quite regularly to ensure you are maximising your presence.  </p>

<p>Also, if you are purely running your business as an internet based one it may be worth setting up analytics to monitor the amount of hits your site gets. A low conversion rate typically means that either the client has found no value in your service or that have found an issue with your sites content.  </p>
