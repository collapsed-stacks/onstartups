We are incorporating a company, and it is decided that the [investor will have 51%][1] shares and divide the remaining 49% shares amongst the five founders.

51% + 49% = 100% share. That leaves zero percent for employee stock.

- How will the employees be paid?  
- And, what will they be paid from?

Are there many ways to pay employees their salary?

**Shares do not equal salary**.  Typically, the investor trades shares for cash, and from that cash development, operating expenses and salaries get distributed.  Of course, the investor needs to agree to the salaries (can't immediately distribute all the proceeds to salary!)  - and in this case, the investor has majority ownership so he gets to state what is acceptable.

You would pay them out of the money the investor gives you. I wouldn't recommend increasing number of shares because it puts bad strains on the investor relationship, and makes it seem like you didn't plan well. One question though with 5 partners, why do you need staff before you're earning profits? Can't you bootstrap it yourself until you start generating revenue?

In this case to award employees company stock you will have to:

 1. Create more stock belonging to the company that it can award
 2. Have each current shareholder return some of their stock to the company

Both of these ideas dilute the current shareholders.  You can, of course pay employees out of the company's profits and/or investment money.

When you sell something you make revenue.
Revenue covers operating cost and profit

    Revenue = operating cost + profit

Operating cost = investment that makes revenue

What makes revenue? The workers and the materials.

If you work in your company as CEO and head programmer or whatever, you can take out a salary.

Your investor does not work in your company, so he does not get a salary (unless you agreed on otherwise)


Also:

    Profit = expansion budget + excess

The expansion budget goes into the operating budget of the next financial time segment. The excess is paid out as dividends to shareholders.

Your investor gets the dividends, if any. You can make it so that the dividends are 0 each month, in which case the investor gets nothing, but can still make a profit by trading his shares.

I assume you thought wages were paid via dividends, which is where I imagine your confusion stemmed from.
