I use custom build datamining tool. It does search for potential companies in city, guesses their potential profile and produces offer. It pre-selects targets based on defined rule set. For example, companies using specific software solutions.

You can hire developer to do something to automate your current work.

DUNS number is the US, EU govs and many companies world wide do that.

e.g. Apple validates companies that supply App for AppStore using DUNS number. 

Certificate of Good Standing is another good way to verify company.
