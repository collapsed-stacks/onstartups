<p>I (call me "Charlie") have a successful proven technology that is widely applicable and founder &amp; sole-owner of a company.("Acme"). Acme's clients include retail, security etc.</p>

<p>I am thinking of approaching one of my acquaintances (let's call him Bill) - a very successful executive - to develop a mobile app around this tech and running it. It could really be a $1bn co in of itself. Bill himself thinks so!</p>

<p>I am in quandary how to structure it. It is for all intents and purposes a separate LOB - different customers, biz model, sales &amp; marketing approaches etc.
It could potentially be structured thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>A newco (LLC) with the Bill &amp; Acme as shareholders (Charlie
represents Acme as the office bearer), Acme licenses newco with a
exclusive tech license in perpetuity. In return Acme gets some
revenue share.</li>
<li>A newco (LLC) with the Bill &amp; Charlie as shareholders. Acme licenses
newco with a exclusive tech license in perpetuity. In return Acme
gets some revenue share.</li>
<li>Structure it inside Acme as a wholly owned subsidiary, with Bill
essentially being an employee with autonomy over newco.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some issues this brings up:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can the IP be delineated? Could an IP sharing setup work?  </li>
<li>AFAIK, newco could have difficulty with investors, since they would want to 
invest in acme. Or is this a common enough setup for them to be<br>
comfortable?</li>
<li>what if there is an offer to buy out the newco? how would that work?</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not sure how to even approach this....I know I should speak to an attorney and will do. But seeking some ideas from fellow entrepreneurs to learn how they approached this matter.</p>

<p>Joint-venture/IP splits like you describe are overkill most of the time. Try instead to work out a deal with Bill where he joins the existing company, launching a new division. Find an incentive (commissions and/or vesting stock) that guarantees that if this new division takes off like crazy, Bill is financially happy. And if it goes nowhere, you haven't lost much.</p>
