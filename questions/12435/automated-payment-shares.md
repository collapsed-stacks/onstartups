Does PayPal or any other online payment site have a way for multiple people to get paid for a product?

Say I co-develop software with a few people and I want to guarantee each developer a percentage of sales. 

example:
Lead developer - 40%
Developer 1 - 30%
Developer 2 - 30%

Then when a customer pays for the software through a website with PayPal (or other) the money get divided into each developers own account.

<p>and welcome to this site! :-)</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, no, payment processors don't have that. You could try to take a look at something like Alain Raynaud's <a href="http://fairsoftware.net/faq#promote" rel="nofollow">FairSoftware</a>, and see if it fits your needs.</p>

Yes, there are many ways to start a revenue sharing plan.  This would not be set up via paypal or a payment gateway directly -- rather thru some 3rd party software.
