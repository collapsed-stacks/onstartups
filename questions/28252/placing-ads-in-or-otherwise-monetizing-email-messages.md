I'm working on a voting website that allows people to run elections using ranked-choice voting.  Everything is currently free and without advertising, and I'm considering the best ways to monetize it.

Since I will be sending an email to every voter, I thought it would be good to place an ad at the bottom of each email.  However, it looks like Google Adsense doesn't allow this.

Any suggestions for adding ads to emails or otherwise monetizing them?

I think you should go for it but the adds should link to another website of yours, or a specific page on your site. 

However, that should be in connection with what you do. If the recipient was not interested in your e-mail, hey may be in another thing you offer...
