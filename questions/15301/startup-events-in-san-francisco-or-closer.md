Hi I am a Mexican entrepreneur working on a startup. I will be in San Francisco from November 8 to November 13. I am looking for some conferences, talks, and events to attend. What do you recommend?

I would absolutely search for startup oriented meetup groups in the SF Bay Area (there are a bunch - I belong to a couple). Look here ranked by size: http://www.meetup.com/find/?lon=-122.41942&sort=member_count&keywords=Startups&op=search&mcName=San+Francisco%2C+CA%2C+USA&radius=50.0&userFreeform=san+francisco%2C+California%2C+USA&show=results&lat=37.77493

Check some out, see what meetups they have planned. Post on their message boards and ask their members about conferences, talks and events during your visit. I think you'll have some good success.

Best,
