I have a question regarding patents:

- Why is no one allowed to do the same, like for example the **concept of groupon**? (there are many competitors like **gonabiit** or **tippr**)  

There are many social dating websites.  

- Can there be a datingsite patent?
- If yes, everybody is doing it, what would be the outcome?

You cannot patent an idea, only an implementation of the idea.

Patents are defined as a set of rights given by a state (a government or group of governments) to an inventor who comes up with some new and useful process (search algorithm), device (mouse trap), or composition of materials (drug)

those rights given vary by state but they all at the lowest level provide you with acknowledgement of being the creator of the process or device and the right to control who can create and use the process or device for the life of the patent.

Basically what this means is that NO you cannot patent a "dating website", but you can patent your client matching process that you created for a dating website.
