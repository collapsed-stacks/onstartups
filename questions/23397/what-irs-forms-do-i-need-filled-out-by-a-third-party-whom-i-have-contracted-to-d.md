I have a small company and am having another US based LLC (really just a single guy) do a fairly significant amount of work for me. Do I need a W9 filled out from him?

edit --------  
a couple of other issues not in original post (I guess costs aren't that significant):  
1. he's doing software development and part of what he is selling is a software package that costs ~5k  
2. there's prop about ~5k worth of costs for integration with current system

In that scenario, it seems like I'm writing a check to his LLC for software and another check for consulting services. Do I really need to do 1099 / W9 or is it just a deduction for me? Like I don't give Adobe a W9 if I buy photoshop.

Yes, W9 if he's a US citizen, and you're going to pay him more than $600. Then you'll use it to prepare a 1099 to send him at tax time (prior to 1/31). Have him fill it out, then keep it on file, if you are audited, they'll ask for this to validate your expenses to him.
