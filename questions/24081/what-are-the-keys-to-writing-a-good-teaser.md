I'm curious what are the main things required to make a good 2 page teaser, to be presented to a potential buyer of a company, a European company.

Some tips as well as links to examples would be appreciated.

Pardon my french but a Teaser is something aimed at customers in an advertisement on TV or in print. a Potential buyer doesn't want to see those things, he'll want to see your books.... your profits/losses/processes etc. You don't "tease" a potential buyer, especially not a "square/humorless" european company interested in buying you.

Maybe you're looking for what "landing pages" are doing? Like presenting the best features and some insights on your services.

If you are looking to be acquired but your target company has never heard of you, I recommend approaching them for a partnership discussion, not an acquisition discussion.

Why? Because it's a great way to educate them about your product, the synergies between the two companies. If there are no synergies of course, then forget about an acquisition.

Usually, if it's done well, at the end of the partnership discussion, one of the options that comes to the target company's mind is "why don't I just acquire you?" That's when you say: "I hadn't thought of it, but that sounds like something we should discuss further."

I would try and understand: 

a) What the buyer does right now and where does he wants to be over the next 5 years?

b) How does what you do right now help him get there?

c) In addition to a strategic fits are there any additional holes in his organization that you or your team or your firm can fill?

Then figure out how to convert the above in a conversation where as Alain suggested they realize that it would be a great idea to acquire your business.
