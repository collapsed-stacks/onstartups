I just started reading *The Entrepreneur's Guide to Business Law* and it is very good. Are there any other books you would recommend?

As an entrepreneur, my most valuable resource is my time.  Which means that I need to make sure I get the most out of the books I do read.

In general, I find that most business books have a few good ideas, and a lot of irrelevant text.  To get the most out of business books, I recommend either skimming though them or reading book summaries.

There are lots of different summaries providers, most provide some free trial of their books.

As for the books themselves, it depends on which stage you are currently on, and what you are looking to learn.  If you are looking for business strategy books, I recommend blue ocean strategy and judo economics.  Wikinomics is too boring and long to read, so skimming though the book summary might work.  The long tail also has some interesting ideas.

If you are looking for a book that will get you started after you have your general direction and business strategy, I recommend the art of the start.  If you are looking for time management advice, I recommend getting things done.  If you are looking for a book on negotiations, I recommend bargaining for advantage (getting you yes is also good, but to simplistic for the real world in my opinion).  If you need to know about product design, I recommend product design and development, 4th edition.  It is incredible boring, but has some very good information in it.


There are tons of books on every subject, from marketing to finance to self help.  Most of the books are not good, but once you start skimming though them or their summaries, you should spot the good ones very fast.

Also, universities usually have agreements with barns an nobles so that they have special sections in their websites where you can find which books are required reading for which subjects.  If there is a subject you are interested in, you can see what the professors recommend you would read (without having to pay the tuition and spend the time doing any homework :) )

First, you need some inspiration for actually wanting to start a business, and then never give up once you face some hurdles.<br>
Hackers & Painters is a great choice.

Next, business is all about people and connections so I'd go with these two:<br>
How to Win Friends and Influence People<br>
Never Eat Alone 

New Rules for the New Economy is another must have - amazingly accurate 10 years later.

Some Seth Godin books are a must to start you on marketing: <br>
Permission Marketing, Purple Cow

For the more strategic minded, these two are a must:<br>
Crossing the Chasm (hopefully you get to the point where you need this)<br>
The Innovator's Dilemma

Many more of course, but you gotta do some work, not just read all day...

<p>Here's what' on my bookshelf as of now: <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/2009/02/06/my-bookshelf/" rel="nofollow">http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/2009/02/06/my-bookshelf/</a> - it's a mix of business, design and programming books. I'll focus this answer on the business books:</p>

<p>Many years ago I read the first half of "You need to be a little crazy", which made me realize that I wasn't ready to be an entrepreneur, saving me a lot of time and pain.</p>

<p>When I was ready to start up, I would say "Crossing the Chasm", "The Art of the Start", "Erik Sink on The Business of Software" and "micro-ISV, from vision to reality" are the ones where I got most value out of. "Founders at work" was also good to learn that a) there's no such thing as first mover advantage and b) your first idea is usually not what you end up doing, so just start with whatever you have.</p>

<p>Now that we're doing OK, "Growing a business" is one of my favorites.</p>

<p>Books I didn't like: "The 4 hour work-week" (lame, I LOVE to work all the time on what I'm passionate about),  "Bootstrapped" (could the guy be more self-absorbed?) and Wikinomics (boring).</p>

One of my favorite books is "Know-How. The 8 skills that separate people who perform from those who don't" by Ram Charam.

It's not a 'start your own business' book but a genuine management book. Now I know, you're thinking what the hell do I need with a management book when I want to start a business. Well, though you definitely need some specific skills while setting up your company (which you wont learn from in this book) you get a very accurate idea about how to run a business. And since a startup is A Business, his 8 skills are very valuable.

Now we all know that most management books are full of s$$t, using big words and some strange characteristics to describe good management (the charismatic leader?). This one skips all that esoteric junk and distillates it down to 8 necessary skills or know-how's you need to master to be successful. Why too many bright people with good intentions f$$k it up because they have no idea how to do things.

To be honest, after reading so many business books and being in the business for long time what I realized is:

* If you don't know what you are looking for...none of the books will help.

While good books always expands your thinking and horizon but no recipe for success.

It just your passion defines you and your company in the long run.

Just my two cents :-)

<p>I have a bunch of summaries at a site I do as a side project, "Squeezed Books"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.squeezedbooks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.squeezedbooks.com</a></p>

<p>Most of the books are things I've purchased myself for my own edification and then summarized for the site.</p>

<p>The books that are best summarized tend to be ones that are perhaps not worth owning if you have a limited budget - they're the ones that take a core idea that could be described in a brief article and try and drag a book out of it.</p>

<p>In any case, some of my favorites:</p>

<p>"Information Rules"
It covers the economics of many high tech goods, which is timeless information - it will still be valid even if the underlying technology changes.</p>

<p>"In Search of Stupidity: Over Twenty Years of High Tech Marketing Disasters"
This looks at a lot of failures, rather than just "rah-rah" success stories.</p>

<p>"Founders at Work" is good because it covers so many different types of success and company (well, they're all high tech, but still).</p>

<p>Paul Hawken's "Growing a Business" is an oldy but a goody.  It says a lot of what you can find in other, later books in a very approachable way.  Also, the fact that he's not talking about high tech, and yet his advice still rings true makes it a good read - it's passed the test of time.</p>

<p>P.S. now I remember why I found StackOverflow so annoying at the beginning.  Every time I tried to do something it was "Dave, I can't let you do that... you have to have X points".  Bleagh.  I have links to all those books on my summary site (although these are the good ones, you should buy them) that I can't add.</p>

For more of a "case study" type of story, I suggest reading Jerry Kaplan's book, "Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure".  He chronicles his time as cofounder of Go Corporation. Its a lesser known story, but involves a lot of the famous silicon valley moguls who made it big.  I think of it as a behind the scenes tale of what went on in other valley companies while everyone was enchanted with Microsoft and Apple.  

Jerry's book has inspired me because it is told from his point of view as a genuine entrepreneur and gives a lot of the gritty details of what really goes on in the meeting room.  Also really interesting to hear what guys like Bill Gates were like back in the day.
