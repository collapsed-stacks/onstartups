This might actually be a trivial issue but, I'm still confused. I am starting a mobile apps and games company, which doesn't yet have any name(s). I say names because someone suggested considering the apps and games as separate entities. 

While I have myself started dev work, I could definitely use some help. So I've decided to hire a couple helping hands. I have some potential candidates that I'm going to meet over the weekend. But I would still like to post a job ad for the open positions.

Would it make sense to post job ads without telling who's hiring?

Yes.  We're beyond your stage and I still don't put our company name in the postings.  I'd just go for it.

You can call yourselves a "Stealth Startup".
