I am looking for a technical co-founder, but unfortunately my local relatives are not willing or not quialified enough for the task so I am thinking where else I could find a partner. I know a person who is working on open source project that is releavnt to my startup. Is this a good idea to contact this programmer and discuss partnership with him?

EDIT

I can paraphrase my original question. Does anybody know of a successful startup that was founded internationally?

<p>One of the places that the fact that he is a foreigner comes in to play with entity selection and setup.  There are limitations to ownership of some entities by foreigners (such as s corporations).</p>

Communication is key to a partnership, it amongst others is interlinked with trust. See how well you communicate and use your gut feeling to see whether you trust him. Communication with foreigners is mostly more difficult. If the person comes from a culture that is very distinct from yours (like Chinese vs. American), I would think twice about a partnership.

Yes, talking to a potential cofounder is fine. Be honest with him, and think about how well you know this guy before spilling all your secrets.

I'm a bit taken back by the lack of information in your post, and the fact that the local guys said no or are "not qualified" in your words. Could it be that the pitch you have for your startup is not quite compelling enough? Have you considered how hard it is to obtain work visas in most countries today?
