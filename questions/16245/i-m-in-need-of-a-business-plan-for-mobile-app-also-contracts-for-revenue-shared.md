Sounds like this will be a smaller boostrap business?

I would at the minimum come up with the following:

Mission statement and a vision for the next X amount of time (1-2yrs at least, longer would be tougher as mobile market is so volatile right now) 

Cost estimates (Will you need software, components?  Servers? License fees?  Phones? Plans?  Marketing?  Website development?  Management software/services? Incorporation fees? Attorney fees? etc)

Sales forecasts backed up by market analysis

Risk planning & aversion (what will you do if Apple stops you from releasing, or Android includes the feature in its next OS release, etc)

And last but not least: simple action plan

You need a napkin and a pen.  You need more of a partnership agreement then a business plan.  Then you need an application plan so your developer knows exactly what to build.  You need a marketing plan to understand how you plan on getting exposure on the app.

On the partnership agreement you need to discuss, ownership, responsible, how much profit you guys pull out, what you re-invest.  How you can buy each other out.  It is important to always consider an exit when forming a partnership.  That way both partners know their rights, and you never have messy "divorce"  

From my experience, most partners are often best as employees.
