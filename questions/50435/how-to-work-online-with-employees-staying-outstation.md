I run a small travel startup based in a remote town where it is hard to find skilled personnel or to get people to shift here. For this reason, I am planning to hire someone in a nearby town/city where it will be easy to find skilled individuals. As most of the work of our business takes place online, this looks certainly possible.

My question is, are there softwares (applications) out there, preferably free, which can help me in communicating with the employees and sharing documents/databases with them online. I am sorry if I may sound vague, but I hope you understand my questions. As in tools which help startups in remote organizational networking/communicating/management.

Another option could be something like Dropbox. Like one aspect of the Google Drive stuff, this would allow you to share files in their existing formats from a file on each of your desktops.

I have settled to use the following:

TeamBox for project management (awesome price for small groups)
Skype
Box.net for file sharing (best price and great features)
