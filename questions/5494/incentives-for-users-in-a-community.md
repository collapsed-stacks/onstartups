I'd like to brainstorm with some others on what you think are options for "incentivising" users to use a site in a community. eg. things like user retention, and increasing the odds that people are active on a site. 

Other than a point system, what other options are there? 

I see this site uses points... but I wonder, does that *really* help? For instance, I use this site more for the sake of helping others, learning, and thinking... than for the point buildup. 

Thoughts?

Some ideas:

 - Feature user-generated content. Reward good content, draw attention to your community, and help keep your homepage (or other main page) fresh with content (good for Google rankings).
 - User rankings and scores. Mostly covered by other posts.
 - Gifts. Sometimes it's worth your while to give big contributers gifts like hats and t-shirts, especially if your growth relies on word-of-mouth advertising.
 - Personally thanking and interacting. If you're small enough or have a small volume of user content consider thanking and talking with your users. This may also help you getting feedback and discovering why they contribute and what you can improve.
 - Give users control/ownership. Let them feel like what they're doing is important and having an impact. One example: let users vote and help you decide what new features to add.


Ask yourself what you're trying to achieve with this. Why would a user want to visit your site? Why would they take the time to contribute? Why would *you* take the time out of your life and contribute to some other site?

Making people feel like **part** of a community is the best way to keep them in it. Points are as much a way of recognizing contributors as they are a reward for activity. You can enhance it with leaderboards (monthly, then weekly as the community grows, so the barrier to achieving a spot on it isn't as high), blog posts highlighting the best user-contributed content, and other methods of recognition.

I think the points on this site serve two different purposes.  The case you discussed is where people contribute because they want to see their points increase.  On this site though I think the points also serve as a feedback mechanism on answers so contributors can see which of their answers are considered valuable and which are not.

Even if you don't like the points mechanism a feedback mechanism is still valuable.

I see the points as a way to quantify doing the activity you enjoy (answering, voting, showing approval, etc.). I enjoy playing basketball and find it more interest when we keep score, but I can't say I like seeing numbers on a scoreboard.

If the nature of your site is more social/collaborative, the number of associations made could drive the points/levels/badges/etc.

This site also awards users with additional capabilities as they use the site more/obtain a higher score.
