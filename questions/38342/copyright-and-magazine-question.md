OK, so this isn't strictly related to startups, but it's copyright-related so I'll ask anyway. It is similar to http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/35094/copyright-law-concerning-star-wars

I'm aware that names can't be copyrighted - but can be trademarked.

I am making magazines in a desktop publishing program, exporting them to PDF, and publishing them as flipbooks (digital books) on free.yudu.com.

All content within them is fictitious, and photos used are free ones from Wikimedia Commons or other free image directories

However, this is the main hurdle; I plan to call it either AutoMart or AutoTrader (it being a car magazine). The magazine content is all fictitious (places, phone numbers, towns, businesses etc.). It could be considered as satire/parody - probably affectionate parody.

It is not being sold for profit; it's just to show my DTP [desktop publishing] skills, and to appeal to auto enthusiasts.

I'm not trying to pass off as being related to *the* AutoTrader or AutoMart.

Also, should I insert an "all persons fictitious" somewhere in the text, and if so, where - on every page as a footer.

What's the best way to handle this situation? (bear in mind I live in the UK where copyright law is different).

Note, nothing has actually been published yet, any advice is much appreciated.

Pick a different name.  What you are describing sounds like trademark infringement (presuming that AutoTrader/AutoMart exist in the UK).

It's possible that you may be able to create a strong enough parody claim, but there's not enough to tell from your post, and you're still likely to generate unwanted legal attention.
