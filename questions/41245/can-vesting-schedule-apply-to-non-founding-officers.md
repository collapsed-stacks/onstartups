<p>Yes. In this context it's typically not called vesting; that term is often associated with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesting#Ownership_in_startup_companies" rel="nofollow">shares granted to founders</a>. The most common term for for the program that aplies for  employees is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_stock_option" rel="nofollow">stock options</a>. </p>

<p>The underlying principle of vesting -- that shares aren't just transferred at the signing of contract, but divided into tranches and given over time -- should absolutely be considered when creating a salary plan.</p>

<p>Whatever it's called, this is complex, and the tax laws and corporate laws that apply to you and your employees matter a great deal. See for example <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/35618/why-did-facebook-stop-giving-out-options-in-2007-and-start-giving-out-rsus-rest">this about RSU's</a>, and the discussion under the <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/stock-options">stock options tag</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that you obtain qualified legal counsel and tax counsel before you create a stock options program.</p>

Yes, anyone getting stock and/or options can have the stock and/or options subject to vesting.

I typically see vesting over 4 years, with a one-year "cliff" (i.e., the first 25% of stock/options vests after one year), and the rest vest either monthly or quarterly over the remaining 3 years.

I would add that founders equity sometimes opt for few/no vesting cliffs whereas officer/employee have regular cliffs (typically per year). To learn more about vesting cliffs, see: http://startuplawyer.com/incorporation/why-your-startups-founders-stock-should-vest-over-time
