There are two types of listings on CrunchBase, I'm referring to the company listing, not the people listings.

Yes.  Crunchbase Profiles are highly rated (in google) and will often hit the first page in an organic search for your company.  You should keep an updated profile with links, screenshots and other relevant information about your startup.

<p>During 2010, I've had 37 visitors from my profile on CrunchBase (<a href="http://www.conceptfeedback.com" rel="nofollow">ConceptFeedback.com</a>). Not great, but it's free, and like Jeff said, a way to get in to the organic results if you aren't ranking well yourself.</p>
