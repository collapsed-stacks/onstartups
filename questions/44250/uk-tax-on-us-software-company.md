This was partially addressed in another question, http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/26715/international-tax-on-digital-products-for-a-us-company , however, I'm still unclear as to what I need to do if the UK removes this threshold next month. Basically I'm selling software for download only, from California with a California LLC. Do I need to be VAT registered - most of my customers are in the UK - but I doubt sales will top the current threshold value.

I understand being UK-registered would cover EU member states too. But what about the rest of the world? How on earth do I keep track of all the sales taxes around the world? I'd rather not go down the route of Digital River or other online sales agents unless I have to. Currently I use Hikashop and Paypal for my website (for other reasons - I haven't started selling yet).

Thanks.

I believe the answer that you refer to is incorrect. I'm a fellow Californian, and can't speak about the UK laws, but in California you do not need to collect sales taxes for intangible goods (software for download).

The point is that the UK laws are irrelevant for your business. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs office has no bearing on you. Their rules are for the subjects of the British Queen (that's why its "Her Majesty"). You're not subject to British laws. They can demand VAT all they want, but they'll be thrown out of any California or Federal court. They can take it to their citizens (as California does when Californians buy from out of state and try to avoid sales tax - through the "use" tax which is basically sales tax on purchases from out of state), but its the citizens' liability, not the sellers.
