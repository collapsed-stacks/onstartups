I'm a private English-Chinese interpreter in China. People often send Email to me to ask my rate. As soon as I tell them my rate, they often don't contact me any more. I don't think my rate is very high given my expertise in this field. The problem, how I can deal with the price/cost inquiry tactfully?

Send them your rate with a direct link to a portfolio or reference.

You could say that your rate depends on the subject, deadline, complexity,... But above all, show them that **you are worth your rate**. Your message should be: hey, I understand my rate is a bit high, but if you want a quality product, you have to pay for it. 

Play on your customer's fears also, reminding them what their own customers may think if they give them a poor quality product. 

Good luck.

<p>To build upon what others have said, show them the value you deliver.  Including testimonials from previous customers is often effective in doing so.</p>
