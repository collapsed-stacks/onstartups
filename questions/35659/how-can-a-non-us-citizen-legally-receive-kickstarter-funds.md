My understanding is that only a US citizen with an Amazon payment account can create a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> project.

If there is no project member in the States, is there some sort of agency that could create the project and receive and transfer funds on the project's behalf?

  <p>To be eligible to start a Kickstarter project, you need to satisfy the requirements of Amazon Payments:</p>
  
  <p>Be a permanent US resident and at least 18 years of age with a Social Security Number (or EIN), a US bank account, US address, US state-issued ID (driver's license), and major US credit or debit card.</p>
  
  <p><strong>I'm not in the US. Can I start a project on Kickstarter?</strong></p>
  
  <p>You don't have to physically be in the US, but there are some US requirements to be eligible. Please read: Am I eligible to start a Kickstarter project? [<em>see above</em>]</p>
