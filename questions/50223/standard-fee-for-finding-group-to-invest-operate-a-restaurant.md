I am working with a group, on a greenfield location to find a restauranteur to invest and build/operate the location.  This is in a major tourist area, so foot traffic will be heavy.

My question, as I have owned restaurants in the past, but never done this - what is a standard fee I should charge.  I will be doing all the scouting, and helping to negotiate the lease (most likely a % of revenue).  I have known this group for many years, and I am not sure if I should set up a retainer, a success fee (and if so, what is the structure of the success fee) or retainer + success fee (with crediting the retainer back).

Sorry, just trying to get a feel for what the industry norm is.  I will be soliciting all people, and assisting with the negotiations etc etc.
