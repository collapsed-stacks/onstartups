We have had a social network website built and after some beta testing with friends and family we are now looking to get more users to register on the site. The site is aimed at posting good news only and we would like to get some advice on getting more people to the site and also possibly team up with other interested parties to develop and expand on the core idea. We believe there is a lot of scope for this site and would appreciate any input going forward.

What i would suggest is add some more functionality and **make it possible for others to contribute** to your system as well.(I mean simple plugins)

**Add a good revenue model to lure them in(Contributors/Developers).** 

You can do the following by running cleverly designed ad campaigns in Facebook. See to it that you initially lure developers. But before that see to it that you have such a structure to accept other applications.

This will have an impact in two ways

 1. They will do the marketing for you (by marketing their apps/their
    work) 
 2. You can market their apps since it would be something that can
        lure many.**An extra desert after a good dinner never hurts** :)

Blogging is one way to increase visibility, combining the use of Social Media to promote your "Breaking News" Blog Articles. 

There are many free methods of promoting your site that you can use, but paid promotions are the fastest methods to use to get the word out. Of course your Advertising Budget will have a lot to say about what types of promotions you should use. If it's ***good news only*** that you want, you may benefit from joining several Christian blog sites to help "spread the word!"
