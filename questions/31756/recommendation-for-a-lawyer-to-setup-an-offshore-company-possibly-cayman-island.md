I have setup an IBC my self in Belize, directly through Belize Bank. There is no need for a lawyer to fill out a very simple form and mail it for you. Here is the link

If it's just a company you want started a lawyer will be very expensive. Search for off shore company formation on google.  (I use SFM offshore based out of Geneva).

Maples & Calder is one of the best firms in the Caymans; I forget the others.

Do NOT set up a company yourself- there are all sorts of tax and other requirements, and the earlier in a company's life that a mistake is made, the more serious the potential consequences.
