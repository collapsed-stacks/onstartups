What are the best sited for work hour by hour like proofreading for example?

The high end ones, like Elance, are difficult for work hour by hour.

On odesk you can do that, but there are lots of fake accounts (not real persons) and its difficult to get applicants that have the required skills and addresses your needs.

Also it is little risk for them to  take on a job they can't do.  If they get a bad rating they can return the money and the rating is not visible.

I had asked a similar question on Quora and the best answer I got was Odesk. So it seems like there are not a lot of options for hourly (small) jobs. It might be a market opportunity for a  startup.

However if you are primarily interested in translation services than you should look at ProZ which is one of the largest translator communities online. Their job posting form is intimidatingly detailed however.
