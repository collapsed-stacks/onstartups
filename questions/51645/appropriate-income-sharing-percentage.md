<p>I've independently created a database that's caught on quite well - currently being used by 21 non-profits in Massachusetts.  A larger software development firm has taken note of this and is interested in forming a strategic partnership.  It would still be my database, they wouldn't get the copyright to it or anything like that.  And I would still do all the actual work on it myself.</p>

<p>Here's what this other organization would provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let me use their billing department to handle all the invoicing for me</li>
<li>They have a marketing person on staff that would write about me on the company webpage and submit articles to local publications</li>
<li>I would work in their office at least two days a week. (They have a giant office with tons of empty rooms.)</li>
<li>The owner of this company seems like a super great guy and, I'm sure, would be very helpful in guiding the future direction of my database - both programming-wise and business-wise</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking into account the above things that this company would be providing to me, what would be a fair percentage for future revenue split?  So, like, if one of my existing clients paid me $1,000 to build a special report for them... how much of that would be fair to go to this partnering organization and how much to me?</p>
