<p>Social media are indeed signals that the web search quality team at Google use to determine ranking on SERPS. </p>

<p>See Matt Cutts discuss it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofhwPC-5Ub4&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow">here</a>. 
And Danny Sullivan <a href="http://searchengineland.com/what-social-signals-do-google-bing-really-count-55389" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<p>Pay careful attention to Matt's caveats though.</p>

<p>Some recent analysis on SEOMoz site indicates that there is some correlation between social sites "Likes" (Google, Facebook, Twitter etc) and search engine ranking. It can be indirectly because Google have no full access to Facebook data. Also take in mind that correlation does not imply causality. </p>
