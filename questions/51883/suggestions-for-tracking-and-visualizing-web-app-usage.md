<p>I'm viewing our Web App as a extended Sales Funnel.  And I want to find a way to track and visualize that usage (and leakage). One way to do that is Google Analytics but I'm looking for other suggestions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Discover us</li>
<li>Try the App through the Guest login</li>
<li>Create Login</li>
<li>Login to app</li>
<li>Start a Lesson</li>
<li>Finish a Lesson</li>
</ol>

<p>Any other suggestions, other than "build our own"?</p>

<p>I think your question belongs on <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com">http://webmasters.stackexchange.com</a> rather than here as it refers to the operation of a website rather than the creation of a business.</p>
