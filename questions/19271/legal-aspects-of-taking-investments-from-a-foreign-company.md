There's quite a lot of documentation ([for example here][1]) about pros and cons of taking an investment from an accredited or non-accredited investor. However, I don't see any explanation when it comes to taking investment, f.i, from a foreign company.

A UK Ltd for example can legally invest in other companies to pursue any business opportunity that are  in the company's interests, but how this investor would be considered in a US startup? Will it be considered accredited/non-accredited according to its owners revenue/net-worth (but that's just a US law!)? Will they be considered non-accredited by default?

As long as a foreign investor can meet the accredited investor requirements, like any US investor, then the issues are really issues that affect just the investor on its end- mostly tax issues.  Be sure to do diligence on the investor, too.
