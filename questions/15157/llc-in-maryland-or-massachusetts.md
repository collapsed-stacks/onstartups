What are the advantages and disadvantages of starting a LLC in Massachusetts, versus Maryland?  It's a lot more expensive to file annual reports and get a license to operate an LLC in Massachusetts (512 for annual reports and 500 for the registration fee) than in Maryland (196 for reports and 300 fees), yet I was told that it was better to start LLC in Massachusetts.  

Does anyone know why this might be the case?

It's usually cheaper to register in your home state. If you incorporate in a different state, you'll need to register as a foreign corporation in your home state anyway, and there are fees and taxes associated with that as well.

How about Delaware?
