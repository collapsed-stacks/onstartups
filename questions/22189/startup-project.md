So we are getting a team together at the moment and starting the R&D of a new project. We want to set up an agreement that lays out our share of the revenue of the product if it was to ever reach that level. We know each of our %'s, but we want to make it official, so no one can get screwed over in the end.

Who would I contact to get something like this completed, and if I could do it on my own, how would I go about it?

Thanks.

Try legalzoom.com. If you're setting up a LLC, they have a pretty simple template for it. It will cost you less than $300. As long as you're not looking for anything super specific or unusual, they should do the trick for you. You can lay out the percentages for each person.

It's good lean option. I've used it several times. I've also used a lawyer for more complex businesses. LZ gets the job done cheaply for cookie cutter docs.

You should contact a lawyer and prepare written agreement.

<p>What <a href="http://foundrs.com" rel="nofollow">foundrs.com</a> sets out to do - albeit thinking about agreements that will turn into stock allocation rather than revenue share - seems very like what you want.</p>
