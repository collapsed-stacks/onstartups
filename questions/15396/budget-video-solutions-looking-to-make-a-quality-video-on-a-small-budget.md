I'm looking to have a professional quality video made of my company's mobile application.  My company already did this once before I came on board and apparently it carried a staggering $400-500 price tag.  Are there any good solutions In the vicinity of $200 or lower?  My quarterly budget is far from large, and an expenditure that big would definitely eat up a big chunk of it.

Thanks for your help!

<p>Demogirl is the cheapest quality screencast service I've seen online but have not used her. Have you considered just using a digital camera to record your own demo (if money is that tight)? Even without a video camera, you could take some screenshots and use <a href="http://animoto.com/" rel="nofollow">animoto</a>?</p>

Perhaps using a mobile emulator at your PC you can record the screen using a "screen recoder". I use camtasia to do that. It's about 299 dollar but you can record your own video with "auto zoom & pan" it's pretty easy.
