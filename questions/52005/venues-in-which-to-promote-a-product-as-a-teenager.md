<p>I'm fifteen, and I just created a product. I've got the code done, but I have no experience with the actually marketing a product. So, how can I, as a teenager with no money, promote my project. This product is open source, currently in an open alpha, and is a website testing program. Honestly what I really need are tips for a newby. I can understand if this question is too broad, and I apologize.</p>

<p>If its something serious, the press  loves young entrepreneurs. Another resource is the SBDC (at least in California, Google it) which governs the YEP (young entrepreneurship program.) </p>

<p>I'd recommend the book Lean Entrepreneurship by Eric Ries. Find a small market in a given area, get all the users onboard, then grow it from there. Checkout meetup.com if you need to find groups.</p>

<p>I can unfortunately only give you generic advice as I haven't seen the product, but determine who would use this product and try advertising directly to them. If it's companies, try getting in contact with local small businesses as you'll probably have much better luck than giant corporations. Look online for local businesses, give them a call (sound professional), and ask to schedule a meeting for a businesses pitch. Dress professionally when you go to the meeting. Don't just talk about the product when you pitch the idea. Show a demonstration as well. Most of the time, you might not even get the meeting but it's great experience for later on. And the odds dictate that if you try long enough, you'll get what you want.</p>

<p>Give people a free ride.</p>

<p>Who? Bloggers, prolific twitter users, people heavily involved in open source, popular websites creators. Make sure to mention that it's an alpha and kindly ask them to test it. If the will like they will blog about it. </p>
