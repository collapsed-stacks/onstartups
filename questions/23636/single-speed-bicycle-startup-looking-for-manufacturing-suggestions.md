## Single Speed Bicycle Startup - Looking for manufacturing suggestions

I am in the early stages of starting up a single speed/fixed gear bike company. There are a few smaller bike companies out there already that offer lower priced bikes in the $400 dollar range but they source all of their bikes and parts from Asia.  

I would like to have the bikes manufactured in the US and hopefully keep the price similar to what others are charging. While it would be cheaper to manufacturer overseas there are a few advantages to having the bikes built here (lower shipping/imports costs, ease of communication, and mainly quality control).

Initially I would create a set of bike designs but would later prefer to allow customization so each buyer could create their own bike on the site. The customization would allow different colored frames, wheels, tires, handlebars, etc.

Does anyone have any suggestions on who I could get in contact with about small batch manufacturing? Also, I would need a crash course to see if it makes sense to source all of the different parts and assemble on my own or get mostly complete bikes manufactured and assembled together.

This is my first time posting here so I hope to get some good responses and great suggestions!

You can't compete on price and manufacture small batches here.  Not possible.  If I were you I would just start buying older frames and converting them to single speed.  

Using craigslist and other resources find as many frames as you can for converting and build them up yourself or with cheap labor.

But building a bike business and competing on price?  Not possible.
