<p>We're going to raffle off  a bunch of stuff at our booth @  a Convention.</p>

<p>I'd like to encourage folks to spread the word.
So I'm thinking that if we offer <em>another</em> prize for spreading the word that might help.</p>

<p>I'm wondering how effective this would be (especially if someone has tried it)</p>
