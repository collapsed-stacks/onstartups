My question may be really simple, yet I can not find the answer.<br>What is your opinion about the most appropriate top-level domain for a personal resume that the address will be printed in a business card ?

I guess an online resume is really important nowadays and might be the first step to collaborate with others or just get a plus from some valued people like investors.

I would always go for .com ... people expect it. No harm in buying .me too .. but only do that if the .com version (or permutations thereof) is not available.

Make sure that people can type the domain in easily. I can remember only one .me domain name of a professional speaker.... otherwise If you were to ask me to find a website of someone... I'd type the person's name in to the url bar and add .com at the end.

[Wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.me)

> Montenegro.


Since it's a country code TLD and not a generic TLD, so I'd avoid it even though it might appear to be more cool than other options, as it falls under some other jurisdiction (unless you are in that country).

**.info** is good but I'll recommend going with **.com** if you want to build personal website which is more than just your resume.
