A company that I recently started connects clients and freelancers in a higher quality way via online project board. (Think craigslist on steroids).

I launched in beta about 2 weeks ago and several possible customers have already asked me if I would provide them with some consulting support during the process.

Its early on in the business I definitely do want to provide support to these customers, to find out the wants and needs. The real question is, **should I put a customer support number on my website?**

Why not?

Try doing it for free for now. If it generates more calls than you can handle, charge $X per call. If you still can't handle the calls, charge $X*2 per call. Repeat that process changing the amount until you get to a level you can handle. And be willing to change it more as/if the business grows.

As a founder your time is valuable, treat it as such.

Early on in your business when you don't have a lot of customers, don't have a lot of support and don't have a lot of ways to get great feedback.  Absolutely you should have a number and easy ways to learn from your customers.

Later on when you have most things figured out, and thousands of customers you can maybe remove that and replace it with a great FAQ/Knowledge base of everything you have ever been asked for them to sort through themselves.

But initially, yeah - hear from your customers.

I'm confused. 

> A company that I recently started connects clients and freelancers

Okay, but then
> several possible customers have already asked me if I would provide them with some consulting 

and
> I definitely do want to provide support to these customers


Some points to consider.
A "Possible customer" isn't a customer. And by customer, its nearly impossible to determine which player you are referring to (client, freelancer, or someone else). 

That said, I would consider putting a phone number on the site but limiting support to the particular "player" type that you are trying to attract.  Off the top, I would believe there are more "freelancers" than "clients", and that supporting "clients" needs via phone is important to gain traction.
