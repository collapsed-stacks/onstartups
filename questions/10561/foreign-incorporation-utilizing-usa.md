I'm a Canadian citizen living in Canada and I've been investigating putting together a US-based corporation. My partner is a US citizen, but it appears that it will be difficult for me to be able to get a visa in order to conduct business in the US, unless I can fork up significant capital which I don't have and can't receive from investors

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but here are my working assumptions:

 - I can form and run a US corporation but I may not be able to travel to the US to run it...
 - I can only get a visa if I invest personal money exceeding $150k (EB-2)

So now for my question: 

I'm considering forming a corporation outside the US -- perhaps Canada, perhaps Singapore (knowing one owner needs to reside there). I want to be able to hire contractors from anywhere in the world, but mostly in the US. After the company is successful, then we'd consider forming a physical location in the US. So anyone with experience in a similar situation able to share what they did or what might work in my case?

Thanks!

<p>I've helped approximately 20 foreign (mostly European, one Singapore) companies set up operations here in the U.S. Typically, they want to create a U.S. entity (corporation or LLC) to serve as a legal firewall to keep U.S. liabilities in the U.S., away from the foreign parent. (As you may know, in the U.S. litigation is both prevalent and expensive.)</p>

Do you want to live in the US? If your visits are temporary, I'm not sure you need a visa. Managment of the company can be handled by the US citizen.
