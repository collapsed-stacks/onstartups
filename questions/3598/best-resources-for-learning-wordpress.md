I am in the process of (re)learning Wordpress. General searches return a plethora of resources for learning, but it's difficult to cut through the clutter. What resources do folks here recommend?

Also, any recommended sites for good, free templates / plug-ins / etc.?

<p>For learning Wordpress, I found it best to grab a few templates (lots of free ones out there) and see how they work.  Very quickly you see the basic tricks.</p>

<p>For plug-ins, go to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/" rel="nofollow">standard plugin site</a> and go through <em>all</em> of the "popular plugins."  There's a zillion, but you'll probably have 10-15 installed before you're done, so it's worth pawing through them.  Maybe decide to add one a day.</p>

<p>There's also the curated plugins that <a href="http://wpengine.com/?a_aid=asmartbear" rel="nofollow">WPEngine</a> has. (Fair warning: I'm a co-founder.)</p>

<p>For more specific reference, these are the plugins I use (yes, actually USE) on <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Akimet (spam protection -- MUST have this; bots are crazy)</li>
<li>CommentLuv (auto-adds links to latest post from your commentors -- a way to thank and promote people who comment)</li>
<li>Get Recent Comments (sidebar of latest comments, again to thank/promote)</li>
<li>Comment Relish (auto-email person first time commented to thank them etc. -- people write me back a lot of times resulting in a tighter bond)</li>
<li>Google XML Sitemaps (creates proper Google sitemap automatically)</li>
<li>No Revisions (Wordpress saves a post revision every time you hit "save."  Yes you can revert but this fills your database with crap which slows down the database.)</li>
<li>Robots Meta (automatically create a "robots" meta-tag so search engines strobe your site correctly)</li>
<li>Secure WordPress (alerts you to common insecurities -- Wordpress is easily hacked!)</li>
<li>WP-phpMyAdmin (puts phpmyadmin inside wordpress - just convenient if you like to look inside MySQL)</li>
<li>WP Greet Box (messages like "hello digg user!" customized to source URL encouraging them to subscribe or whatever you want to say)</li>
<li>WP Super Cache (automatically caches plain-HTML versions of your pages so when you get slammed by Hackernews your Apache doesn't crater.  This <em>saved me completely</em>!!)</li>
<li>Yet Another Related Posts Plugin (adds "related posts" at the end of posts -- people really do click those and it's great for new subscribers who haven't seen your old stuff.  This plug-in does a good job scoring what "related" means.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Final caveat -- You'll notice these on my blog, plus things like the "Tweet this" magic button.  Most of these I've un-hooked from their standard installation and re-hooked using my own custom PHP, so that's why some of it will act/look differently on your site.</p>

<p>That's just the cost of getting things JUST the way you want.  But out of the box all these plug-ins are good.</p>

<p>I actually like books to learn things. Much less stress, and you can do it on the bus or in your backyard. </p>

<p>One I really liked was the Dummies book: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470149469" rel="nofollow">WordPress for Dummies</a>. It's fairly up to date and has a good description of the best plugins to use. </p>

<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51i2Vswlb%2BL._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS75_.jpg" alt="WordPress for Dummies">  <img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wSzPl-bmL._SL500_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-big,TopRight,35,-73_OU01_SS75_.jpg" alt="WordPress 2.7 Complete"></p>

<p>For more detail, try <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/184719656X" rel="nofollow">WordPress 2.7 Complete</a></p>

<p>One of the better places to learn WordPress by asking questions is the recently launched <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/" rel="nofollow"><strong>WordPress Answers</strong></a> by StackExchange (from the same company that runs this forum.) If you have a WordPress question chances are excellent you can get it answered <em>WordPress Answers</em> just like you can get startup questions answered here. </p>

<p>I go to <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com" rel="nofollow">Smashing Magazine</a> for all things Blog Creative.</p>

<p>They just tweeted a link to the <a href="http://storecrowd.com/blog/wordpress-optimisation/" rel="nofollow">Ultimiate Wordpress 2.8 Optimization Guide</a> - very interesting.</p>
