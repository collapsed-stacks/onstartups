Folks,
  I've been approached by a CEO of a startup to do the development piece of their business.  Most of the programming/design will be either done by me, or supervised by.
  
  What is the normal/good starting point for asking?  

  Would asking 10% from future proceeds be a fair start?

Thanks!
