You market by showing how you differ from the competition. You start small, and then work your way up. The first sales may take the longest, but then you use that momentum to get your next set of sales, and repeat.

It's all about standing out.

We constantly have to change and expand our marketing techniques with the times.  You need to set up a marketing plan and do some research to find out what sets you apart from the rest. What makes you different?  What makes you better?  What can you offer clients that the next company can't or not do as well?  

You niche needs to make you stand out in the form of your marketing.  You need to be creative and figure out what marketing campaigns are working for your competition.  Your competition is your biggest teacher in many respects. 

We offer a free marketing plan and research template on our website all you have to do is register which is also free.  http://smallbizbreak.com

Promote anything that makes you and your company special since the market you are in is not.  
Be a new and highly knowledgeable source of information in this industry. After this, people will be interested in hearing about your products & services.
