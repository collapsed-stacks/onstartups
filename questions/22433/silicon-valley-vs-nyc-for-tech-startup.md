The biggest benefit to being in Silicon Valley is that it's easy to raise money with the heavy concentration of Angels with money to burn.

The biggest drawback of being in SV is that the competition for good technical talent is extremely tight.  It's tough to compete against Google, Facebook and Twitter for talent.

It's also about what you do. A lot of Media, advertising & Video (software) startups are based in NYC on purpose as its the epicenter of advertising and media. More traditional software, web applications and technology position themselves in the valley.

<p>Can't really comment on the differences but I can tell you that if you're in the New York area, groups like <a href="http://www.nytech.org/" rel="nofollow">New York Technology Council</a> are incredibly helpful. The City government has good incubator support. Plus we're seeing groups like the <a href="http://eranyc.com/" rel="nofollow">Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator</a> engaging in the New York City market. </p>

<p>An exciting time to be doing a start up in New York. </p>
