Say I bought a domain last summer for $9.99 and sold it later for $50,000, how would that be taxed?  Capital Gains?  Or something else?  Eg, how much of the proceeds should I set aside for Federal, State, and Local taxes at year end?

Anyone here sold domains at a profit and had to figure out taxes for them?  Strangely, very little info on this subject on the net.

PS - Not sure if this is the best site for this question, but I see a few other questions here on the subject of selling and valuing domain names.

The short answer is that this is probably a capital gain. The exception would be if you regulary engaged in the business of buying and selling domain names.

As to paying taxes, you can be assured that virtually every time you make money there will be taxes involved. The amount will depend on a lot of things outside the scope of this question such as your other income and expenses.
