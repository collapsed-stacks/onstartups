programming is my hobby and I am not ready to leave my other profession yet. I have developed few windows applications, mostly on VB, some small scripts in python, C++, and so...never touched java or objective C

Now, I have few game, app ideas and I am sure they don't exist in iphone and android yet, and even browser based. Now , I want to develop those games in 5-6 months of time and I want users to be able to play from any platform, browser based, android, iphone, etc. just say like Zyanga poker. 

I can pretty much give the details of games and even come up with some algorithms and /or idea in most states. So, how much it will cost to develop such program? Should I learn and do programming myself? or should I use unity like program for cross-platform deployment? what about looking for some investors or giving share to programmers, if so, where can I find such possibilities?

Thanks..


and by the way I asked the same question in Stackoverflow and was recommended to ask here

<p>First I suggest you read this article on "<a href="http://blog.riverofnewsapp.com/2010/10/how-much-money-can-you-make-on-app.html" rel="nofollow">How much money can you make on the iOS App Store</a>" so that you can calibrate against a common misconception that you will make a LOT of money.  It's certainly possible, but it's definitely not the norm.</p>

<p>If you have the skills to program the games yourself and continue it as a hobby, I suggest you do so.  Paying professional iPhone/Android programmers to do it for you will likely not be a cash positive move. I guess I can't really say that without seeing what your app does, but for the majority of apps on the app store, this is the case.</p>

Your best bet is to build the app using AIR.  It will support every platform except IOS (ipad iphone, ipod touch).  You will have 90% coverage.  If the game does well then you can build it again in Objective C for those two devices that seem to hate flash.

I will answer your questions one by one: 

**Releasing it on all platform (web based, iPhone, Android) and learning it yourself**  
Well, if you ask me, all this platforms are completely different from each other, I am a full time web developer and also have developed few native apps in Java for Android. Learning all this platforms may be possible for one person, but to expertise in all of them is not a one man show. There are alternatives like AIR, PhoneGap/HTML5, etc. But if you ask me, the performance and overall user experience that you get could not be compared with native development. 

So, you can learn it yourself and can release it on all platforms, but 1) It will take time 2) You wont get professional quality, just like it was built by an expert 3) You would be able to develop small and simple apps, trust me Zynga Poker was not built by one person, the back-end infrastructure and servers etc. needs a lot of efforts and money.

**Regarding getting professional help and sticking to your idea**  
Well, I also have several great app ideas that I am sure could make millions if implemented correctly, lot of us have them. But first we need to think, how your idea would change people's life or help them solve their problems, is there any need for it, or why would they use your app? There needs to be a lot of thinking before you can move ahead to investment. 

Regarding getting professional help, I am sure it would cost you a lot if the implementation needs a lot of programming, that depends upon the idea you have and what needs to be done to implement it. Offering a share to programmers, would hardly work (based on my experience in industry). Getting an investor or making him agree on your idea that it would work is equally hard. But you can try your luck on kickstarter.com and angel.co

One more thing, like Michael Pryor said, not all app developer make a lot of money and there are many, many app developers who don't even get their investment back.

Hope this helps!
