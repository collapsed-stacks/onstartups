My post is not really a question but more of a person search or perhaps a public announcement.

I am developing a startup, currently in the brainstorming stage and I am in need of a partner who is a web development master, or at least master in training.  My idea is to build a web portal/networking site for people in the entertainment industry (actors, writers, makeup artists, directors, agents, editors, set designers, photographer, models, etc).  There is currently no website that let’s entertainment professionals network and connect in an environment designed for that purpose.  Of course the entertainment profession is desperately in need of such a site because of the project based nature of that industry and the need to always meet new people.  The initial target user will be persons in the industry followed by anyone who has an interest in the industry, which, if current TV trends are an indication, is everyone!

This is a high risk high reward venture.  As someone who has worked on Wall Street for the past seven years I laugh in the face of risk.  I am joking of course, but I do want to make this site work.  I have some web startup experience but that was 10 years ago while I was still in college.

I am looking for a friendly, positive, and web savvy person who wants to build the next big thing and be a partner in the business. PHP experience would be great.  Living in the NYC area is a huge plus.  Everything else is icing on the cake.  If you are interested please email me at tradingtime212@gmail.com and tell me a little about yourself.  All emails will be kept confidential.

Thank you for reading.

<p>Best of luck in your search!</p>

<p>The topic of finding co-founders, especially technical, is age-old. And it's non-trivial. Of course you need someone that you work well with, and just picking someone from their experience is going to be really tough. A startup is like a marriage, and you just shouldn't marry anyone.</p>

<p>I suggest you also post to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">Hacker News</a>, as there are many tech-savvy, business interested people hanging out there. OnStartups tend to be a little more business oriented. You may also be lucky with the Match.com for co-founders <a href="http://www.startupwithme.com/" rel="nofollow">Startupwithme</a>.</p>

<p>Being a CTO myself I'd like to advice you to read two pieces about finding your co-founder. Firstly, I can't encourage you enough to <a href="http://ror.kateray.net/post/1312957018/the-internet-teaches-you-ruby-on-rails" rel="nofollow">go learn programming yourself</a>. At least consider learning the basics. Unless you know some of it you're going to have trouble communicating well, since you'll not be able to discuss the finer details. It's just a very good idea for all tech company founders. Seconly, read this piece on <a href="http://dave.is/businesspeople.html" rel="nofollow">An open letter to business people</a>. Understand that there's a huge difference between being a founder and being your dev-guy. If you're serious about this, commit.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
