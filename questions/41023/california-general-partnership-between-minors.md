My friends and I have created an Android game that is free but has ads to generate revenue. For the purposes of taxation, we wish to create a general partnership in California, but we are all minors (15-16). How do we go about doing this? Are there alternatives to forming a partnership that will allow us to divide AdMob money among us without a company?

I've checked out this link:

It seems like we'll need to fill out all kinds of forms other than GP-1:

And it also seems like the partnership will have to be formed by our parents as opposed to us directly? Can someone help?

We're trying to minimize our start-up costs, since we don't have much capital.

The problem is your ability, as a minor, to enter a legally binding contract. I suggest talking to an attorney.

I'm pretty sure that the Android Market rules require participants to be 18 years old or older, for that very reason.
