Google Analytics (and similar) gives you a ton of numbers on every conceivable axis.

For me, I get lost in the options, filters, and numbers.  How do I turn this pile of data into *actionable choices?*

Which of this data is important?  Which custom reports should I build to see it?

<p>Everything I know about analytics, I learned from the following two posts:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/08/12/google-website-optimizer-case-study/" rel="nofollow">Web Optimizer Case Study</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/05/19/vanity-metrics-vs-actionable-metrics/" rel="nofollow">Vanity Metrics vs Action Metrics</a></p>

<p>Biggest takeaway from these is that A/B testing is what the situation calls for 9/10. And for that, there's Google Website Optimizer. </p>

<p>Two things I would recommend:</p>

<ol>
<li>Visit the <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/" rel="nofollow">Occam's Razor</a> blog by Avinash Kaushik.  </li>
<li>Get yourself a copy of the book "Web Analytics An Hour A Day" also by Avinash</li>
</ol>

<p>There is so much good information about analytics from these two sources.  Avinash works at Google but he does a good job of writing about analytics without a particular toolset in mind.</p>

Excellent question!

Here's a few of my opinions on the topic:

 - Focus on conversion % (as Eric Ries explains: page views is simply a vanity metric - it's almost always going to increase and doesn't really provide you with any **insights**)
 - Segment Google Analytics information into at least three profiles: Organic, Referral and Search. This will allow you to drill-down and understand each segment and potentially gain some more meaningful insights.

Would love to hear what other suggestions people have.

I'd recommend picking up a copy of Avinash Kaushik's "Web Analytics 2.0".  It's a great read and will definitely generate some ideas on how to convert a pile of data into actionable insights.

It's a bit of a "heavier" read than many marketing books (including mine) but well worth the effort.
