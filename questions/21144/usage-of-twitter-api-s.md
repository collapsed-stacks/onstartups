Any legal issues with using Twitter's API (posting, reading) when you build a twitter client? do you have to be "licensed" by twitter for this? do they impose limitations on you to keep their client's in an advantageous position?

<p>Your access is controlled through the application tokens.</p>

<p>Although Twitter has the right to cut off your application by revoking permissions without publishing the reasons, I believe they won't go that route as long as you're playing by the rules defined in their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms" rel="nofollow">TOS</a>.</p>

<p>The official Twitter client uses the same API as any other dependent application.</p>
