<p>We have just finished and launched our web project. It is a kind of social platform for companies one of its tasks also enable companies to publish jobs advertisements.
Every country would have a dedicated platform to advertise about their products and job advertisements (i.e. craigslist).</p>

<p>The question is "as we are not located in US (we are in western Europe) can companies and individuals use our website in the US? Or, do we need to get any permit from US gov?
I know some countries do require a permit to launch any website which offers job advertisement.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You don't need a license to launch the website for U.S. citizens who will view it only.  However, should any U.S. citizen or business provide you with funds for any reason, then YOUR business will need to be registered; not your website.  Good Luck.</p>

<p>As long as your business is not physically in the US or organized under the US laws, US has no jurisdiction over it whatsoever. The most the US government can do is to require those who are under its jurisdiction make withholding on payments remitted to you.</p>

<p>I don't know of any permit that would be required from the US government (or any state or local government) to operate the website you have described.</p>

<p>In the US job posting/recruitment isn't regulated. So no you don't need a license. </p>
