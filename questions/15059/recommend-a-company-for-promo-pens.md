I'm looking for a **legitimate/affordable/responsive** company to order some promo pens from (with our logo etc).

I've found http://www.pens.com/pens/ via Google, they look legit, but I thought I'd ask here before ordering from those guys.

<p>I have bought pens and other promotional items from <a href="http://www.vistaprint.com" rel="nofollow">VistaPrint</a> in the past, they ship very fast and their prices and quality are great. They offer freebies for most of their stuff... check out their business cards as well, they always have a great deal on those.</p>

I've purchased a lot of promotional supplies (t-shirts for Startup Weekend, pens, business cards) from a company called AutoMall Direct. They mainly provide items for auto dealerships but they accept orders from anyone and are usually 10% below others' prices. No website (keeping their costs down I guess!) but their phone # is 800-228-2556.

(They'll send you links to the suppliers' website to look at specific pen models, of course.) Most promotional pen companies all use the same wholesalers. The main factors for you to consider are (a) price and (b) whether they can steer you towards quality pens or not. Ever had a pen run out of ink right when you needed it? You don't want your name on that pen.
