What is a strategy to get people to sign up and post content to my social website that is location-based community-driven content.

Its kinda similar to this website. How did these guys get the snowball rolling? I can code but I'm very dumb at marketing.

One of my ideas is to post adwords targeting fledgling writers trying to be noticed. I'm running out of ideas.
