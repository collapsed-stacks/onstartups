BLUF: Would it be better to use governement subsidises to help a startup take its first steps even if it mean limiting the product to a french-canadian audience or open it to the world audience and maybe forfeit those subsidies?

SITUATION: Gouverment here is very friendly the industry in with I'll be launching. The province of Québec have 2 of the Top 6 cities in the world in the videogame field. So the location is good for me. The thing is, I have to choose between focusing on making a product for the Québec audiance first (i.e. in french) to qualify for most of the goverment help (which can be 30% of employee salaries, 250k$ loans, other tax breaks, investments, etc). Yet, I am unsure that the local audience is big enough to see sufficient growth in a short time frame to make the day to day operation viable. 

On the other hand, focusing on the world right from the start might be a real "Fly or Crash" situation, being way more difficult to execute. This time though, the critical mass is more likely to exist (and in a short time frame) and chance of survival once that critical mass is attained is much greater.

What other financing alternatives do you have?

I would take the government loan. Translating the  videogame into other languages is not a big deal (although be careful with translations!) and if you need to modify or make some adjustments later on, I don´t think that will be a big deal either. 

I don´t know how things are in Canada, but in today´s economy, getting a $250k loan is not easy.
