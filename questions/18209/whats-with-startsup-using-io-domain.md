<p>The .io domain is allocated for the British Indian Ocean area:  <a href="http://www.nic.io/rules.html">http://www.nic.io/rules.html</a>.  Some start-ups seem to like using these types of top-level domains to build cutsey domain-hacks; <a href="http://pistacch.io">http://pistacch.io</a>, <a href="http://moustach.io/">http://moustach.io/</a>, <a href="http://twit.io/">http://twit.io/</a>, etc.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.io is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the British Indian Ocean Territory.</p>

IO is a popular programmer nomenclature for Input/Ouput otherwise shown as I/O. It is also the devs way of being cute with the name

The use of the `.io` domain has a few benefits:

 1. The .io namespace is far less crowded, which means you have a much better chance of getting your domain name.
 2. It is shorter than .com, .org, and .info and while it is different, it is still easy to remember.
 3. As mentioned by others, I/O (input/output) is a term which almost all people with a background in computers will understand, and thus, it resonates well with them.
 4. It's new and different, which makes your startup stand out a bit and is great for marketing purposes.
 5. It just sounds cooler than .com ;-)
