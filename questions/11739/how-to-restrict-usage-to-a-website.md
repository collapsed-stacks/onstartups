The simple answer is: you do not. Depending on what type of site you have - you may piss up users which are taking the priviledge of traveling for business or holiday reasons and suddenly can not reach your website anymore because you decided for some funny reason not to allow access from outside the US. You may also have a serious issue with international networks (like people using a satellite internet connection that does not register as "US owned").

THat said, http://www.ip2location.com/ sells IP address information data, and the rest from here is programming. The first step of which may be getting rid of GoDaddy.

But first really think of what you are doing here.

This is a bit of a technology question and may belong at something like stack overflow.  My understanding is that each country has different IP ranges and so you can restrict on that.  

Another thought is restrict on people creating user ids with verifiable addresses in the states.  This way if someone travels they can still have access.

Why would you want to restrict your website to the US? IF you really want to block consumers outside of the US, then just make it clear on your website that you only offer the service/product in the US. Using technology is not the way, as it has its difficulties as explained by John and NetTecture.
