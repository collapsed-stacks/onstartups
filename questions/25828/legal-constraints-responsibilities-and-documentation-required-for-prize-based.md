I'd like to run a prize based promotion in the USA -- and looking for suggestions on legal constraints, responsibilities, and documentation required to execute one.

Yes, I know there are lots of rules, and they vary based on where the person enters the promotion, and if selected, where they receive the prize -- BUT someone's got to have some experience and/or suggestions to get me rolling in the right direction.

<p>I don't have any experience about the US view, but you might take a <a href="http://rafflefaq.com/united-states-raffle-laws" rel="nofollow">look at the rules for things like raffles</a> to see if that helps.</p>

<p>As you say, it varies from state-to-state.  That first link has a list for most states, though. For example, <a href="http://www.ct-clic.com/TradeLicenses/appView.asp?AppView=Bazaar%20Or%20Raffle%20Permit-Initial___Permit%20to%20allow%20qualifying%20organizations%20to%20conduct%20a%20bazaar%20or%20raffle___225___39&amp;appID=225" rel="nofollow">Connecticut's link takes you here.</a></p>
