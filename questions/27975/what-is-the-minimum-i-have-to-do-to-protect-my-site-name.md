I've been running a niche dating site for the last year or so that has done pretty well. I have been running it without any legal structure, registration, etc. Basically I don't exist on paper. 

I would like to do the minimum to ensure that somebody can't come along and claim my site name - do I need to register a trademark ? Register a company ?

Thanks in advance.

The absolute minimum? Use it. 
The next, put: (c) 2011 and your name on your marketing material. 
The next. . . . . it goes on and on. 

None of it is relevent if you do not have the means to protect it. So focus on building your effort so that you can afford to become a legal entity and "backfill" on securing your IP.
