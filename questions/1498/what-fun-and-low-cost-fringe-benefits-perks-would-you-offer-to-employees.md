Let's face it. As startups, we can't really offer top-dollar salaries to our employees. But we can offer some fun benefits that the big companies can't/won't. Here are a few that we have that seem to be pretty popular:

 * **Super flexiblity** - there's no "can I use four hours of my Personal Time Off to go renew my licence" crap - just do what you gotta do, and make sure you get what you need to get done
 * **Random Range Time** - when the time seems right, we grab the clubs and head to the driving range; or, on other days, grab the guns and head to the firing range
 * **The Scotch Library** - over 50 single malts, perfect for the 6 o'clock Scotch
 * **The Snack Budget** - it's not much, but a few hundred bucks can buy a whoooole lot of soda and munchies

I was also thinking of buying one of those [Arcade Legends][1] machines and possibly a pool table. Not that we want to make it too fun, though...

So, what would you do? What fun benefits/perks do you have/give/love?

We have an awesome workplace.  Here are some of the perks we offer:

- **Flex time** (actual flex time - work whenever you want)
- **No dress code**
- **Free snacks and fruits** 
- **Free fountain drinks**
- **Pay for 1/2** of any athletic club membership (we don't pay 100%, otherwise many employees never follow through.  50% provides the proper incentive for those who actually exercise.
- **Game room** with two xBox 360's, ping pong, and 4 pinball machines. (2 of the machines are set to free, 2 are set to $.25, with the proceeds going to the company's designated charity)
- **Dry Cleaning** - free Pick up and delivery
- Four weeks vacation, **5 weeks** at 10 years
- **1/2 day off (paid) on Halloween** so you can get home in time to help your kids with their costumes
- **Full company financials** available to everyone (Balance sheet, income statement, etc.)
- **Fun Days**: when we land a big contract, everyone in the company gets a day off to do something specifically that refreshes them.  Everyone who participates turns in the story of what they did that day, and we vote a winner, who gets $500.
- **401k Match**
- **Match giving to your charity of choice**, up to $500 annually
- **Training reimbursement** for any work-related material, books, etc. that you purchase to enhance your work.
- **$1,000 bonus for any Microsoft certification**
- **Use company's wholesale suppliers** for a big discount on your your personal purchases
- **Use of any company equipment for personal use**
- **Take home anything from supply cabinet for personal use**
- **No internet browsing policy**
- **Free cell phone** for business *and* personal use
- **Family Leave applied to fathers, as well as mothers**

Thats all I can think of off the top of my head.

Our startup has an interesting concept, that works really for us.  No formal vacation policy, no hard and fast rules on telecommuting or work hours.  We ditched a traditional rule set, when we saw how well this system worked for another start up.

If you want time off, from a long lunch to a four week vacation, you work it out with your team of 2-4 people.  If you want to telecommute you just coordinate with your team to be sure the work gets done.

We've completely gone out of the business of managing bio-mass. Instead we trust our people to strike a good balance between work and personal lives.

Surprisingly, I think people work harder under this system than in a traditional factory style 'Taylor' system.

From the point of view of the BoD this takes unpaid vacation off the books as a liability, so they are cool with it.

Many of your employees are parents.  And whether you like it or not, their families come first.  

That being said, as a parent, you never want to lose a job that gives you parental freedoms to:

 - adjust schedules as needed to pickup kids from school
 - meet with teachers
 - go to school events
 - go to the kids' sporting events
 - volunteer for field trips
 - etc.

**Understanding of a parent's needs is the biggest free perk you can offer.**

More than snacks, lunch.  It's not as expensive as it sounds (people don't expect sushi), you can leave Friday out of it (Fridays everyone goes to lunch out), and bringing lunch in actually cuts a lot of wasted time out of the day without anyone feeling like they're working more.

Some of the things the company I'm at is doing right:

- **Free breakfast** - Every day there is fresh bread, breakfast meats, fruits, juices, and pastries but there is something special about some days so that folks get variety. Some days there are eggs so you can make breakfast sandwiches, some days there are Pop-Tarts, there is a Salmon day, and Friday (oh delicious Friday) there are breakfast tacos.

- **Stocked Ice Cream Freezer**

- **Multiple coffee machines** - Traditional and the Keurig.

- **Breakroom Games** - We have a pool table, foosball, and a 360 with an assortment of games.

- **Library** - Stocked with a lot of interesting programming books, as well as some other light reading.

- **401K Match** - Pretty standard in an employee's eyes. It's not if there is a 401k match, it's how much.

- **Gym Discount** - A lot more developers want to go to the gym nowadays.

- **Crunch Lunch** - Ordering a decent lunch for everyone pays dividends when they'll stay at the office, take the 15 - 25 minutes to eat, and then get back to work.

- **Birthday Celebrations** - The balance comes in the amount of people at the company, but cake always works.

I keep a list of those for when I eventually get to employ people at my current startup (soon, hopefully). Among the things not mentioned already is one of my favourites:

Self-managed budget / "Company pocket money": On your job, you're regularly going to want stuff like books, a new monitor, a USB-controlled nerf-rocket launcher, whatever. Get a company credit card for everybody and let them buy what they want. (I think I got that from 37signals)

**I think this is great for various reasons:**    

 - it shows your trust in people, 
 - it lets everybody help make the workplace great, 
 - it shows people you care about what they want, and 
 - my guess would be that it costs a lot less than the amount you'd have to add to the salary to get a similarly rewarding effect, i. e., my bet would be that it's a lot more fun to buy books for $50 on your company's credit card than having that $50 extra on your salary.

I would reckon that mutual trust and general decency put a sufficient bound on the amount people spend, so it would not have to be bounded explicitly.

 - Free lunch solves a problem: I no longer need to think about bringing a lunch, cash for lunch, budgeting for lunch etc.
 
 - Parking spaces mean I don't have to hunt for a spot when I am in a hurry to get to my desk.

Give them the absolute best tools and environment to do their job even if it means overdoing it. The obvious example is for a software developer to get the 30" monitor, the fastest computer, etc; but it can apply to other areas, e.g. smartphones, whiteboards, chairs, etc.  Not only will the employee appreciate the generosity, but it will probably make them more productive anyway. They'll also have incentive to stick around since they know going somewhere else will likely mean a step backwards in terms of work environment.

Also, pay attention to the spouses/partners. They're just as affected by the long hours and lack of security so you can make everyone happier by giving them some perks, including having things done for them that are probably being neglected by the employee, e.g. car washes, house cleaning, etc.

On the other hand, some people would just rather have the cash. Make sure you know which ones.

**I reckon the easiest one would be to create an environment where office feels like home.** 

*A real home.*     

Forget about office chairs and desks. Just make your office like a house. Put a fridge (fill it in with foods too if possible), a tv, a couch, a bed (just in case they get stressed and need to take a nap), or even a laundry machine(?). That actually can make people stay and work better at the office because they are feeling comfortable at the office. Make an office their second home.

This may be starting to get a bit off topic but I found this to be a great video on employee motivation: [Ted Talk:  Dan Pink on the surprising science of motivation](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html)

Dan Pink talking about three key factors:  Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose

I think he summarizes it quite well.  Individuals want the flexibility in their work, they want to master it and know that it matters, and I'd add work with a great team.

In the vein on this specific question, I'd also add that many of the responses can be summarized as "don't sweat the small stuff" and "remove the roadblocks".  Basically treat people well and let them do what they need to do to be productive and when you see anything that is impeding their progress get it out of their way.  I think the specifics are going to vary according to the team you have and you have to work with them to understand what is going to be the most helpful in your situation.

In no particular order, here are some of my favorites. They vary in cost, and some may not be as feasible for startups, based on their size & budget

 - **Super flexibility**
 - Give them the **option to telecommute** either part- or full-time
 - **Snacks**
 - **Lunches** — whether in or out, daily or not, they really do appreciate it —
 - **Excellent coffee/tea**
 - **Tickets** to a concert, game, or movie
 - A **team building retreat or team building exercises of some kind** — they can be made fun and if it takes time out of the work day it will be seen as a perk —
 - Go to a **happy hour or networking event** (okay maybe not a perk, but it can be fun depending on the nature of the event)
 - **Gun range, fishing, sailing, golfing, canoeing, or any other outdoor activity** in your area
 - **Ice cream bar** sounds like a good idea from webclimber
 - **Beer cooler** (ala hubspot), or some other kind of happy hour like friday afternoon wine or margaritas

Giving them flexibility on their time is probably the most valued perk and will make the person glad they work for a small company.

Getting an expresso machine was also a huge company hit. We saved a ton of time by not driving to starbucks all the time (our office location required a drive). And it's a huge morale boost when the company CEO takes some time to make you a shot of expresso! (this was a startup afterall).

Cater lunch most days. (This can be a really cost effective way to save on salary since you can possibly write it off. Even if you can't, it's worth a few grand in salary to each employee... so you call it a benefit/perk)

At some stage you are going to have to ask your employees to work stupid hours and spend time away from their family. If you invite spouses / partners and children to the corporate Christmas party and  summer barbeque they will feel more involved and will feel that their sacrifices are appreciated, and if you are lucky you may even be able to enlist their help from time to time.

Lots of interesting concepts here.

I'm totally on-board with the move away from 'conventional' working hours (somebody mentioned "managing biomass" - excellent phrase!), instead focusing on what is actually important to a business....productivity!

I do feel that some of these ideas have a tendency to make a work environment resemble a creche rather than a professional business.....I guess tastes just vary....I don't have strong feelings _against_ such things, but I wouldn't choose to instigate them myself.

I also sympathize with Alex's comment on Jason's post - about company lunches seeming "cultish". I think perhaps "cultish" is not quite the right word, but even though the intention is no doubt sincere (I'm sure the folks @ FogCreek are very nice), there is a definite 'tilt' in incentive with such a policy.

You may think it says something nice about you (and it does), but think about the implications it forces upon people. If I want to go out to lunch, do I now have to be concerned about what others might think of me? Will they think that I feel "too good to eat with them"? Perhaps I should go along with the team lunches to make sure they don't think badly of me.....but now I'm altering my behavior out of a sense of apprehension rather than good nature. Your nice lunch policy has succeeded in poisoning the atmosphere to some degree.

I'm sure they have a great team of good people there, but how many people at FogCreek _do not_ choose to go out for lunch because of concerns over how that may be perceived?

Work-life balance
---

Offer flexible work hours, and be upfront about it. Many people won't ask for flexibility even though they'd want it for fear of seeming lazy. Everybody needs unplanned time off: The young developer/student has a sudden exam, the middle-aged developer needs time for the newborn (so he may want to work part-time for a year. Make that possible, if you can), etc.

Work-from-home days can be nice, but they need a lot of trust from you and a lot of discipline on the part of the employee.

Appreciation
---
Our tools are also our favourite toys. Get your devs 24" LCDs, at least. Let them choose their own mouse and keyboard, at least. It's not expensive (heck, even a 30" or two 24" are much less than a month's wage), but it shows your appreciation, and it makes them happier and more productive.

Also just show some appreciation the old-fashioned way and pat them on the back from time to time (or just tell them how much you appreciate their work).

Small gestures like cool business cards might also work.

Treat them to a nice restaurant every now and then.

Involvement
---
Involve them in decisions, or at least inform them and let them give their opinion. Also involve them into the state of things: How sales are going, how you talked to somebody at Microsoft, and they're now using your product - and don't leave out the problems. Make your employees feel part of something they're interested in.

Growth
---
Buy your employees books about programming topics they're interested in (and that have a connection to what you're doing). I know I appreciate just being able to tell my boss "I want to learn about user interface design", and he just tells me to mail him a list of amazon links.

Startups implicitely work on new projects, using new tools; for many people, this is a huge benefit, compared to "maintain an decade-old VB5 application". Just make sure your people know and appreciate the difference.

Having great people in your team motivates other great people to do the same, because it's more fun than working with morons.

The absence of micromanagement - get your job done, but don't have to report for every single minute what exactly was accomplished then - also attracts the right kind of people.

Foosball tables, dartboards etc. are cheap, but of course people must be allowed to use them whenever they feel like it. The worst thing you could do is have such stuff, but only allow using it from 12:00-12:30.

I work for a mid sized company, but our CIO has autonomy to run his department how he sees fit. The backing of the CFO is so that, he has cash to give us some great unofficial benefits.

1. The all important and wonderful flex time.  As a few others said "were adults, leave us alone"
2. We don't get regular lunches, but 4-5 times a year our whole department (probably 20 people total including support) get treated to a lavish lunch of some sort.  Sometimes we take over a nice restaurant, last one was Brazillian barbecue, or have high quality catering brought in.  These lunches take a couple hours and we all just hang out and have fun, getting paid of course, even our hourly people.  Plus a few times a year the individual teams within the department go out to lunch on the company's dime.
3. We celebrate pirate day.  Some of the department dress up like pirates and we have a huge catered lunch and we give prizes for the best pirate name.  Last year I won $100 in itunes gift cards.  This may sound *dorky and hokey* to some people, but it grew organically out of our department's own ideas and by and large, technical people are dorky so it fits :)
4. Game day.  This is fantastic, every year for one work day between Christmas day and new years, we all come in to work but we play games together all day and are fed breakfast and lunch.  This is like a lan-party at work using our company's uber network and servers.  The morale boosting power of this one day cannot be overstated.  We talk about it for months in advance and for months afterwards.  All it costs is 1 day of pay and our entire department is giddy with excitement.  It's genius.

These are just a few of the perks I can think of, but they are the most "obvious".  Basically I see it as our CIO knows his people, and has created things tailor made just for them.  Creative benefits are not universal.  I doubt a department full of accountants would be all that thrilled with game day :) but we LOVE IT! 

Finally, nothing can replace a good boss.  This one is tricky, though, because a good boss means something different to each employee.

Forgot to mention one thing.  Get rid of under performers immediately.  Few things aggravate a good employee more than a bad employee.

The one thing I would add is silly awards and traditions. These create an esprit de corps that transcends physical perks. We have a couple:

 - **Pay the Pig:** Anytime someone does something "dickish" or complains a lot, they have to pay the piggy bank a small fine. Once the bank is full, the whole group does something fun.
 - **The Geeky Tiki:** If someone does a stellar job, they get the Geeky Tiki award. It's a medal and a Tee Shirt. This is kind of a random thing that the boss (me) gets to award.

On the lunch thing, you underestimate the pressure to attend on those who have other obligations or who have a life outside of work. And on the unmetered PTO thing, the pressure is likely to take small vacations, if at all - in my experience (observing from outside as I've not been in that environment yet), people rarely take as much PTO as they would in a situation in which it was accounted for - due to peer pressure or the fact that there just never, gosh darn it, seems to be a good enough time for 2 weeks off.

Set some limits (maybe $$?), but let them tell you what they want. I don't find things being the same for everyone as equal, fair, etc. Maybe on a regular basis, everyone can pick from a list, a "Get out of Jail Free" card. Instead of getting to leave early on Friday, I may choose to have one extra vacation day. We often jump the gun and think people will take advantage of this and work the system, but that is because so many companies are not taking your approach by wanting to do something good for the employees. Don't offer me a cupcake and then stick your finger in the icing before handing it to me.

You asked for cheap, and the answer is surprising, at least to me: it may be that the most important hire is your least expensive hire.  The best places I've worked had one employee that the less than the best did not: an outstanding HR person.  This is probably the lowest paid professional in the entire startup or small company and yet it's the person who makes the technical folks most excited about work in general.  Technical folks are often poor at planning group activities or seeing the utility of them.  However, a single great HR hire pays massive dividends in employees' enthusiasm and the company's responsiveness.  If given 20 great technical people and no "culture" person (say, just some random admin person) versus 19 technical folks and 1 great culture person, I'd choose the latter.  I might gain the productivity equivalent of 2-5 more people in the process.

I realize that this isn't a standard "fringe benefit", but it's great to have coworkers who are having fun.  The great "culture" person will put together events, such as birthday celebrations, movie outings, and more, plus keep the management considerate of employees who have personal issues to attend to, such as funerals, sick relatives, etc.  For instance, when an employee has a death in the family, a considerate company will be sure that flowers are sent to the funeral.  Trust me, an employee will never forget that consideration.  So, treat your people well, and hire people that know how to do that.

Disclaimer: I'm not an HR person, I'm in the technical crowd.

First, never assume that as startup it ok not to offer market-rate salaries to our employees. If you go that way you will never recruit the team you need to succeed. Remember, execution is the key to success. 

Second, just introduce perks based on what your team wants. You don't need to ask on internet about that.

A flexible working schedule and nothing else.
Pay them enough they can afford what they want (gym card, car, whatever).

Would you think that a chess player will be happy with your gym card?
Or that a bike racer will fall for your BMW?

More than snacks, lunch. It's not as expensive as it sounds (people don't expect sushi), you can leave Friday out of it (Fridays everyone goes to lunch out), and bringing lunch in actually cuts a lot of wasted time out of the day without anyone feeling like they're working more.
