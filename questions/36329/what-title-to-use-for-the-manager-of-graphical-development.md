The lead of technical development is also known as CTO. What's the counterpart that leads the graphical development? Does this position have a commonly-used title or not?

Graphic design managers are rarely C-level people in product companies (except for the entertainment industry). The title is usually either Art Director or Chief Creative Officer.

You could use one of the titles in this hierarchy:

Lead -> Manager -> Director -> Vice President -> President

Each of these titles (except for president) is also sometimes preceded by "Senior", depending on experience level and influence.

I would say graphics designer as normal graphics designer, and for lead or manager of these designers i would go for - Principal Graphic Designer - as they are leading the pack by example - this are the norm title in EU.

I'd say Chief Creative Office, however Chief Graphics Officer is in use, too.
