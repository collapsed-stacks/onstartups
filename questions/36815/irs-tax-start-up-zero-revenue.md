I am doing taxes for someone who had about $1,500 in 2011 expenses for a new business (sole-proprietorship) but no income. Can she deduct these start-up costs in 2011 or will she have to add them to 2012 taxes even though the expenses were in 2011. The IRS regs say "int the year the business begins" but I am not sure if that means first year with revenue.

The business begins when the business is incorporated.  Business may have investments for which they do research and pay salaries and only after the product is ready revenues may begin.  That is how my accountant explain it to me.

Does it really matter?  You will either pay less taxes this year, or next year.  I would rather have the money now.  We are not talking about a large sum of money.  It will save them ~$500-600 on their tax bill.
