<p>I see various sites which ask for donations which look to be for profit. When I looked at PayPal's website their donate button seems to be specific for non-profit organizations.</p>

<p>The reason I ask is I want to start some online websites which are educational and if people find them worthwhile, then they can contribute/donate money to me. I know I'll have to report the money as income, however I'm curious if there is an easy standard out there for receiving donations for profit.</p>

<p>I can't help you with your PayPal dilemma but there's something you should know: <strong>donations do not work</strong>.</p>

<p>You can't expect to make any significant amount of money through donations (i.e. voluntary payment where the payer doesn't get anything in return other than a good feeling).</p>

<p>This is based on my personal experience and experiences of many other people that I've read.</p>

<p>As to your question: PayPal does have something called donations for Personal Fundrasing (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/fundraising" rel="nofollow">https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/fundraising</a>) so if you can frame those donations as fundrasing towards keeping your website running, it might qualify. That being said, I can't find a clear explanation of what qualifies as "Personal Fundraising" so you probably would still run a risk of having your account closed by PayPal.</p>

<p>But it's mostly academic: even if people find your website useful, an astonishingly small number of people will donate. Based on my experience, we're talking 1 out of 10000 people.</p>

<p>If you think that you can create something unique that has some value to someone, it's much better to charge for it.</p>

<p>It's even better make money via ads (AdSense if it's a website with decent amount of traffic) than via donations.</p>

<p>you would basically do it like you would sell a product. Since there is no tax benefit, that's more or less what you are doing. Just make something saying donate here, or help support this site and link to a paypal sale form.</p>
