I am in the process of trying to convince my boss to have catered lunches at work. The company is still in its scrappy startup phase so money is a little tight. I was wondering if anyone could point me to any studies or articles on the beneficent of free lunch at work, and if anyone could talk about if free lunches are a worthwhile perk for a small software company where the money is still a little tight.

<p>Joel Spolsky has a few good articles on the importance of employees eating together. <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/04/28.html" rel="nofollow">Here's one of them</a>. </p>

You might want to look at some studies in organizational behaviors.

I am not sure what book is available to you. Look for the chapter of "motivation".
Three theories are worth studying:

- Expectancy theory
- Incentive theory
- Equity theory

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_studies#Theories_and_models

However, the literature does not answer your question directly. You have to apply the theory to your culture, context, company structure, etc.

Ask yourself these questions:

- Is company paid lunch a norm at where you live?
- Does free lunch help retaining key employees for company?
- What does your competitor do?
- Does it affect your company's profit margin?

At where I am(Canada), free lunch is very rare in small companies. Even in fast food restaurants, some require employee pay 1/2 price for food.
