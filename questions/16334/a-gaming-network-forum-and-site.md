I am currently in the process of creating a gaming network, but there are 2 things I'm wondering about.

If I were to run multiple games, is it generally a good idea to give every game it's own seperate forum, each managed by an administrator? -or is it better to create sub-forums, and just keep all of the forums on one, long page?

Also, about the website. Do you think the websites should keep the same lay-out when released under the same network name?

Thank you for your time, any response is very much apreciated.

<p>This question is quite subjective, so it's not very easy to answer. In the end it's really up to you.</p>

<p>I suggest you check out other game / game forum sites for your research and maybe post some questions to ask its members.</p>

<p>Also branding is important even if you do different sites and same lay-out is important for usability.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fizzy.com" rel="nofollow">Fizzy</a> is a great example, they are an Australian startup that has been running for a few years and they are doing quite well. Their key selling points are: </p>

<ul>
<li>A solid fan base of people who are loyal to the site</li>
<li>Good branding and easy to use site</li>
<li>Unobtrusive advertising</li>
</ul>

<p>I've met the guys and they are passionate about what they do, I think this is the key. They actually want to make a better gaming experience, not just another game site.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
