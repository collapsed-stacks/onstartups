I am the sole owner of an S corp and I am the only employee. If I make $100,000/year and I pay myself $50,000 as a salary and the other $50,000 as distribution. How much income tax do I have to pay on the distribution portion? 

Can any one point me to a source that tells me what the tax rate is for s corp distribution for 2012?

There's no tax on S-Corp distributions. There's tax on **your** income. It is called "ordinary income" and is taxed at **your** marginal tax rate. There's no difference between the first 50K you got as salary and the second 50K you got as distribution in that respect - they're both taxed at your ordinary income rates. The salary portion is *also* subject to the payroll (FICA) taxes.
