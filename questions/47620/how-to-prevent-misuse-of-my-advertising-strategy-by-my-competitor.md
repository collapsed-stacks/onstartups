You can't. You should assume that they can and will mimic anything you make public that shows any success.

It's the things behind the scenes like who you target, what information you collect/use, and the overall strategy that needs to be your secret sauce. If you can hide the success then they won't even know what to mimic. ;)

And you should do the same. Occasionally (not everyday), look to see what they're doing and if it fits your strategy or how you can do it better, etc.
