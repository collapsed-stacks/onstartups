I am looking for inspiring stories of startups where the employees who got ESOPS in the beginning  made millions when the company became successful. For example, Infosys is well known example. Any other that I can rely upon ? Any references-details about such stories would help.

Dell and Google I know for certain.

Any Fortune-100 tech company has a good chance of being an example too.

P.S. In general it is an *extreme exception* that people get so rich off ESOPs that they never have to work again.
