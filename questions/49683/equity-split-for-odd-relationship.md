I am developing a SaaS platform by bootstrapping with sweat equity while covering the bills with a full time job. I am probably 2-3 months away from launching a viable public beta, and to this point I have done all of the business development, strategic planning, logistics, software engineering and design on my own.

Early on I identified an ideal brand to use with the service, which happened to be an empty parked page. The valuation of this domain is in the $40-70k range and I am not able to purchase it outright. I developed a relationship with the owner of the domain and we're both on the same page as to what we'd like to do with it.

We both bring great business networks to the table, so I'm reduced to comparing all my time and efforts creating this platform to his brand asset.

What is an advisable structuring for this situation?

New corp with equity split between our own companies? What split would be fair? Would the new corp acquire ownership of the brand asset? Of the software IP?

A domain lease/license agreement? What would be fair compensation to the domain owner?

A straightforward way to handle this would be as follows:

# Step 1 #
Figure out your founders share split, based on what each of you is bringing to the table (without the name). There's lots on here about that. Make sure you include four-year vesting in your shares if you're full time and ten-year vesting if you are part time (must be on here, or Google 'VentureLynx vesting' where I wrote on it).

# Step 2 #
Figure out the value of your company for angel investment. There must be lots written on here already on valuing your startup. It's probably somewhere in the $200-800K range. Maybe closer to $200K.

# Step 3 #
Pay for the brand with shares, which vest immediately.

How does this play out over time?

Initially, you 'own', e.g., $150K worth of shares vesting over 10 years (until you leave your day job and work full time when they vest over 4 years); the other person owns $50K worth of shares vesting over 10 years and $40-70K worth of vested shares. Don't focus on the headline number. Look at the magic of vesting:

 1. If you leave after one year part time, you keep $15K of shares, they keep $45-75K worth of shares, and it's their company with you owning a tiny piece

 2. If you stay two years full time and one year part time, you own $90K of shares, and they own $55-90K worth of shares. It's now your company.

Figure out the numbers that work for you/them. Which effectively comes down to: Who will do how much work in the business, and how much is the business worth without the name?
