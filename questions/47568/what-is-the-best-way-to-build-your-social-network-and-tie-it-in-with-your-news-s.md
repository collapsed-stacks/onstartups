I have a news site that I will be launching this summer and would like to use Twitter and Facebook to drive traffic to the site. However, I'm very particular about who I friend/follow on those sites. How can I be selective with the people I connect to and still build my audience on my news site?

Create separate social accounts for your news site - otherwise your personal "filters" will conflict with your desire to create an audience.
