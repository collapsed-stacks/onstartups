## Do any services provide email management to allow a limited number of 'shareable' invites? Or are there alternatives to that system out there?

Here is the backstory - we are launching a service in the next few weeks, but wish to invite a limited number of contacts initially.  A major part of the plan is to allow these contacts to invite (provide free licenses) to a limited number of contacts - probably 3.  We want to do this to:

A. limit our initial quiet launch/ soft beta so we can monitor our backend for issues

B. create some scarcity, leading to built up demand

C. gain momentum from that scarcity as we confirm we can scale, and roll into an open beta with more invites available

Any input or advice will be helpful, as we are roughly 3 weeks away from this 'soft launch' with our official launch roughly 3 weeks following.  

Thanks much!!

Create a url that has a conditional statement in it connected to your signup database.  Once your signups hit the limit then display a different message on the signup page saying that the number of signups have been hit.  Then maybe show a different form to be notified when it opens up.
