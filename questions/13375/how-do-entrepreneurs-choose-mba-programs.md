I am crowdsourcing some market research on two topics:

1) What attributes are considered by entrepreneurs when deciding which MBA programs to apply to and ultimately attend?

2) Describe some creative ways that MBA programs could implement these attributes.

Look forward to hearing your thoughts here or <a href="http://whinot.com/web/open-projects/mba-market-research/crowdsource">on the Whinot platform where the top 12 responses will be paid $50 each.</a>

You have to first <a href="http://whinot.com/web/guest/registration">register</a> to participate.

Obviously what you learn is important, but the biggest benefit of the top programs is making connections and the credentials themselves. Many people with domain expertise have a difficult time finding technical partners and vice-versa (Common type of question on this site.). You'll also get an idea of who wants to start something on their own and who is looking for a corporate job. Once you're in the work world, fewer people are vocal about wanting to leave and start their own company.

It's easier to talk someone into taking on the risk of a startup when they can fit everything they own into the back seat of their car, lived on ramen noodles and shared an appartment with 5 other people for a few years.

Ways to help:

 1. have a track record of successful
    alums
 2. provide opportunities to build &
    test business ideas and not just
    rely on theory
 3. offer inexpensive access to
    technical infrastructure like:
    servers, site hosting, software
    license discounts, etc.
 4. introduce graduates to funding

Tim's facetious comment is largely true (+1), but there are some interesting MBA programs that really are entrepreneurial.

For example, in Austin there's Actin, a one-year super-intensive school where all the teachers have already been successful entrepreneurs (academic credit doesn't count) and they have a rigorous process of keeping instruction quality high through student surveys.  The people I know who have gone through that program have an advantage.  No, not so much of an advantage that others cannot compete or something, but certainly wasn't a waste of time.

Still, that's few and far between...

Nevertheless, the number of Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and similar MBAs who go on to found companies is pretty substantial.  Whether or not the schooling was a cause or correlation is up for debate, but it's hard to say it hurt.  Except the wallet.  :-)
