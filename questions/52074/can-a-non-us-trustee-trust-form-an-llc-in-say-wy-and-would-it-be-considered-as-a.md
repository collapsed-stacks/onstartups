<p>A real-world trust that's not in a tax haven wishes to from a MM LLC in the US without any additional members and elect to be regarded by the IRS as a partnership. Can that work?</p>

<p>Trust is a single entity. It cannot be a partnership of its own,  you have to have multiple entities (at least two) to become a partnership.</p>
