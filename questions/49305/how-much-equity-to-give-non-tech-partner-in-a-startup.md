## How much equity to give non-tech partner in a startup?

I have a startup idea I'm working on. I came up with the idea and will be coding it from the ground up and basically doing all of the work. However, the startup would be operating in a legal arena and I'll need the help of an attorney to guide development decisions, provide legal information for the site, etc. Their role would be more in just guiding site creating, workflows, etc. and providing legal information as needed. 

This need is ongoing as information within the field changes from time to time. I was thinking of giving an equity position to an attorney in exchange for their ongoing work (vested over a few years). I was thinking in the neighborhood of 5%. Does this sound reasonable? I'm not sure how any of this works as far as "etiquette" goes as this is my first startup venture.

Are there any other, better approaches to this sort of situation?
