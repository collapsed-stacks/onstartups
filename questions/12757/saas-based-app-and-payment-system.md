Get a merchant account and accept credit cards. Country of origin shouldn't be an issue. I can't imagine PayPal being limited either (I called their toll free number; India should not be a problem.).

Use 
 
 - recurly.com or 
 - chargify.com 

To handle your recurring payments. They can connect with most major merchant accounts. So whether it's PayPal, Authorize.net or whatever is popular in your area.

Getting a merchant account with normal rates to accept US$ is nearly impossible for a foreign entity or individual. I suggest paypal only as a solutions, just paypal business with entity based in India (you will not get Pro -merchant- account).
