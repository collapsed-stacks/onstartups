My product is in development.
By Feb 5th a beta should be released.
For the mean time aside from getting traffic to prelaunch what else should I do ?

I am the nontech founder.

So Far I have completed :

Business Presentation
Executive Summary
and Had a video released of how to work

What steps would be next?

Thanks for all the help.

Get as many people to the prelaunch page as possible so you have an audience to launch beta to.

Help build supporting documentation to help people in the beta (set up a knowledge base or wiki with helpful information).

Make sure your support channels are organised and you have a way of handling support tickets.

Refine the messaging on your prelaunch page (a/b tests)

Mostly though, just get people to do the beta, as a non-tech founder thats the most useful thing you could do right now.
