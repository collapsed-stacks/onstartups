Has anyone had any experience using UK startup [GoCardless][1] for only payment processing?

> Get paid directly from your customersâ€™ bank accounts. No merchant account. No credit card fees. No hassle.

They take 1% of a transaction which seems pretty reasonable but I thought I'd check to see if anyone had used them before I delve any deeper.

We use Gocardless.  Payment is taken from clients bank account, just like a direct debit so you have to know the amount in advance.  Can also be used for regular payment direct debit.  Very low costs and hassle factor

I used this service whilst travelling, they do not tell you that once they have your funds you do not get them until you explain to them what you want the funds for and you have to provide them copies of your passport ect which really they should do at the start as now I have no way to access my money until I can get my passport scanned which is a bit annoying whilst travelling.
