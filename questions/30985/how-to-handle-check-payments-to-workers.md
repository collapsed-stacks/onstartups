On my site, users earn virtual currency, which can be converted to cash payment. Is there a service that can facilitate in sending out cheques, paypal, or wire payments to the users?

I don't want to have to send out checks from my personal banking account.

You might look for companies that process rebates.  They have the means available to mail checks after people jump thru hoops.  You could just make the hoops less of a hassle and they could still mail the checks.

What you are probably looking for is something like ACH or EFT. You can setup a business bank account and have your payments sent from that account.
