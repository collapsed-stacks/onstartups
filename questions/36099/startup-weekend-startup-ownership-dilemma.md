<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

So, we (me and my team) just won a local startup weekend event. Now, we obviously want to turn this product into a company. The product is a webapp at the moment which will be turned into mobile apps as we go on. We have 9 people on our team; a basic description would be 4 Marketing & Biz people, 2 Developers, 2 UI designers, 1 Graphic Designer.

**What would be a good way to decide ownership?** Obviously, some team members put in more/quality effort than others this weekend and some will put in more/quality efforts in the post-startup weekend timeline. 

Suggestions and ideas will be appreciated :)

Cheers.
