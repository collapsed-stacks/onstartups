We have a startup with some interested investors - (friends, family, etc).  We have a C - Corp structure.  We want to take in some of these investments - problem is that we have spoken to 2 lawyers and we haven't been able to get a clear answer how to structure it.  I.E. What exactly to we give the investors, Stock purchase agreement etc...

We are a 3 person team all with equal shares.  We have a prototype product, but we need the capital to finish it up, programming, graphics, marketing etc...

Can anyone offer insight on how to take in these investments as a C-Corp.  I am talking investments totaling approximately 2 to 300k from multiple investors (probably no more than 10 total, but possibly more).

Thank you kindly for any insight.
