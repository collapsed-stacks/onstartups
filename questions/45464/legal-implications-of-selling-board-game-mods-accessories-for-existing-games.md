I am looking to create, manufacture and sell modifications for existing board games that other people have made.

Purely as an example: I might create a new set of tokens to be used with the "Monopoly" board game, or I might create an alternate rule set for "Settlers of Catan".

Obviously the creators of Monopoly own the copyright to the artwork of their game, descriptions, wording of their rules etc.

1) Is there any reason why I couldn't sell a modifcation that is "for use with Monopoly", using my own artwork for the pieces.  I'm only saying it is for use with the Monopoly board game, not actually using their copyright material.

2) Would I be able to say "for use with Monopoly", since "Monopoly" is probably a trademark etc.

The modification industry is actually a pretty big world, people sell modified parts for cars (down to specific makes & models), new phone covers and things like that ("Phone cover to suit iPhone4") etc.  So is this really any different?

Thanks for any preliminary advice (obviously I will check with a Lawyer for final clarification).

Should be fine, so long as you don't make any suggestion that your products are made by or connected to the trademark owners'. You should probably also have some kind of small print saying "Monopoly is (registered) trademark of XXX" too, I guess. All that said, regardless of legality people can be kind of funny with trademarks so you're probably going to get a lawyer's letter at some point.
