I've noticed a trade-off in survey and e-sign tools.  

Survey tool:

  * Low cost for large volumes

  * Manage Survey Workflow well

  * Excellent data collection / reporting

  * Does not offer signature

  * Does not offer paper trail

e-Sign tools:

  * Cost more for large volumes

  * Worfklow management more manual

  * Reporting may require enterprise accounts

  * Offer awesome paper trail

  * Offers awesome signature

What I really want is a Ballot tool.  (Something that surveys and has a good paper signature feel)

So far I've found:

 * http://surveygizmo.com - best survey workflow with login/password authentication

 * http://polldaddy.com - best user interface for basic polls

 * http://surveymonkey.com - not being considered

 * http://rightsignature.com - Excellent paper trail.  Excellent end user experience.  Expensive reporting.  Manual workflow.  Expensive for high volume.

 * http://docusign.com - Excellent paper trail.  Expensive for high volume.  Better workflow then right signature.

Any feedback would be great!

<p>I've used <a href="http://heliosvoting.org/" rel="nofollow">Helios Voting</a> and found it to be pretty good. </p>

<p>We used this for an informal group of privacy advocates to drive a campaign across Twitter earlier this year and it was easy and effective. </p>

I used to work there 18 months ago

Just a thought Groupon started out as a political/activist petition tool..

I don't know what you mean with paper trail and signature; but limesurvey is fantastic. I use it for my daytime profits.

there is even a hostet solution - but install you own is free (if you have a server that can handle the load and you can customize the shit out of it, if you want).
