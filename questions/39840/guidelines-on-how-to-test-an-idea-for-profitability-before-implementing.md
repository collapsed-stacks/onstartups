Surely you've heard of Ramit Sethi (this guy: http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/ ).  In one of his courses, he teaches how to model an idea and test it for profitability before implementing it.  I'm pretty sure there's nothing new under the sun, and that some entrepreneurs somewhere have done this before.  Can anyone provide me with a bullet point list, outlining the steps you would take to model a given idea and test it for profitability?

Thanks

This is a complicated question, but a couple of solid resources are "The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries, "Running Lean" by Ash Maurya, and "The 4 Steps To The Epiphany" By Steve Blank. All those books discuss tactics and strategies on how to discover what your market wants, create an initial product/service offering, validating and iterating on your offering, price testing, etc.

Another way to get market information, including a rough gauge on profitability of a market or even product/service offering, is to use Google Keyword tool, which lets you research keywords used in searches, along with how many people searched for each keyword (i.e., market size), competition for each keyword, and Adwords cost (which gives you a guesstimate on how profitable the market is). There are also automated tools (e.g., Market Samurai) which do some of the same things, plus additional features.

It's really quite simple to talk about:

 - Find a problem. Talk to the potential customers. 
 - Understand the problem better than they do. 
 - Find a solution. 
 - Ask the potential customers if the solution fixes their problem and whether they would pay for it. 
 - If no - start again. 
 - If yes - build a prototype/mvp and deliver to customers for testing. 
 - Get feedback, iterate, release - ad infinatum.

but much harder to do.
