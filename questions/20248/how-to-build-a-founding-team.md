I am working on a startup idea, and currently I am taking it solo. I would very much like to have 1-2 other people to work on it with me. I am a programmer, and I would like a 2nd programmer, and maybe a business type person as well. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to find people to be co-founders?

It's a very difficult question infact :) You can try these things:

1) Interact with lots and lots of people in the market.

2) Go to barcamp, and other seminars where you can interact with lots of other like-minded people.

3) Look in your network. See if anybody is interested in your idea or product and explain the benifits to them. 

For every startup the most important thing is to market yourself, and make sure that you don't forget your friends. Also, participate in many startup seminars, like barcamp.

<p>If you are an iPhone/iPad/Mac developer, then consider attending <a href="http://nscodernight.com/" rel="nofollow">NSCoder Night</a>. It's on weekly basis in the larger cities around the world. In Denmark there is a <a href="http://copenhagencocoa.com/" rel="nofollow">NSCoder Night in Copenhagen</a> every Wednesday and between 4 and 8 people show up. Dunno if there is a NSCoder Night in Israel. It's a great way to get a network.  </p>

<p>You could try <a href="http://www.techcofounder.com/" rel="nofollow">TechCofounder</a>? I've never used it personally but it looks like an interesting website.</p>

<p>In Silicon Valley and Austin, I organize the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Co-Founders-Wanted-Meetup/" rel="nofollow">Co-Founders Meetup</a>.</p>

<p>I also just launched <a href="http://letslunch.com" rel="nofollow">LetsLunch.</a>com, which forces you to go out and meet other entrepreneurs over lunch. So far it's been a huge success.</p>

<p>Bottom line: meet as many people as you can, and don't be shy to talk about what you are working on. If you don't tell me, then how will I ever know? It could be of interest to me.</p>
