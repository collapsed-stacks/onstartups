We are still in the early stage of a company doing seo syndication tool and I would like your opinions to a fair distribution of equity. Here is our situation: 

**Founder 1**

- Will be the CEO and coder
- Come up with the idea
- Have coded a working prototype
- 100% committed to the project since 5 months
- Invest $100,000

**Founder 2**

- Will be the CTO
- Now coding with founder 1
- Works now as a paid freelancer for founder 1
- 65% committed since 1 month, will be 85% in a week or so
- Invest $0

**Founder 3**

- Will be the CMO
- Now doing marketing/seo/sales stuff for the company
- Works now for free for founder 1
- 25% committed since 1 month and a half, just quit, will be 100% in a week or so
- Invest $0

Assuming nobody will take salaries, What will be a fair distribution of equity?
