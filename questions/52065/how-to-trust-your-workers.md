<p>Like most businesses and companies, they have workers like e.g. shopkeepers, managers etc. I was thinking of opening a business but obviously it's quite stressful and money wise quite hard. And as a beginner I don't have a lot of knowledge of opening a business and I have been studying and reading a lot of articles but there are so many aspects. </p>

<p>Anyway, for example if open a Clothes Shop in town and I hire a cashier, how do I know that the worker won't secretly take some of the money and put it in their pockets as cash? I know I could just be the cashier as well as manager myself but what if I open another same shop (an example) and I can't be at two places at once? How do I know that they won't steal some money or steal some products without me knowing? I mean, looking at successful companies, I don't really think a cashier or a worker would do that. </p>

<p>I know there's CCTV but what if I don't have all the time looking at the CCTV, does that mean I would have to hire a CCTV operative too? How do companies trust their workers?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hire the right people - it is not foolproof, of course, but it is the single thing which will make the biggest difference.</p>

<p>Additionally, a good POS and stock control system can help too as if they are taking money or not ringing goods through etc then you will get some warning of this which will allow you to decide what to do next.</p>
