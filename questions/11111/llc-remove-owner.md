Assume an LLC has 2 owners, each at 50%.  The owners mutually agree that one will take 100% ownership to switch the LLC to a disregarded entity, and the other owner will be dropped off completely.

What is the filing process for doing this?

First, this agreement (member withdrawal) needs to be in writing and in the form of a resolution. Both owners obviously must sign the resolution.

You can then file a [Form 8832](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf), which will allow you to pay the LLC's taxes (if any) on your Schedule C.

It is a good idea to put information in your operating agreement regarding the removal of partners.

Combining the other responses here, you should pass a resolution in writing signed by both members and integrate the details of this procedure as a standard part of your operating agreement for any future changes in ownership.
