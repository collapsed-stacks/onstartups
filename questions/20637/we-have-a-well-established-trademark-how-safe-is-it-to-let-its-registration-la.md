## We have a well-established trademark - how safe is it to let its registration lapse?

I work for a company called New Internationalist ( http://www.newint.org/ ). We've been trading under that name since 1973, and have a registered trademark for the name which has recently lapsed. The company who registered the trademark want $1,000 to renew (I've since found there are cheaper firms). But I've been trying to persuade my colleagues that having a trademark with such a long trading history gives us all the protection we need without paying for a registered one any more. Can anyone comment a to whether I'm right, and how safe we would be without a *registered* trademark?

<p>@ $100 to renew your trademark directly @ <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/maintain/prfaq.jsp" rel="nofollow">uspto</a> , why would you put it at risk?</p>
