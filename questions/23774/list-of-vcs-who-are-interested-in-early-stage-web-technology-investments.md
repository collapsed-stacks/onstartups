There are some VC funds who only invest in late-stage companies and some who focus on early stage

I am trying to find (or build) a list of those who are interested in taking part in **early-stage** investments.

I've searched but cannot find anything up to date.

This is why I have found so far:

 - http://www.businessinsider.com/venture-capital-firms
 - http://leverageacademy.com/blog/top-100-venture-capital-firms/
 - http://www.scribd.com/doc/3698959/List-of-Angel-Investor-Groups-and-Early-Stage-Venture-Capital-Firms

These are all great, but are several years old and may be out dated.  Anyone know of an up to date list?

**Edit:**  
I am talking primarily about companies interested in investing in web technologies.

<p>Rather than approaching a long list of them individually, I recommend you instead work on honing your pitch deck, then get signed up on <a href="http://angel.co" rel="nofollow">AngelList</a>. </p>

<p>It has a mix of Angels and VC firms that are interested in seed rounds. It's a self-selecting group and it has worked very well for us.</p>

I've been struggling as well with "where to start". There are so many different funds and angels, groups and individuals, I'm trying to figure out how to actually start narrowing down my scope so I have a few to talk with.
