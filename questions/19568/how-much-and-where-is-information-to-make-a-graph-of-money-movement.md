I'm interested in compiling data about where money is moving -- essentially what businesses are paying other businesses and for what.  This is to make a product that analyzes this data and helps users make informed decisions about the consequences of their spending.  However, I have a background in mathematics, not business, so my questions are as follows:

* Is there already such a data compilation somewhere?  Perhaps multiple to be aggregated?
* How much of such information is required by law to be public (if any).  How much is usually available?
* If there is a decent amount available, how does one go about finding it?

I know this is a very general question.  I think a unified data source could potentially be very important, but I don't even know to what extent it is possible, or where to start if so.  Any information at all would be helpful. Thanks.

In the U.S.-

 1. This data does not exist
 2. It is not required by law
 3. No US company would want you to have access to their data

At least some U.S. companies would consider thid data to be a trade secret and sue you if you published it.
