I currently run a travel service that is an S corporation. I will be launching a new online business in the summer that will feature coupons for my local community. 

Do I need to file for an LLC for this new business? Can I just run it as another division of my current travel company?

Maybe an attorney or accountant can correct me, but I think that it doesn't matter which you do.

Running a second LLC will mean that you have to do all of the same reporting to the IRS and local government twice, have to keep two sets of books, etc.

Making it a division of your existing company means that you will have more complicated accounting if you want to track the profitability of both ventures.

In the end, it just matters what makes more sense to you.  I don't think there are any legal requirements either way, but I want be sure to say I am neither and attorney nor a CPA.  Just a guy who has started a few companies.

Yes, you can run the new business under your existing corporation (assuming there is nothing in the articles of incorporation that precludes the new business).

Whether you *should* do so is a business / accounting / tax, rather than legal, issue.

<p>From <a href="http://www.llcsexplained.com/should-I-put-each-business-into-its-own-LLC.htm" rel="nofollow">llcsexplained.com</a> (a great resource that I have no connection to):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without holding each business interest
  in a separate LLC, in a worst-case
  scenario the entrepreneur may lose all
  three of his businesses if something
  bad happens to any one of the
  businesses.</p>
