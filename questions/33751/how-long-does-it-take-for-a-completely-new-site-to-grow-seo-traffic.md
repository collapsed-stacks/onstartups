I have a site that is just under 3 months old: http://www.problemio.com 

Lets say that I am doing a very nice amount of SEO for it considering that it is so young. But the problem is that I don't see any bump in search traffic.

Any idea how long it should take and what is the process for new sites?

Thanks!

I do not actually have an idea about the current trends. But It generally used to be atleast 6  months to 1 year with a continuous incremental content addition along with regular link building.

I believe your site is something which "requires" content to be user generated. Just a plain SEO is not going to help (though it is necessary). 

Also your site is not something which people will search on. For example if I am a regular guy, I would not be searching on politics or problems. So I think your site may not be searched and found by users.

Rather if I were you, I would try and do a lot of passive marketing. Some way of letting people know like press releases, trying some slots in radio or TV shows to popularize the concept. There could be a lot more ways, but if some thing like that works out and if people like your concept, it could become popular like twitter or facebook etc., and people will come to your site on a daily basis.

That was just my opinion. May be some other experts will throw more light.

@Genadinik -  I visited your website. It lack SEO. 

Try to optimize your urls, there is no title given to the qna's. 

Try to find niche which are in trend or have a long shelf life. 

long shelf life examples : In health : **How to loose weight?**

Such type of question will not see a decline.

well i have no idea about SEO. But one thing I wanted to tell you. I just bumped onto this question and visited your site. And just below the headline it says:

> **Be The Change You Want To See In The World" - Mahatma Ghandi**

Well it **is not Ghandi**, it is **Gandhi** and that does not make the first impression right, at least not for me.

So my advice: fix that before any SEO thing you do.

SEO means Search Engine Optimization. And different search engines will have different algorithms to assign page ranking for your keyword. Once if you completely optimize your website for desired keyword then you have to manually submit it to search engines (This makes process faster), then search engine's spiders crawls your website and decides page ranking. Also as a human I cannot tell you in how many days you will attain top 10 ranking or not sure whether your site will get estimated ranking or not. I recommend to use IBP (Internet Business Promoter) tool which helped me in attaining 3rd place for some "x" keyword. 

Well, as said above different search engines will have different algorithms I got good place in yahoo in just 45days where as it took 3months for Google and 2 months for Bing. It completely depends upon search engine's algorithms which changes for every set of intervals. IBP too will update its product and I am 100% with it. It can take you to even 1st position in search engine. Download its trail and start working on it now.
