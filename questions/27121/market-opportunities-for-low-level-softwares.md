I'm building compilers, decompilers, assemblers, processor emulators, drivers etc. for learning purposes. Thinking to convert these immature but useful product line into a startup.

Traditional software business (like selling licenses, consultancy, etc.) seems to fit these products. But, what are the area-specific market opportunities for these softwares?

Thanks.

Considering that most platforms have already these kind of tools for free (.NET, Java, etc.) I suppose that, for you to succeed, these product line should be for a new or very niche platform such as embedded systems, robotic/domotic controllers or other specialized hardware.

I'm coming at this from a technical, but non coding background.

Software tools like Compilers, Assemblers, Emulators, etc., tend to come in complete packages, such as MS Visual Studio, or the like. Your smaller software packages may be successful if they address certain needs from parties that would be willing to invest - for instance, if you provide a special HP printer driver for Ubuntu Linux distro, people probably won't be willing to pay for it. But if you are creating a nVidia Tesla emulator, you may be able to find niches that would pay for it.

Otherwise, I really think you'll need to create complete packages to successfully market your software.

<p>Tim's great answer to <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/17332/business-models-for-a-software-component/17337#17337">Business models for a software component</a> may be an answer to this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some revenue models that I have seen:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Sell the license to the DLL for end users</li>
  <li>Give away the component and sell consulting and services</li>
  <li>Sell or give away the DLL and header files to developers and then
  they pay royalties for redistribution</li>
  <li>OEM/license the software component for others to package</li>
  <li>Sell/license the source code</li>
  </ul>
