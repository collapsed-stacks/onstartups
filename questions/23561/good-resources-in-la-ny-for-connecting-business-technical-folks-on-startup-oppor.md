I am an MBA that has worked at several startups/technology companies. What are the best resources in LA/NY to connect with like-minded technical people and explore opportunities?

Thanks!

I suggest you can lookup on meetup.com for such groups, which was exactly created to answer questions like yours at a broader level. I have successfully found several groups i was interested in using meetup. 

take a look at meetup.com and I am sure you wont be disappointed.

If, by any chance, you dont find out, you can create your own and then share it on facebook/linkedin and am sure the ball will start rolling from there. 

Good luck..!!

<p>In NY, I recommend the New York Technology Council. Website is at <a href="http://www.nytech.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytech.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Good group, good events. There were about 300 people at the last event on Analytics in the Financial Sector. </p>

<p>Helpful. </p>
