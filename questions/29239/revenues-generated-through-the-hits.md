I have a website based idea,
now i want to know how do the websites generate revenues, i now one way is the advertising, but then i heard it from someone who said that it depends on the number of hits (also mentioned google hits).

Now if someone could help me out with , how exactly does the number of hits help me make money, and how many google ads could there be on my page(i heard it from someone too).
Also where can i find the business plan of a present times website, so that i can go through it.

Any sort of help, is highly appreciated.
Any sort of description, link to other pages,or if i need to contact to some organisation for it, anything.

P.S. Kindly put more stress on the google ads and the way number of hits help me in genrating revenues.

Sorry for being a newbie,but i would really appreciate the help as this is something i would really wan to do!

Thanks.

One revenue model that you touch on is through advertising - where other sites pay you to display some sort of ad for their site or product on your site. There are several different systems of such ads, and Google ads is just one of them. Ultimately, though, you get money because people click on the ads - so the more people on your site, the more likely it is that someone will click the ad, resulting in revenue for you.

The catch is the numbers. A click might only be worth a few cents, so in order to actually make any money this way, you would need hundreds or thousands of hits. Since only a small percentage of visitors to your site will click an ad, say, 5%, that means that to get 50 clicks, you need 1000 visitors.

The best way to get this revenue model to work, therefore, is to create a site with a high volume of traffic. This in turn implies that you need to create a site that people want to go to - and that you can get attention for your site. That is, your focus needs to be on creating a good site, which, by the way, has some form of advertising on it.
