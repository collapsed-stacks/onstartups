## Would you trust time sheet reporting and approval done in the "Cloud"?

It's our belief that the world is ready to trust reporting functions to a cloud-based network (I'm not talking about simply hosted apps, but something that functions more like a LinkedIn letting you form private reporting relationships and networks). Your thoughts? Is it still too soon?

For example, staffing firms and tech service providers routinely use time sheets for client approval as well as internal functions like billing and payroll. 

Thanks in advance for your input.

I would suggest that there would be too few of these sorts of transactions for you to be able to build a relationships network.

If I am a company doing this all the time I would prefer to use a piece of software that was designed specifically for reporting rather than something like a Facebook app.

For other companies with one off transactions, why would I want to maintain a database of links to web based customers? If it's to keep track and build a relationship with the customer, then I as a business would need to keep interacting with the customer outside of the initial transaction.

Your idea is worth expanding further, but I think you need to put a lot more thought into:  

 - The benefit for both users outside of the transaction(s) to have a relationship
 - How could they maintain the relationship
 - What benefit your application provides above and beyond what any current web based (reporting, transaction, financial) application can provide

<p>Oh, yes!</p>

<p>I do all my accounting for my limited company 'in the cloud' using <strong><a href="http://FreeAgentCentral.com" rel="nofollow">FreeAgent</a></strong>. It's more hosted app, but my point is that many companies have no problems with keeping all their numbers 'somewhere there', and not in Excel spreadsheet on local machine.</p>

<p>I'm also working on a similar project right now (can't reveal any details, but it's not timesheets ;-)</p>

I'm working on a timesheet product that will be a hybrid of cloud computing and desktop applications.  It's called Clever Timesheets (http://www.clevertimesheets.com) and I will be launching it in February or March 2011 (so pretty soon).  You can go to our website and leave us your email to be notified of the launch, if you're interested ;)

Cheers

<p>We are providing this service for some time already. Since 2003, there are clients entering their time sheets into on-line solution (even thought this was not called "cloud" at that time).</p>

<p>These days we released newest generation (RIA) solution that has Time Sheet functionality integrated in basic CRM / Project Management tool in quite comfortable interface, so users should not recognize whether they are working in web or desktop app.</p>
