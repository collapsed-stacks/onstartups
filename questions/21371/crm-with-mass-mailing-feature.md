Does anyhow know a good saas CRM system with the possibility of sending mass mailings to a defined group of leads?

I think this feature is the only one with is more or less the thing which is only working an a on-premise CRM system (hosted internaly in the company on own server...).

Thanks in advance for any help!

Best regards

I use SugarCRM.  I host it on slicehost using a 512MB slice, mostly because of my data storage requirements.

When emailing, I've found it necessary to follow the outline here.  Otherwise, too many results were ending up in

you could easily acheive this with Nutshell, and pipelinedeals crm through their API and by using an smtp service such as sendgrid.  37signals's CRM, although a bit overpriced should have this functionality, and probably will do it with mail providers such as MailChimp.  

I hope to get some comments from the forum and as you investigate further.

If you're a smaller business, I'd suggest getting something that takes all of your operations into account. Otherwise you may end up with additional software problems in the future. Many companies start with CRM, realize they need project management software, then billing software, etc. Having one suite of tools that does everything you need saves on costs, time, and it encourages collaboration much more than single purpose apps.
