I am currently developing an app that I intend to release commercially through Apple for iOS. If that is the only freelance development I am doing, are there any benefits to registering an LLC before signing up for the Apple Developer Program?

I am the only developer working on this project, though I might be paying someone else to do a few graphics for me.

The general purpose of having an LLC (or corporation) as a business entity is to protect your personal assets from business-related liabilities. Do you envision needing this kind of protection?

One of the other reasons for incorporating is to take advantage of the established process of issuing stock, if you plan to receive investment or think you're going to sell your company. You can do something analogous with a LLC through something called membership interest, though a corporation is preferred by companies that plan to receive large amounts of investment/want to go public. 

If you opt not to form a LLC or incorporate, then your business is considered a sole proprietorship. Raising investment for a sole proprietorship isn't easy, but that may not be your goal at this point. Furthermore, you can incorporate later if your goals change, though there may be tax implications to the transfer of valuable IP from your sole proprietorship to a corporation.
