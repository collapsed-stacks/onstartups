I am looking for a list of venture capital, private equity and angel investors. Are these lists available online or do I need to subscribe to a service?
Also where can I find complete lists of investment banks and institutional investors?

<p><strong>There is no complete list of all VCs and angels.</strong> <a href="http://www.thefunded.com/" rel="nofollow">TheFunded is the classical resource for entrepreneurs</a> for this topic, with most/almost all major VCs listed, and lots of valuable info.</p>
