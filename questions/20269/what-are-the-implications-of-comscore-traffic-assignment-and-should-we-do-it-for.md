## What are the implications of comscore traffic assignment and should we do it for premium ad network?

We are a publisher and niche social network in the fashion vertical and are talking to a couple of premium ad networks. We think we can get higher CPM, better quality ads through one of these networks. But there's a catch. They would like to to "assign" our traffic (in ComScore) to either the ad network itself (e.g. Glam Media) or in another case a major fashion magazine who's ad inventory we would be then be displaying.

The argument from the ad networks is that ad sales staff need to point to the overall reach of the network in ComScore, and also have some proof that they do indeed represent our inventory.

Is this standard procedure? Is it a good idea to go along with it? Or are there hidden costs or drawbacks that we should know about?

Any insight you can share would be much appreciated.

I ran a travel site for some time and in comscore I was always compared to  TravelAdNetwork and I always had to take them out of the picture as I considered they were not a competitor. 

The reality is that they are a competitor for Advertisers dollars, and it is true that they can actually be represented by the aggregate of their network of sites they serve. This is standard, so you shouldn't be surprised by it.
