We create screencasting software that user use to create software demos or tutorial. I know there is CamStudio which is free, but:

1. CamStudio's codec is too worse: our codec produce file just 1/3 of that created by CamStudio.
2. Our product created compress videos that can be uploaded directly to YouTube or Vimeo. CamStudio Can't
3. CamStudio doesn't have the edit function. We do.

And many others...

While I'm sure our product is of value to software company or just website. But I really don't know how to promote it.

You don't have to give it away for free to everyone, but why not find a few big-name bloggers who actually do screencasts, and offer it to them for free? Have good how-to articles on creating screencasts, not just with your software, but in general. Try to create something people will find of value to draw them to your website, and then have a great demo or trial version to get them using your product. Find some software companies that could really profit from your software and call them up - even if they don't want to buy, just having the conversation may teach you more about your software's selling point and weaknesses.

Sounds very similar to Jing, made by the Camtasia people

http://www.techsmith.com/jing/

Jing is a yearly price of $14 or so, so you could pitch it as being a one-time fee and get bloggers to review it?

Also at Techsmith they also do a free service called http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html but as apps go into the cloud, I didnt want to download software on my PC's and simply use www.screenr.com to capture my screens and post on twitter/youtube. This has the flexibility to work off any device (tablet, ipod, mac, pc) so I think I would only pay for a service that gave me editting capabilities via a website and not a software download.

Why not offer it as free to incubators or other startup communities that have startups.

Offer free support and do webinars once or twice a week to demo the software.  

Email the creators of a bunch of startup related podcasts, make offer to Jason Calicanis to disseminate, tweet it, etc.  

Have a blog on your site, etc.

Give it away for free for now.  

EDIT

I feel I must add some comments - since "giving it away for free" does nothing to help the customers - you have to help them succeed with it.  So run promotions, find out about your customers and engage them in Q&A and support and help.

Given the nature of your product you are in a great position to bring that help to them

Another idea is to run a contest for "best video" of some sort - either a best "how to" or anything creative - to get people to use your softwaer and share it with you and the community.  The rules are only that they make it with your software.  

You can have a free year - totally free year for intros - and anyone who enters the contest gets more freebies - winner gets something, etc.

Just some thoughts on what I might try...

Yes, I agree with all the above comments. Nevertheless, give it away for FREE. Is your software OS specific or is it available for MAC as well? If it's not available on MAC OS can you recode or compile it for another platform...is that hard to do? I don't know..I am not a developer. But having another opensource Screen capturing software for MAC OS would be great. Not to mention in the future if you decides to charge, the app store is a great mall for shopper.

I checked your site and saw your product.

Your site is awful. 

What I wish to see first is screenshots of software.
You could even make screencast of your product.

Look at camtasia website. I have paid them $299 for 1 license but it is great software for work.

If you will have a better software with better website then you will get sales.

BTW Were are you located. Is not clear from your website but your customer will wish to know that is well.
