my partner and I are creating a start-up and I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice about negotiating with an angel investor. The start-up is a social networking website for pets. We have a full business plan and design of this concept, which we pitched to an angel investor today, and they are really interested. They are willing to give us $50,000+ with office space, resources, etc. for 50% of the company and if we reach a certain amount of users (3,100) by the 4th month they will dilute their shares to a locked 26.1% returning the 23.9% to us. (What is this called when they return a % of shares to us after a milestone?)

They also said they would bring us an additional $500,000 for 10% of the company after the 3rd month once we prove ourselves, but this is all an assumption, so we are not counting on this.

*Do you think this makes sense and is a good plan, or no? *We don't really want to give them the 50% to start; we would prefer (obviously) to just give them the 26.1%. Why do you think they want to do this? *We are planning to negotiate for $75,000 for 26.1% non-dilutable.

PLEASE let me know your thoughts.

Thank you!

<p>No Game.</p>

<p>Check out how <a href="http://ycombinator.com/faq.html" rel="nofollow">YCombinator</a>, <a href="http://www.techstars.org/" rel="nofollow">TechStars</a>, <a href="http://angel.co/" rel="nofollow">AngelList</a> etc. work. They take &lt; 10% of your company for tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Quote from YCombinator FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How much do you invest?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Usually $11,000 + $3000 per founder.
  So $17,000 for two founders, $20,000
  for three or more. Occasionally we
  invest more. The goal is usually to
  give you enough money to build an
  impressive prototype or version 1,
  which you can then use to get further
  funding.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What does Y Combinator get out of this?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Stock in the startup, from 2-10% of
  it. Usually 6 or 7%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Investors like this are either inexperienced or not serious. In either case they're not good.</p>

<p>Tim made a point in the comments, and I'd like to clarify. I'm not saying you should play it big and release &lt; 10%. I'm saying that 50% is just off the charts. Even 26.1% is very, very high. I'm sure you can do better.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> YCombinator have <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html" rel="nofollow">published standardized papers</a> for Seed Rounds that are generally accepted as VERY good. I suggest you read them, as well as <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/08/term-sheet-series-wrap-up.html" rel="nofollow">Brad Feld's term sheet series</a>, to fully understand startup investings. Your valuations may differ, but your investors are suggesting a very non-standard deal that may just screw up your future financing.</p>

Do your due diligence: have they invested in any famous startup? They seem to be some kind of incubator, if they want to provide you with space.

50% is wrong, unless it's a super handson incubator, and even then. The giving back of equity based on milestones doesn't make much sense. Suppose you don't hit your milestone. The startup is not succeeding as expected. So they keep more of something worth nothing. What do you think will happen? You'll quit in disgut. So what's the value to them, of forcing such a deal on you?

Really, look around. My impression is that you have very little (some powerpoint, a plan). Make progress, execute and launch something. You'd be amazed how far you can go without funding nowdays. Then look for real angels.

So, should we ask we would like 75k for locked 26.1% instead of 50k for 50% of the company and if we reach a certain amount of users (3,100) by the 4th month they will dilute their shares to a locked 26.1%? 

Do you have any suggestion for our negotiation?  Thank you!

Thank you Alain. Our investors have their well known own start up that raised over 4M within past two years. They're providing their hosting, office space etc for 4 months until we get an additional investment which is an assumption however they were able to raise 4M for their start up means they can do this for us. Until we hit this milestone they're going to hold %50 of the company however we're not comfortable with this.  We want to offer them %26.1 non dilutable shares and ask more money but I think as founders we should be able to have non dilutable shares as well such as %20 of the company. Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you!
