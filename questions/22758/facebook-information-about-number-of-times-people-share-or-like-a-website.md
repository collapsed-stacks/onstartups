**Use Sharedcount** like this: http://sharedcount.com/?url=http://answers.onstartups.com (replace the url param with the url you want to track.

If you just want **facebook shares**, you can use the facebook graph api:
http://graph.facebook.com/?ids=http://answers.onstartups.com

Again, just replace the url parameter with the one you want info on.
