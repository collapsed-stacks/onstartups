My company (TheRedPin.com) has a blog (TheRedPin.com/blog), which covers many facets of real estate news about Toronto's new condo developments, Canada's real estate news and many other aspects of real estate. 

I'm trying to expand our reach because I know this information is extremely useful to new home buyers out there. So I'm trying to find a way to syndicate my blog with blog aggregators out there so that I could be reachable through their platforms. 

Can you please make any recommendations regarding what platforms are best for this purpose and whether you have any other suggestions for me to expand the blog's reach.

Thank you in advance,

Rokham Fard

The biggest thing from a Syndication perspective is to ensure that you have a valid RSS feed available, those are all that you need for syndication via the primary sources.

The second thing that I would look at here is to ensure that your site has been optimized for Search Engine's.  (Valid keywords, descriptions, friendly URLs)

The final thing I would say here is to get others to link to you, if you have good content, and people are linking to you, that will help search placement, and overall traffic.

If you want to go beyond RSS, then you want to actually allow others to use your data.

Here are a few options:
1. Write your blog entries in the format of news releases and then have a news PR service actually push them out.  

2. Make sure that your blog entries update your facebook fan page and twitter page.  This is not hard to do with many blog platforms, or if you are using DISCUSS for comments. 

3. To get fancy you can allow other sites to re-publish your content.  You can just provide the raw RSS, and teach them how they could parse it (SERVER SIDE for best results) with popular languages such as PHP or ASP, copying the articles to their own blog or site.

<p>Assuming your syndication is formatted nicely you would distribute, <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/q/3041/1920">Here is a list of various aggregators to ping</a>. You will likely find a good distribution chain through just pinging the blog aggregators more aggressively than you may currenly be doing now.</p>
