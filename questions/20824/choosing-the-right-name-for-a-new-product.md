Do you know any good resources(books, links, courses) from which I can learn how to choose a good name for a new product. This is about marketing I think(but I might be wrong) so I need some guidance.

Thank you

PS: Until now I've find this book which is pretty valuable and right to the topic:

pfiou.... This is almost the hardest part ;-) in one of my startup we changed the name 5 times in one year! 

 1. The domain name should be available in .com 
 2. The name should be easy to remember for someone who doesn't know you and what you do
 3. Careful about spelling, sometimes by collapsing two word (for your domain) it could be read differently
 4. Does it work in other language (pronunciation) in case you want to open in other countries
 5. don't choose funny name if you want to give an image of seriousname.. Forget the "OOPSEE" or stuff like that if you are a medical device company.
 6. Don't get too stuck on the name.. it might change quickly!!

Amazon has nothing to do with shopping
Apple is a fruit
Mint? fot financial services?
Yahoo? internet portal?

The magic is not finding a name that will be both original and will immediately TELL your customers what you're all about before they even pay a visit...

The magic is building a brand, on a seemingly random word, and making sure LATER every person on earth identifies it with YOU and your product.

so. find a random word that's not a turnoff and that's available -- and name your startup.

There are services that sell pre packaged brand names for .com's.  Some include logos, stationary and more to sweeten the deal. If you can afford it, and you lack creativity try reaching out to a firm like that.  

NameBase.com is a good sample

<p><a href="http://www.seravia.com/howto/How+Do+I+Choose+and+Claim+the+Right+Company+Name%253F-x36dd?q=name" rel="nofollow">Here is a link</a> to a guide I recently wrote on how to pick a company name. A lot of the marketing considerations are relevant to picking a product name as well. The guide also discusses trademark registration, which may or may not be important to you.</p>
