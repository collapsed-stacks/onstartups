## Accept payment over the phone

We are using paypal for a subscription software product. We are about to start selling over the phone and want to accept CCs over the phone. It seems like paypal should be able to do this, but I have heard that paypal will require the user to log into paypal if their CC is connected to a paypal account.

We don't want to ask users for their paypal password; is their a way to get around this? Is there a paypal service (even if it is not free) that does not require this?

Thanks,
Matt

I'm not sure about PayPal, but Authorize.net will allow you to do this.  If you have an account with them, there's a portal that you can use to login and create transactions manually.  This is all done with their website without the need to integrate their payment system into their website.

Personally for this purpose I use a merchant account that I setup through Intuit, they charge a $7.95 a month fee plus the transaction fees, but it works like a charm and is easy.  They even have an iPhone app for it!

What you need is a merchant credit card account. Start with your bank, or shop around on the internet. Look for one with a simple web interface where you can enter transactions by hand over an SSL web page. No special software or credit card terminal is needed.
