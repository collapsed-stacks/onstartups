<p>I completed my MBA in 2012 and then worked for 6 months as an analyst, but quit my job to work on a startup. 
I am not a technical person so I hired a company to develop the website and we ran into a lot of vendor issues and now, after a year, I am giving up on the project because I have run out of money and motivation. I am trying to get back to a job but I have no particular skill sets to market myself to companies. In the past one year, I did extensive research, met a lot of people, marketed a little, hired a team etc. but I feel I don't have anything substantial to write in my resume. I am 24 y.o. and I feel so depressed all the time. I just don't know what to do. I haven't earned anything in the past year and have exhausted all my savings too. Should I study again? (Possibly a masters, but this means my MBA has gone to waste) or should I look for a job? I don't know if I can get any job. I want to get back to my startup sometime in the future but not now. I feel completely lost. Please help! Any thoughts would be appreciated. </p>

<p>Career in Jeopardy seems a bit dramatic - what career are you pursuing?</p>

<p>Despite all the Hollywood glamour &amp; press distortions, startups are unstable, difficult places to work - with no guarantees of making it big. </p>

<p>And that life experience is worthwhile for some employers. Getting another degree won't help you learn this (and certainly won't help your financial condition).</p>

<p><strong>But what did you learn?</strong> If you can't point to "anything substantial" during this phase then you should reconsider jumping back into an unstructured environment again.  Sure, its fun running the ship / hiring people / seeing your idea take shape - but that alone is a hobby if you don't pair it with customer development / budgeting trade offs, tons of grunt work.  All the things that are not glamorous that starting a business requires. </p>

<p>All the best with your future - life isn't meant to be easy all the time. </p>

<p>I'm 26 and in your shoes too. But I did one thing differently, I didn't quit my day time job when I was forming my startup. Waited until I was sure that I can scale without having a full time position elsewhere. My advice, keep working. <strong>Don't quit! Yet.</strong></p>

<p>I am right now 9 months in the development phase of my startup and sometimes I also feel that I don't have any interest or why the hell I am doing this? This is called Innovators Dilemma, my friend. </p>

<p>There is a nice article posted in Quora <a href="http://www.quora.com/Y-Combinator/Whats-it-like-to-get-rejected-by-Y-Combinator" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p><strong>Pain is temporary, Giving up is permanent!</strong></p>
