I came across this youtube chanel: [lunch.is][1]  
I watch it and I'm not sure if that is how an average presentation in front of angels look like.

###Is the above videos something one should get inspired to make their presentation?

This is the channel for the Launch conference, which is basically the same as TechCrunch 50 used to be (I was once on stage at TC50).

So yes, if you are launching at a conference, this is a pretty good example of how to do it.

If you are presenting to a VC privately during a meeting, the presentation is completely different.
