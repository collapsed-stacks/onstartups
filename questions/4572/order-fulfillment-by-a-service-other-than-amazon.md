My product will be produced by a 3rd party manufacturer, and I am not overly keen to rent my own warehouse/hire a staff for order fulfillment (at least until we begin to scale).

We will be selling our product through our own site - but would like to outsource packaging and shipping, etc.

I've seen a post on this site that mentions William B. Meyer and SBC Fulfillment...any others out there?  What have been your experiences with these companies?  Are they worth the cost?

Amazon seems best, but last I read they were not accepting our type of product (clothing) for consideration in their program.

Thanks!

WBM is great... been using them for a long time. There's dozens of other pick & pack places though, just be super careful you choose.

The first company that we outsourced to, shut their doors and fired all their staff with no notice. Companies were literarly scrambling to get their inventory out of the unsecured warehouse which was being ransacked... http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2005/07/the_end_of_a_co.html
