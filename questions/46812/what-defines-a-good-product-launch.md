I have a product that I am ready to launch. What are the absolute critical processes to go through to launch the product properly? What events should definitely happen? E.g. online launch, website, press release, physical launch?

If you could have a superbowl ad for free inviting people to use your product (I assume it's software, if not ignore this msg). Would you take it?

Or would you like to ramp up slowly, testing your infrastructure as you gain more and more traffic and traction, making the necessary changes as you go forward to compensate and adjust. 

At the very least, you need a website, press release and some online campaign, either viral based on social media or through ads, depending on what kind of audience you're trying to attract and whether you're free, freemium or paid only service.

In short- it would help if you wrote a few lines about the product without disclosing details. Is it software? something else? free? premium? freemium? mobile? SaaS? desktop?
