As a Canadian married to an American, you can move to the US once you secure a green card. You must apply for the green card in Canada at a US Embassy. You will need documentation on your marriage and will have to schedule a personal interview. Once you have a green card you get a Social Security Card and can legally work, live, run a business, etc in the U.S.

As for money, there are no requirements for money that I know of. Anyone with a green card can live and work in the US.

<p>You don't need anything to buy a business in the US. If you want to <strong>work</strong> in that business - you need a working visa (TN that you can get as a Canadian citizen can do, you can apply for H1B which is a little less flexible, but more reliable once you get it, and your wife can petition you for a green card - if you intend to move to the US permanently).</p>

<p>If your wife petitions you for green card <strong>she</strong> will have to prove sufficient funds (which are pretty low, if you have the means to buy a viable business - you're probably there). For TN/H1B - the <strong>business</strong> will have to prove ability to pay.</p>

<p>Consider visiting Area 51 and committing on the <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/10331/immigration?referrer=0j_DoRUICeQol9v5ZE6xNQ2">Immigration</a> topic, for a more relevant Q&amp;A site to appear on stackExchange.</p>
