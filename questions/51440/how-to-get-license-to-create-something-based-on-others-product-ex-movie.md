<p>I'm an indie game developer and I have a plan to create a video game that is based on the anime/manga story called <em>One Piece</em>. </p>

<p>The business thing is very new to me, so I wonder how and who I should contact to get a license to create a game based on <em>One Piece</em>.</p>

<p>Throughout my research, I've found out that it is a company called Namco Bandai Games that publishes (almost) ALL the One Piece games, which are created by Bandai themselves, or other smaller companies in Japan. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_video_games" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_One_Piece_video_games</a></p>

<p>So does that mean that they are the guys I have to contact? Or how can I be sure that they are the ones I have to contact? And if they are, and give me the rights, how much money or how big of a percentage of money (that I earn) do big companies like that want to take from me, to be allowed to create a <em>One Piece</em> game?</p>

<p>Or how does the process even go? Should I send them an email, meet them in Japan, make a deal and get a contract, then go home again?</p>

<p>I don't even know where to start researching to learn this stuff. Again, I'm very new into this business thing, so if anyone can give me some topics that are important to learn about that would help when dealing with these situations, it would be very appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<p>You should start with the studio which makes the series, they would likely be the copyright holder, or can point you to the copyright holder<br>
Although I see one major problem, which is that likely Namco holds the licensing rights for this and typically those are exclusive.<br>
I would definitely check with the studio though, From wiki it seems <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shueisha" rel="nofollow">Shuesha</a></p>
