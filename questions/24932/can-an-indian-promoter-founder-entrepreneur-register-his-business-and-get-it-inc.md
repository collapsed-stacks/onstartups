What is the US law that deals with regulations for incorporated entities? In India, we have the Indian Companies Act, 1956.

I am an entrepreneur. I want to know if I can register my business as a company in the US? That means, I want to register my business with the registrar of companies in the US as an incorporated body in the US. It will then be a US company, and I'll slowly build presence in the US.

For a start, I'll be conducting business from India. Is that possible? Do you know anyone that has done that?

Any help in this matter, of experience or legal counsel, I would highly appreciate. Thank you.

Yes, it is possible to do what you want to do - I have helped ~30 foreign companies and entrepreneurs, from a variety of countries (including India), through the process.

In the U.S., corporations are formed pursuant to state, rather than federal, laws.

I recommend that you use my blog's Foreign Countries page (http://danashultz.com/blog/foreign-countries/) as a starting point. If you examine the posts linked to (directly and indirectly) from there, most of your questions probably will be answered.

Dana Shultz is right- it doesn't matter where the owner/founder/etc. lives or is from.  (Excluding North Korea, etc.)
