When I joined a friend at our start-up I said I'd do two years then leave (I want to do other things), so we raised seed and my two years were up a few months ago.  Now we're trying to raised a series A, and I intend to leave as soon as the round is closed.

Do I have a moral obligation to my co-founders to tell them now, or will they have to declare this during due diligence?  Which might put the deal in jeopardy?  

I'll work my notice and everything and not screw my co-founders over in anyway, but should I remind them now?

Since you've made up your mind, you should be clear as soon as possible so that everyone can plan for the future. It's not only a mora obligation, it's a business strategy issue.
When a co-founder leaves, that will have an impact, so, the sooner the other co-founders know, the better you all can prepare the exit so that the business does not suffer.
