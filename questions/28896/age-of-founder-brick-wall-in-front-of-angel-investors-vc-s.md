Legally speaking it isn't a problem that i'm seventeen years old, in my country it is allowed to start a business at 16+. A cantonal judge removed some other boundaries so that I'm now fully responsible, I can sign contracts, etc. I finished formal education a couple of months ago so i'm legally spoken just like any other "grown-up entrepreneur".

My first intention six months ago was to immediately "get money, get office space, get programmers & bring it big&fast", fully exploiting the market state back then, fully exploiting the power of the "feel-good" story and of course the hockey puck momentum.

However back then I was scared to "get zuckerberg'd" by angels/vc's. Befriended programmers were just way to hard to work with (brilliant people but easily distracted, hard to motivate, never sticked to deadlines and some had some autism characteristics). So I decided to get my own hands dirty.

The last six months i've worked my ass off to improve in almost every way possible. I've done tremendous amount research on tons of subjects/persons/companies, basically from highly scalable cloud based back-end architectures to human behavior/leadership, and everything in between.

With all this new gathered knowledge I've created a product that is almost ready to launch.(Finishing it will take me alone like two months; with the right people hired +- 0.5/1 month)

Now I've reached the end phase of development there are suddenly multiple billion dollar companies making fast steps towards me. I'm still clearly ahead, however I'm sure I will not be in another 3/6 months.

Freaked out by the steps made by competition, I have applied to a "hybrid" angel/vc firm (the product is matching perfectly with their portfolio); No response(got some weird error however about the powerpoint attached when submitting & the body of the confirmation email was empty) After that I emailed one of the VC's with a link to a online version I made containing the questions + powerpoint; no response; no visitors on that page.

I'd like some opinions on my potential options:

 1. Just launch; if i make it profitable from the start > "extreme growth possibilities" close to zero, probably get poor results & statistics > no interests from VC's in the future
 2. Just launch; don't care about making money > risking 10/20K+ debt if i can't pay the bills before the end of the month(shouldn't be too hard get some money flowing from angels/vc's tough if you're continuously in the media)
 3. Mass emailing & doing online applications /contact forms @ all mayor vc's & angels (here & there some changes, like not mentioning my age...)
 4. Personal approach; how?  i'm not "socially proven" on LinkedIn, I was thinking more about 2 minute video pitch: i'm a much better talker than a writer anyways. 
 5. Search a experienced & well connected cofounder.
 6. Mass email beta keys to vc's and angels, they will fall in love with what i've created, if they actually would try...(like said above the vc who I emailed previously didn't even click the link in the email I sent him)

So basically how can I get them to drop that bitch shield for just long enough for me to explain the situation & for them to get interested? I would love to go to some local meetups but i'm (currently?) located in europe, $1k+ on flight tickets/ hotels for just meeting random vc's/angels (in the US) is a bit extreme. I would certainly spend it if they showed some serious interest. 

I have numerous of well connected (smalltime) entrepreneurs around me, too bad they are all non-tech related and don't have vc/angel connections.

Oh and don't mention that i'm too young/delusional/it can't be done: It can be done.

Your age by itself is not the problem. It may be your attitude, or you simply have unrealistic expectations.

Are you saying that you emailed a powerpoint to an investor, and are surprised they didn't even open it? That's normal. I suggest you read venturehacks.com and other sites that will give you good advice on how to get investors to pay attention to you.

In addition to learning the etiquette of how to approach investors, you need to take some time to do an introspective. 

Learn what you're good at, and what your not. It's impossible to be good at everything, so once you realize this, you will immediately start to benefit from the knowledge. 

Also realize that a lot of investors don't like investing in one-pony shows. The idea might be amazing, but what happens if you die? The company dies with you, because you ARE the company. Great product or not, most investors are betting on the jockey, and not the horse. They might like your idea, and your product, but if they don't think they can work with you, they wont even try. Case in point, most of the angels I know rate "coach-ability" of the business team as the most important criteria when evaluating a business proposal. 

In light of this, and in light of your concerns with your age, why not find someone to partner with that will augment any shortcomings you might have, and work well as the face of the company. An Entrepreneur friend of mine was selling IT consulting services to large corporations a few years ago, or rather he was trying to. He did very well in all of the initial phases of contract acquisition, but when it came to the pitch to the CEO, he was loosing the contracts. After a few months he finally asked a CEO why they didn't accept his bid, even though they were obviously pleased with it. The CEO told him his age was a huge issue, and they weren't sure if he could actually deliver on his promises because he lacked credentials. 

To solve this problem, my friend hired one of our professors to "front" the company. He met with clients, and fed my friend with leads, once the clients were satisfied, and contract negotiations were opened, the professor would hand it off to my friend. Since then, he's not lost a single contract.
