I was working for quite a time with US company which is S Corporation.
Now we are planning to continue as partners and I should get 10% of the company.
As far as I understand I cant be a shareholder of S Corp as I'm not a US citizen.

What is best way to resolve this? We cant start a new company at this stage as we have big clients base already.

I would appreciate any useful comments on this as I have no previous experience dealing with US businesses.

I'm also looking for a good books to read to better understand types of businesses, operations with shares etc. I'm more a technical person with no experience in running business.

You can be an S corporation shareholder if you are a resident alien (a green card holder).

If you are a non-resident alien, you can be a shareholder - then the corporation will automatically convert from S to C.

You cannot solve your problem by creating an intermediate entity, because that entity cannot be an S corporation shareholder.

<p>You're right, non-US citizens can't be a shareholder of an S Corporation.  </p>

<p><strong>You always have the option of converting your S Corp to a C Corp</strong>, where non-citizen shareholders are allowed.  Converting from one type of business to another is not trivial, and there's a lot to think about, financially and legally, but people do it.  (Just be sure to talk to all of the important people that you should before making this leap--your lawyer, accountant, shareholders, etc.)  </p>

<p>And if you're going to do this, it has more implications beyond just allowing non-citizen shareholders, so take the time to learn those differences, and figure out what kind of impact those differences would have on your business.</p>

<p>Converting from one type to another is not equivalent to starting a new company, so don't worry about that; you'll keep all of your existing clients.  Just make sure you've got all your shareholders on board.</p>
