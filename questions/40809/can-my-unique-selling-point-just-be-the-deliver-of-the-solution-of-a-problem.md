I am creating a new website and it's a very common one, about upcoming events. The difference of me and the competition is how I deliver the events to the people that is kind of strange and clever also.

Can this be my unique selling point? Or in the battle of the startups I need more than this?

<p>USP is overused in many circles - and with different definitions.  </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia uses the definition</a> penned by Reeves in "Reality in Advertising" as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each advertisement must make a proposition to the consumer. Not just
words, not just product puffery, not just show-window advertising.
Each advertisement must say to each reader: "Buy this product, and
you will get this specific benefit." The proposition must be one
that the competition either cannot, or does not, offer. </li>
<li>It must be unique â€” either a uniqueness of the brand or a claim not 
otherwise made in that particular field of advertising.</li>
<li>The proposition must be so strong that it can move the mass millions,
i.e., pull over new customers to your product</li>
</ol>

<p>The battle is not between startups but between your defined target market, their price anchors, and the alternatives they use to address the problem / condition you assume that they have. How many members in the target market have you interviewed?  Discussed / validated the problem and their desire to address it? Their willingness to pay for the "solution" you offer?  </p>

<p>The natural outcome of this effort is your USP (or a pivot towards finding a lucrative USP).</p>

<p>While its not easy to do, the nice thing is - all this can be done before ever writing a single line of code: which would likely be easier (and cheaper) than trying to convince someone to use a service that doesn't meet their needs. </p>
