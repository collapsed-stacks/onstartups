welcome to this site! :-)

Regarding your question, I'm sorry to say it's going to be hard for us to be really helpful as the question is right now.

You don't say which country you're in, and that would clearly be required to answer your question. Additionally, the "minimum salary" gives off a bad vibe, it sounds .. as if your business isn't doing to well. That is not a good starting point for building a great employee-company relation.

Maybe you could find a way to re-cast the situation, and make it more appealing for a prospective Ops Manager?

<p>There is a lot more detail needed. There is a huge difference in pay scales depending on the industry, company size, location, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Most operations people (like myself) are ultra-generalists who also posses expertise in certain areas. Mix of our skills can often make us one of the top paid people in the company, because we are responsible for the mission critical areas of the business. We run the "nuts and blots" of the business! Good operations guy/gal can make or break your business. Do you really want to go for someone who will take you "minimum salary"?</p>

<p>If this is the 1st time you are looking at operations professionals, check out my article <a href="http://theoperationsguy.com/what-to-look-for-in-coo-head-of-operations" rel="nofollow" title="What to Look for in a Chief Right Hand Person (COO, VP of Operations)">What to Look for in a Chief Right Hand Person (COO, VP of Operations)</a> . A lot of points I mention apply to even junior levels ops guys and gals.</p>

<p>P.S. You can also play with salary.com. They provide some guideline data.</p>

We don't have enough information answer effectively. Salary is an important but actually minor part of the equation. Where are you located? What's the condition of the company? What is the outlook for the company? What are the working conditions? What are the position requirements?

At an absolute minimum, do some research and reading to help you properly evaluate and describe the position. Use places like your local chamber of commerce and web sites like salary.com for some salary estimates. Advertise the position, interview candidates, and discuss salary requirements for them. This will help you confirm that you're in the correct range or adjust your expectations.
