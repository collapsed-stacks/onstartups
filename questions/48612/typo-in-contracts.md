I have found a typo in a contract that we are currently disputing with one of our service providers. The typo seems to change the implied meaning of the paragraph:

`... fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, to be aid by the party against whom enforcement...`

`aid` should be `paid`. 

How would this been seen in a court or arbitration?

IANAL, but to the best of my knowledge it would be seen as exactly what it is: a typo. The intention is obviously not that the other party should "aid" (aka help, assist) because then it would be "aid-*ed*".
