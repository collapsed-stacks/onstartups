<p>This depends a lot on what you do. Pre-money evaluations vary widely. Some things to consider are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Like Products or Services: Find another company that is doing something similar. You can check out this <a href="https://www.pwcmoneytree.com/MTPublic/ns/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">site</a> for who has gotten what in terms of funding.</li>
<li>The Team: How seasoned is the team and what is their track record? Based on your question, you probably are not that experienced with doing startups.</li>
<li>The Technology: Do you have IP? Is the idea even protectable? All of these things either add or detract from the value.</li>
<li>The Market: Is it a hot market or even a market at all? What competitors are out there that might eat your lunch once you are in the market?</li>
<li>The Milestones: What milestones will you achieve with the money raised? Is that realistic or just a dream, based on what other people have done?</li>
</ul>

<p>So, without knowing your specific idea, market or your team dynamics, evaluating your pre-money evaluation will be tricky but the questions about will be how you would eventually get to an evaluation.</p>

Salman Khan has some tutorial on his page regarding Venture Capital and Capital Markets.  I found this very helpful. He does a great job of explaining a number of concepts related to capital markets.  Some of the tutorials are a bit high level for what you are looking for.  Have a look (http://www.khanacademy.org/).
