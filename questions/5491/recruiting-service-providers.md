I look at smart companies like- campusfoods.com, mint.com, restaurant.com and get amazed at how they struck up a deal to connect with the actual service providers.

how did CampusFoods recruit so many Campus restaurants, same thing with Mint.com, how did they manage to get the banks on board to share their information.

Banks aren't that hard a lot of them have apis. But the restaurants are more interesting, I think the reason campusfood had so much success is that they are owned by dotmenu and already had standing connections.
