I'm looking for a good solution for a cloud-based project management software for startups.

I really like 37 Signals "Basecamp", but cannot justify the monthly fee at this moment with all the open-source alternatives.

**I need this core functionality:**

 - Time Tracking
 - Project/task management
 - Document uploads

**Some nice to haves:**

 - Instant messenger
 - Runs on open-source (mysql)
 - Ajax-y interface
 - Document editor

Anyone have suggestions? I have used Zoho in the past, but my business partners do not like that.

Any opensource alternatives would be great :)

You may find that you can justify the fee pretty quickly if nothing else does what you want :)

I currently use Redmine a bit; it's not quite as simple a basecamp but it does help for tracking more complex information.

Have you considered using **Google Apps**? I know it is not hype but it is probably all you need.

You can create spreadsheets the way you want to manage time tracking and tasks. You can upload any type of documents and you get live chat and online collaboration on documents.

Collabtive (http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/index.php) is awesome software, if you can install it on your web server. It doesn't have a document editor, but every other feature you are looking for is included. I used it and I love it.

Redmine is a basecamp knock off and it's great. We used to use basecamp but needed more features and the ability to customize it.

It rocks.

[Open Atrium](http://openatrium.com/) is the best open source project management solution I have found.

<p>Teambox is open source, <a href="http://teambox.com/tour" rel="nofollow">does exactly what you need</a> (project management, time tracking, document uploads) and it looks much better than Collabtive. Their <a href="https://beta.teambox.com" rel="nofollow">beta 4</a> looks even sleeker, faster, and with better UX, comparable to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJWO4uX4itY#t=12" rel="nofollow">Wrike</a>, but it's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamboxapp/posts/10150456080777261" rel="nofollow">not open sourced yet</a>.</p>

<p>Watch their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qS9CsjKLRQ" rel="nofollow">video of the beta</a>, or try it out at <a href="https://beta.teambox.com" rel="nofollow">https://beta.teambox.com</a> after you create an account at <a href="http://teambox.com" rel="nofollow">http://teambox.com</a>.</p>
