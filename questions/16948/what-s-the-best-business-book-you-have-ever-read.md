<p>If you need <strong>pragmatism</strong>, <strong>inspiration</strong>, and <strong>business</strong> all wrapped into a single book, I cannot recommend more highly <strong><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0887307280" rel="nofollow">The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This book has done more for my business than any single business book. I read about one to two dozen business books per year for the last 4 years, but this is a rare gem that I re-read every year.</p>

<p>The main concept of the title is continual business development to achieve a well-documented, repeatable franchise business model. This book has completely transformed they way I develop and manage my own business; a paradigm shift if you will.</p>

<p>I run a manufacturing company. Everything has become a well-documented process that is part of a highly-tuned system. All the docs are in the company wiki where they can be easily updated, including pictures of how jigs are supposed to be positioned  on the drill-press, etc. Now it's effortless to bring in new employees and have them hit the ground running. The best thing is now that every step is documented the system does not rely on a particular human's skill-set or knowledge, especially me as the founder. I try to think of my business as <em>the McDonalds of the manufacturing world</em>.</p>

<p>Regarding inspiration, the author presents a case-study throughout the entire book (usually at the end of each chapter to reinforce the chapter material). It is essentially a conversation between the author and a struggling bakery owner and how she overcomes adversity.</p>

<p>I have really enjoyed <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0066620996" rel="nofollow">Good To Great</a> by Jim Collins. It uses cases studies of large companies and tries to pull out the things that they have in common in an empirical way. Are those common factors what made them successful? Hard to say. Some of the companies profiled in book can't be considered successful anymore, Circuit City for one. But are they no longer successful because the methodology of the book is flawed, or did they stop doing to the things that made them great? Again, no easy answer.</p>

<p>The thing I try to remember whenever I read any business book is that it is not THE answer. Building your company using the fad business book of the moment as your infallible sacred text is probably not the best strategy.</p>

I think the best books are the ones that teach you a lot. (Maybe it’s just me but i don’t like to read books with a few nuggets of useful information or rebranded/reworded think and grow rich books) A book im reading right now has taught me a lot about business it’s called "Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers “Written by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur. Its easy to read it has clear explanations with examples. I Like it so much that i will read it again.

What a great reading selection we have here.  I'll add one of my favorites, **Small Giants by Bo Buckingham**.  It chronicles entrepreneurial companies like Steam Anchor Beer and others who run their businesses by an entirely different set of values.

<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0449207862" rel="nofollow"><strong>Winning Through Intimidation by Robert J. Ringer</strong></a></p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pcXMr.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>I searched through used bookstores for years before finding this 1970's-era paperback.  Don't let the provocative title turn you away - it's really about how <strong><em>not</em></strong> to be intimidated by others.</p>

<p>Among Ringer's gems is that there are only three types of people in the business world...</p>

<ol>
<li>Those who tell you outright that
they're out to get all your chips,
then proceed to do just that. </li>
<li>Those who tell you that they're not after
your chips (you deserve your fair share, after all) and then
go after your chips anyway. </li>
<li>Those who tell you that they're not after
your chips <strong><em>and</em></strong> <em><strong>really mean it</em></strong>,
but, due to extenuating
circumstances, regretfully find it
necessary to go after your chips.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pessimistic?  For sure, but also very pragmatic.        </p>

<p>It's not what you think.</p>

<p>Yes, the book does tell you how to be a better salesperson, but it does so with an holistic perspective - the organizational advice is practical and will help your entire team function better. </p>
