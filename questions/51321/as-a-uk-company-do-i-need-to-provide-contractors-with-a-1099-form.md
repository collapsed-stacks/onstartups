<p>I'm looking for hire a few US freelancer for some small web tasks.</p>

<p>I've read that US companies need to provide their contractors with a 1099 form if the contractor has earned more then $600 in a calendar year.</p>

<p>Does this apply for UK companies too?</p>

<p>As far as I know you aren't REQUIRED to<br>
But to be honest I don't think it'll hurt, if you're working with 1 person, it's a 10-15 job to fill out the form, and will likely help. Establishing a solid papertrail that you worked with the person in case of disputes later</p>
