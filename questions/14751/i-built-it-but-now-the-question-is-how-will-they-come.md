I built a location based Fan site around Guy Fieri and his TV show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives with a companion iPhone app called "Flavortown" that shows all 400+ locations he's visited.

The iPhone app has comments, ratings, sharing via Facebook, videos and coupons from the location owners.

My question now is, how can I clone, brand and sell this iPhone app concept to a national brand like Applebees, Perkins or just smaller businesses that have multiple locations?

I'm an engineer and not a sales / marketing guy?

First off, is the code written in such a way that it can be easily cloned?  Take the StackExchange network of sites.  They are written such that it takes a very short amount of time to create a new site.  If the code isn't written for easy clonability, I would make that my first priority.  

Since I am also not a sales guy, I would target the smaller, local companies first.  Maybe even build a prototype app for them with their store locations and demo it to them.
