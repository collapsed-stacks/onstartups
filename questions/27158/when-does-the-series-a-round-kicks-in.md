We are preparing a business plan for our next startup and this time we are planning to raise seed funds of $300K for 12 months with a milestone. We will enter the private BETA program for a group of selected customers 6 months after seed funding. 
My question is when are we eligible to raise further funds for Series A? After 12 months or after 6 months? What if we complete the milestones before 12 months and what about if not?

Thank you

A funding Series is kinda subjective. Usually, you raise a Series A when you have hit your seed money milestones, raised a significant amount of money or your investor wants to evaluate your company (e.g. set a round price).

I would say start thinking about what your Series A will look like now and start the process of raising it. You can never start raising money too early and if you hit your milestones with seed early, then you will be ahead of the game.
