I'm a software developer from Argentina looking to start a long lasting trust relationship with software entrepeneurs for providing high quality offshore development/programming services. Does anyone know of a site/forum where I could get in touch with such people?
Thanks in advance!

I like sourcing from LinkedIn. A lot of the groups will usually have developers kicking around that you can connect with, which also has the added benefit of having references of quality attached to their profile. Remember that price isn't always everything. If you have to pay them 3x as long as someone that's good but twice as expensive, you still come out with over 30% in savings. 

Good luck, and the best advice I can give you is be extremely detailed in your specifications sheets and workflows, and ask them how they like them to be submitted. Happy sourcing :-)

I agree with the stackoverflow careers site.
Why not try applying to jobs in areas with significant startup activity? You will probably need to contact hundreds in order to find one company that is interested (most companies hire locally). 

You can use offshore platforms, but the competition is very significant:
