I've been getting a pitch from a company called Blackwood Productions about some SEO services that are supposed to greatly increase my organic traffic. Without going into all of the specifics, does anyone have experience with services from this company? I'm trying to decide whether this makes sense or not.

Chris,

I don't know Blackwood Productions but I'd be highly skeptical of any company promising that. Ask for references.

There are many groups which will tell you they can greatly increase your traffic. The challenge is sorting out which are "all hat, no cattle" and which are actually "cattle". 

My suggestion is to structure an agreement so that you only pay if they do help you achieve a dramatic increase in the right kind of traffic. In other words, if they are as good as they tell you they are - great - everyone wins. If not, you're not out any cash.
