<p>I am new to making/managing websites. Infact, I haven't even dipped my toe in yet.</p>

<p>I have an idea with a potential client base in Millions(education related). </p>

<p>The content is being provided by a team of specialists on the subject.</p>

<p>We plan to:</p>

<p>1- Make a part of the websites(videos) absolutely free. </p>

<p>I am wondering whether this in itself can make us some ad revenue and how to figure out potential revenue.</p>

<p>2- After the videos, the content and one-on-one interaction etc are a selling point. </p>

<p>3- Potential ad clients: Schools, colleges, study abroad centers etc. </p>

<p>This part I am not completely sure about. The number of people coming to the site will be a factor or the number of subscriber base?</p>

<p>I don't have the funds to start this venture on my own. I am looking to get the numbers in place to start working on the funding part. </p>

<p>I hope someone would be willing to help get me off the ground on the above points.  </p>

<p>Most important among all this is can a education based video website be run just on ad revenue without revenue from any other source?</p>

<p>Please help with your wealth of experience.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
