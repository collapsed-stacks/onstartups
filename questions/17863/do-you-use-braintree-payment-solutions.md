This is Monica from Braintree. Regarding Frank's comment, you're not at risk if your processing choices ever break. You can work with any merchant account provider you choose and you can even maintain a back up account if you want. There are also other billing providers that work in conjunction with Braintree. If you decided to leave, Braintree would help you port your data to a new provider without a cancellation fee.

Hope that helps! You can see what others are saying about Braintree here: http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/buzz

Braintree is great, but you are locked into their gateway, that is a huge minus for us.  The problem with building on an exclusive gateway such as paypal or braintree is that if your processing choices ever break so will your app.

If you dont foresee changes to your processing then they are one of the best.
