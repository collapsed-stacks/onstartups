We are building a SAAS based application for temp staffing firms and we are done with 70% of the application. We are looking for some early feedback and then go on to build the 30% of the functionality. 

The firms with whom I am in touch for this product are taking a hell lot of time to respond as they are busy in their daily routines. We cannot go to forums and blogs as we are NOT yet done with application.

Here is what I am thinking:

1. Develop complete functionality (100%) and then go to internet (blogs etc) to find BETA testers. 
2. OR Offer 2-3 staffing firms equity or money for their time. 
3. OR Hire on hourly basis folks from this industry who will test and provide feedback.
4. OR add one more partner from this industry who will do this job.

I would appreciate it if you could provide some advise.

<p>How about...</p>

<p>5) Package what you have now into a <strong><a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html" rel="nofollow">minimum viable product</a></strong> and release that as soon as you can to quickly get feedback, allowing if necessary your first customers to use it for free during a trial period.</p>

<p>The problem being, even though you think you know EXACTLY what to build, it's VERY unlikely that it's exactly what the customer wants to pay for. The sooner you can get feedback on this the better.</p>

<p>The discussion of product development in startups is so common and so problematic that there's a whole movement called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gary_Blank#Customer_Development" rel="nofollow">Customer Development</a> developed around it. I suggest that you a soon as possible buy the books <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0976470705" rel="nofollow">The four steps to epiphany</a> and <a href="http://leanpub.com/startuplessonslearned" rel="nofollow">Startup Lesson Learned</a>. Both books are practically bibles when it comes to building and launching products while minimizing your risk.</p>

<p>I suggest that you also start reading the blogs of the authors: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/" rel="nofollow">Startup lessons learned</a></li>
<li><a href="http://steveblank.com/" rel="nofollow">Steve Blank</a></li>
<li>... as well as <a href="http://37signals.com/svn" rel="nofollow">the blog of 37signals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>... all are filled with insightfulness about the problem you're facing.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

What about showing a demo page? Any user can use your product and leave you feedback.

You would want to control de demo page; number of instances and of course cap the memory to minimum.
