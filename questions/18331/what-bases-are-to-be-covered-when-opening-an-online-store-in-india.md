What are the things one has to consider when opening an online store in India besides the website itself  ?  
Where all one has to register ?  
Registrations Fee ?  
Which state/city is most friendly for an e-commerce site ?  
Where can one find statistics about current e-stores in India ?    
Any other tips/suggestions ?  
I am planning to sell only in India right now
