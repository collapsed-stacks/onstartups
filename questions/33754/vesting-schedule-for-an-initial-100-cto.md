Classic case startup, 1 biz-dev + 1 techie. The 1 techie gets to be the lone warrior to build the entire contraption. The gut rule seems 50-50, but there are complications with that. What's a better vesting schedule or ownership compensation or way to split this up.

<p>While you are building the "entire contraption" - who will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>finding users</li>
<li>finding customers</li>
<li>selling the product</li>
<li>dealing with the financials</li>
<li>dealing with the legals</li>
<li>dealing with marketing</li>
<li>etc?</li>
</ul>

<p>You should probably read <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6949/forming-a-new-software-startup-how-do-i-allocate-ownership-fairly">Joel Spolsky's comments</a> on whether equity should be "fair".</p>

It's a tough call really. I don't have any links handy, but I've read of people in similar situations having the Biz-dev guy throw in some start up funds (or extra funds if both sides are already putting something in). Nothing major ($2-5k maybe), and they're to be used solely for server/software/hardware costs the techie encounters.
