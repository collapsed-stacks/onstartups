<p>I developed a software program that helped me perform my daily tasks at work and I am in the process of going through the Office of Technology/Intellectual property at the university I work for.</p>

<p>I developed this program outside university hours but I am fine with having the university help me out in terms of commercializing. </p>

<p>Has anyone went through that route? Any comments or things to watch out for. I searched but there wasn't anything that pertained to this specific question.</p>
