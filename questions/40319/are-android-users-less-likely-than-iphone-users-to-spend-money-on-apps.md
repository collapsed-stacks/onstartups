I've been told that Android users are less prone to download _paid_ apps compared with iPhone/iOS users. Is this true?

I haven't yet researched this matter or found any useful statistics but since hearing this, I've been casually interviewing people around me and they seem to confirm this notion. 

Are Android really less likely to pay for apps? What sources could I use to evaluate this?

So you have literally done no research except for asking the people that you run into for their opinions and you thought that asking a question here would be your first course of action?

This took me ~1 minute to find and it is only slightly dated.
