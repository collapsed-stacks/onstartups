Am forming a Pvt.Ltd. company in India, with my partner.  This is going to be a consulting company, primarily depending on our skill sets.  Since it is going to be a private limited company with equal number of shares with us, we will end up sharing profits equally.  

Being consultancy, we expect profits to be around 80% of revenue.  How do we ensure that we both contribute whole heartedly in the business, and not just await 50% of profit because 50% of shares are owned by each.  My worry is, if my partner decides to do something else for his revenue other than this company, he will still be able to claim 50% of profit, as he owns 50% of equity shares.

Need advance on how I can protect my interest.

The way this would normally be handled in a startup is as follows.

1. You don't give anyone equity right away. Equity must vest. I would suggest making the first 25% of each person's equity vest after one year, and then have 2% vest each month after that.  If one person leaves before the year is out, they have no equity.

2. Decide who is going to be CEO. The CEO has the ability to hire and fire. If you are CEO, you each have 50% of the equity, but if your partner doesn't pull his or her weight, you simply fire them before the first year is out, and they will not own anything.

3. You do not have to pay salaries at 50-50 just because you are each 50% owners. You can keep a timesheet of how many hours each of you work, and pay each person proportionally to the number of hours that they worked.

I don't know the details of your situation (or familiarity with India's laws), but have you considered not having a partner?

If you're worried your partner won't contribute 50% of time to the business, then 50% is the wrong amount of shares to give.  Especially if you think the person wants to start their own side venture, then you adjust the shares depending on what you think the worth of the partner's contribution is.

Consider forming two separate companies - and contract out his services when you need them.

You need to think clearly if this partnership is right for you.  To be honest, you should only be going into this arrangement if you're absolutely happy you can trust each other.  Once you start in business there will be moments that trust is tested. For example when there's a delivery to be made, and 18 hour days are required will you both be up for that?

If before you even start you're questioning "What if he doesn't pull his weight?" I'd suggest it is not the right arrangement or the right partner.

Like emptyset says perhaps you're better with separate companies and subcontracting him when necessary.
