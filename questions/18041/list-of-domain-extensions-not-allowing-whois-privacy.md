I know that .us domains are not allowing WhoIs Privacy.

Is there any complete or partial list of domain extensions that are not allowing this as well?

Thank you for your time.

For future reference, I found the following info at GoDaddy.com.

WhoIs Privacy is available for:

.com, .info, .net, .org, .me, .mobi, .biz, .mx, .ws, .name, .bz, .es, .nl, .tv, etc.

And, not available for the others such as:

.us, .co, .ca, etc.
