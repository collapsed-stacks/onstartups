My startup idea depends on [exploded product diagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploded_view_drawing). I have some products that I bought and have nothing to do with manufacturing, and I need simple exploded diagrams generated for these products.

What is this kind of service called? What are some good search keywords to use to find such a service?

Disclaimer: I don't plan to copy other products. I plan to provide an intuitive interface for buying parts for these products.
