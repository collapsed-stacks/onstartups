I am creating a LLC on legalzoom ...Do I need to mention the domain name of my website in the description of the business? I know I can trademark the company name, I guess I am wondering how the LLC and the domain tie together..

Thanks!

They have nothing to do with each other, you do not need to mention your domain name with your LLC paperwork.

It is possible to trademark both your company name and your domain name but you have to do a trademark search first to make sure they haven't already been taken.
