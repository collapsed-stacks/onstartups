Given that to be protected by copyright, a picture must be original/unique, I have read on the internet that **the "product pictures"** (of general use products like fridge, mobile phone etc.) **are not considered as unique and thus are not under copyright.**

**Is this true?** Or do I need an approval from every producer? 

If yes, at a first glance (just to see if it worths to spend more time about thinking of the idea & asking a lawyer) **would this case be legal?:** 

- I search on the internet the product pictures (from producer's websites and from e-shops not using watermark) & download them  
- name and sort them with a specific uniform way  
- sell the whole database to new eshops needing pictures or established eshops where these pictures are missing  

The added value: the collecting (getting pictures from dozens of sources to one database) + the sorting/naming.

Remark: I don't want to collect the description texts! **Only pictures**.

<p>I think you're confusing taking a photo of a product not being a violation of copyright with the copyright of photos someone has taken of a product.</p>

<p>If you have a refrigerator in your kitchen, and you take a photo of it and sell it, you're not violating the copyright of the refrigerator manufacturer on their design. It's a mass-produced consumer product -- not unique.</p>

<p>If you have a painting in your living room, and you take a photo of it (or scan it, or get out your water colors and paint a copy of it) and sell it, you are violating the painter's copyright. It's a unique original work (or even if it's a print, it's a licensed reproduction of a unique original work) that's protected by copyright.</p>

<p>Likewise, every photo on the web is a unique original work protected by copyright unless its been specifically released into the public domain or been given another license. If you make a copy of it and sell it, you're violating the photographer's copyright (or that of the company that purchased the copyright from the photographer).</p>

<p>Thus, I don't think your idea as proposed is legal. But I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.</p>

It all depends on what your doing and how you sell them. Fair use law might come into play.

Good Article on the subject:

Depending on what you are doing perhaps stick with Creative Commons or just buy them from a royalty free stock photo company.
