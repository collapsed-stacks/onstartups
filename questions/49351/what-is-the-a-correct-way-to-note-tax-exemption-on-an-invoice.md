My customers are rarely tax exempt, but recently I took on a job for an organization that is. They said they could provide their tax exempt number for the invoice processing. Is this necessary? Is there anything technically wrong with simply putting $0.00 in the sales tax field on the invoice? Or "EXEMPT" in the sales tax field?

I've tried searching this topic on Google but seem to only come up with documentation on using various tax software.

Where are you located? Tax Exemption status on an invoice is necessary for **your firm**. In the US, it indicates to **your state** *(if they audit you)* that you collected no sales tax on that order and the reason why. At a minimum you need to indicate their tax exempt ID number of the invoice. In practice you should request a copy of their tax exempt letter too.
