I'm launching soon, and want a creative way to say "Launching in July 2010" for the landing page of my website. Does it make sense to get creative with something like this, or should I stick to the tried and true?

I wouldn't try and get too cute. I'd say "launching in July 2010" - make sure you are really going to hit that date. Is there anything that's not public about your product that you could use to tease visitors to the landing page? Or is everything up on your site? I'd create some verbiage around the benefits to get visitors thinking about the value they'll get out of your product when it's launched.

Best success!

<p>There is a great book called "<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDon%2527t_Make_Me_Think&amp;ei=KcQITOytFsOK_Aac9KTqDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEE6VS3qqMrzRkr8YnqB3tskR4J-g" rel="nofollow">Don't Make Me Think</a>". It focuses usability and the whole point the book makes is that you should make it clear to people what is it that they are looking at and supposed to do next.</p>

<p>If you have a beta version of your product, call it Beta... everyone knows what Beta is. You won't make them think, they'll know.</p>

<p>The same applies to your question.
If you have a launch date just say "Launching in July 2010".
If you still don't have a date, stick to the "Coming Soon".</p>

<p>People will understand what that means and will not need to think much about it. Make their life easier and chances are they'll come back to chec it our once it goes live.</p>

<p>Hope this helps

It doesn't matter.

What matters is that you put a sign-up form and start collecting e-mails of interested users right now.

Being cute with the "launching in July" will improve your userbase by about 0.0001%. Having a thousand people signed-up when you launch could mean the difference between a startup dead at launch, and a thriving community.

Your choice.
