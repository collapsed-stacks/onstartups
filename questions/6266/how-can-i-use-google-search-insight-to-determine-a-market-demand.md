When I try to get how much users are interested in my new product, I will try to get some data from Google search insight. But there is a problem in the data, that is it is only a relative data on all the google search terms, so, I can't estimate the absolute search times of some keyword. Is there any way I can find some exact data like: how many times user search this keyword in an area? Thanks!

<p>The <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" rel="nofollow">Google Keyword Tool</a> could be what you are looking for.  It will tell you a specific local and global search volume, and also cost per click for adwords.  </p>

<p>There are also other 'keyword tools' out there if you want to search for that term.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends" rel="nofollow">Google Trends</a> is a handy tool to see how terms are changing over time.  </p>

<p>Also agree with Denis re building fast landing pages, adding analytics and driving some Adwords.  This short exercise can yield a lot of information.</p>

I think the easiest way is to go ahead and build a coming-soon page for your product or service (with a google analytics tracker attached).  Ask visitors to leave their email address which might give you an audience of interested people to answer other questions about your product.

Then run a modest adwords campaign using the keywords you think are important. After a few weeks, you'll have a pretty good idea of the absolute volume of people who'll be interested enough to click-through an ad.
