I will be launching my website (ecommerce site) in two weeks. I was wondering if there is an effective way (or what shoul I do) to tell people about the official launch of my website.

should it be a "welcome email" or an "invite email"? and should I send it from my personal mail as customer support or should I send it from my website`s mail.

I am figuring this out since i don`t have a marketing budget, so I have to rely on social networks & emails

any ideas? i am a first time entrepreneur so anything will be greatly appreciated!

Come up with all of the ways you are noteworthy as a hook for people to write about, remember, and share by word of mouth.

- Do you have an interesting product?
- An interesting message?
- An interesting personal or back story?
- An interesting way of doing business?
- An interesting philosophy?

Once you have your hook, get out there and tell people about it, and optimise that hook till you find it spreads!

Nobody wil remember or want to share the news of 'just another ecommerce store'.  At the same time, because of the sea of same-ness, it only takes a splash of something remarkable or noteworthy to stand out from the crowd!

If you don't have a marketing budget, one of the best strategies you should employ is SEO. Takes a while to get up but well worth the effort.
