I am a developer of an iPad application that can be used to expedite the transfer of information from patients to physicians. We are marketing to a wide variety of multispecialty adolescent clinics, and we are monetizing the app through a monthly subscription fee through the appstore.

We envision that one way to monetize the application is through corporate sponsorships (logos on the splash page of the application that physicians view) and that pharmaceutical companies in particular would be interested in sponsorships.

Unfortunately, I can't find numerical estimates of the avg amount of money we could expect to get from corporations on these sponsorships.  Does anybody have a back-of-the-envelope estimate for me, or direct me to resources where I can obtain one?

I'm not sure of any industry standards but I imagine you can sell it very much like website ad space. CPM (cost per 1,000 views).  I think it's a bit different because the splash page will be there for awhile, and also they can't click on to learn more info about the sponsors. In general 'sponsors' pay more than anything is actually valued at.

So, you might be able to charge $50 - $100/mo assuming you have decent usage.

But if you are going to go after big name sponsors might as well ask 1 to pay a ton, and not do any other sponsors. Probably preferred by the sponsor. Have one big one pay $1,000/mo and co-brand it with them.

Just some ideas.

If you're charging a monthly/weekly fee I don't think it's a good idea to do sponsorship at the same time. Most people have the perception of paid = no ads/sponsors.  Nothing to stop you from trying. But the extra effort might not be worth it... Better to spend the energy & time getting new subscriptions.
