My problem is that while I'm targeting the whole world, since this is a Greek startup, the majority of the users that sign up are Greek. The result is that they post in Greek. Later when the site gets bigger no one will be able to read the posts. What is the best way to make my social/rating site known worldwide and not just locally?

Identify your target audience.
Find where that audience can be found online.
Join community frequented by your target.
Gage interest in your product among your desired audience.
Don't try to spam or sell your product/service -- ask for reviews or opinions.
Collect new data. Make adjustments to your site. Gage opinion again.
--------------
P.S. Even if your site is in BETA and some features are not available, don't throw it at people when they come to registration page. Use clear language of what your site is about. Use proper language -- nobody is going to question it, however any form of shorthand, abbreviations, or slang is narrowing your potential audience.

I think you need to make the site's objective a little clearer.

I agree with Slate's answer - It's a little too soon to ask someone to register, before they understand what this is about and what value it might have for them.

Remember, people don't sign-up because the site looks cool. They will sign up only if they consider that there is something in it for them - a rewarding factor of some sort (recognition, information, success, fun money ...)

Next thing, you need to promote the website on the web, in international communities (just like you did here). By posting your question here, you got (at least) 2 visits to the website so far! :)  

But I didn't register... and probably I'll have forgotten the name of the site in a couple of hours... because it was not clear what value it had to me. See my point?

Hope this helps.

When conducting small business marketing, knowing your target market, having an advertising plan, and using the right business marketing strategies and tools are crucial to reach potential customers. There are a number of business marketing tools you can use to set yourself on the right track of getting your small business big attention. 
The initial step to business marketing is conducting business market research to identify your competitors and target customers. Learning who your target market is can help you create more effective ads and gain business marketing ideas. Learning who your competitors are allows you to research their market strategies in addition to their products and services. Business market research is crucial to all the steps that follow.

In your particular instance you may wish to make sure that you include a link to some sort of translator service on your website (i.e. babelfish, etc) so that everyone can read the posts, no matter where they reside.

Give them a reason to change their behavior.
you said that the majority of the users are Greek, so there's no reason for them to post in a language other than their own(Greek). 

What I think you should do is hybridize the community. target a new segment of users(international) and have them engage with existing users
