## How should early employees be compensated if founders have left and the company has pivoted?

I realize that [Joel Spoelsky has written an extensive summary](http://answers.onstartups.com/a/23326/11227) of how equity should be allocated (namely, fairly), but I was wondering how things might differ in slightly different circumstances...

I recently joined a company that pivoted only a few months before I joined. The company was still gaining traction, with probably about 6 months of runway. There were about four founders when the company started, but has since whittled down to just the one founder (with about 50% equity). I effectively replaced one of the founders as the CTO, and have been given 10% equity.

In this circumstance (or similar), where original founders have left, and the company has effectively started over, how much equity should be awarded to new employees?

<p>If you're not market rate, then it may be worth having "the talk" with your remaining founder regarding fair and appropriate equity.  That said, a <a href="http://www.socalcto.com/2012/04/cto-salary-and-equity-trends-2009-2011.html" rel="nofollow">lot</a> <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-standard-equity-percentage-given-to-a-technical-CTO-co-founder" rel="nofollow">of</a> <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/30801/20-equity-and-cto-story-and-details-is-this-fair">posts</a> seem to point to founding CTO as 10-20% (and most leaning towards the bottom of the curve) - others point towards 50 / 50%. Given that you would (likely) be considered a non-founder, the CTO numbers drop to 1-5%: but that generally assumes that the company has locked down the business model, funding worthy and in growth stage.</p>

<p>That said, there is no hard and fast rule regarding equity - It boils down to what is considered fair and reasonable. You should do your research, compare you position to others found online and present a fair and balanced recommendation to your partner. </p>

<p>Don't forget to consider vesting as part of the discussion. </p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
