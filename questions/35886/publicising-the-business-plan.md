Being a libertarian, I am completely honest with all my business-transactions, business-offerings and partnerships.

From a marketing perspective, **would it be beneficial to post my business-plan on the website where it's been implemented**?

<p><strong>The short answer: no.</strong>  Not unless your potential customers are all venture capitalists and MBA types.  For most products, <strong>the typical customer won't care or even if they do, they won't understand.</strong>  They just want to know, as quickly as possible, how you're going to help them or entertain them.</p>

<p>Business plans tend to have a lot of business jargon and legalese, and it will just get in the way for the most part.</p>

<p><strong>Instead, spend the bulk of your time optimizing your website to provide an awesome user experience.</strong>  That's what will help you, from a marketing standpoint.</p>

<p>I can honestly appreciate your desire to be open and upfront with your customers and potential customers, though.  I think it is a good idea.  And I don't think that desire should be totally discarded.</p>

<p>There will be a few customers who will want to know more about who you are and what you do.  As your site develops, <strong>rather than your full business plan, it may be a good idea to post something more readable, for those customers who are interested in knowing how you tick.</strong>  </p>

<p>For example, look at <a href="http://37signals.com/" rel="nofollow">37signals</a>.  In the middle of their page, under the title <em>"We built the company that weâ€™d want to do business with. We hope you do too,"</em> you'll see a list of eight basic principles that guide their company.  Perhaps something like that might be useful to your customers.  </p>

<p>And then, if you <em>really</em> want to give customers your business plan, have a link to it in a place like that.</p>

Only as a learning tool for others, and viral activity to your brand. Then yes!
