Excerpt from a Venture Capital book:

I'm not quite fully grasping the idea of "protection" here.  Few questions:

1.  Why is it so important to protect yourself from future investment rounds.  
2.  If an investor buy 20% of the company, they own 20% now.  How can that become diluted if the price per share is set very low in future rounds (last sentence).  I thought ownership percentage is a constant.  

Thanks for any clarification.

Hard to tell without more context, but this is probably referring to a right to participate, pro rata, in future financing round.  The idea is that if you buy 20% of the company in a Series A, then you also have the right to buy 20% of the Series B, and so on.  This provision is usually contained in an investor's rights agreement that you and the company sign when you invest.

In answer to your questions:

(1) Any round is dilutive -- in other words, when other people buy shares, your percentage of the company necessarily goes down.  If, in a later round, the company sells shares for less than what you're currently paying, then your holding goes down disproportionate to the amount you have invested.  

(2) Ownership percentage is NOT constant.  If the company has 100 issued shares today, and you buy 20 of them, you own 20%.  If the company then sells another 100 shares to somebody else, you now own 10%. 

On #2, let's say that you paid $20/share, but the next person only paid $5/share.  You would have put in a total of $400, the company's worth $2500, but you only get $250 if it folds.  (Assuming that it hasn't spent the money.)
