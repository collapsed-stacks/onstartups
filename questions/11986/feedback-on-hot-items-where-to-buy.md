How’s it goin’.  I am very new to the world of online commerce, and I would like to start selling items online. I was wondering if someone could help out by providing some feedback to some of these questions (any help would be greatly appreciated):

1.)What is a good way to find out which are the hot and/or consistently selling items?  Are there websites to look at?  Should I attend trade shows (and if so, how would I gain entry to one?  I know that they usually aren’t open to the public).  

2.) Where do most online store owners buy their items for resale?  On wholesale websites? Wholesale outlet stores? Elsewhere?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,
rbracch

<p>Ebay is a good place to check....</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://pulse.ebay.com/" rel="nofollow">pulse.ebay.com</a> and spend some time looking around there - some good demand info can be found there.</p>
