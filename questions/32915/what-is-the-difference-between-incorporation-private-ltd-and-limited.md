 I'm an IT student from India. I want to start  a new IT company in India with the name for example "Simplesoft Incorporation". I want to know, what is the difference between using incorporation and private ltd and limited? Please if anyone knows then tell me as simple as you can.

Note: I can't answer for India, but in general:

 - Limited Ltd Corporation or Corp Incorporated Inc. etc. imply a private limited company
 - PLC = **Public** Limited Company (UK/Europe) = company issuing shares to the public on a stock exchange.
 - In North America, this private/public distinction in naming (and the PLC term ) aren't used. 

The rules in Canada are that you have to use the **exact** form you registered the company with. So if I registered as ACME Inc. I can't use ACME Ltd. or even ACME Incorporated. 

The meanings of Limited, Ltd, Inc., Incorporated, Corporation, Corp., are (in Canada) identical.

Usual not-a-lawyer / not-legal-advice restrictions apply.
