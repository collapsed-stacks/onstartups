I applied for the winter 2009 DC Program. It sounds interesting and useful to learn all about starting a new venture. But would love to hear from someone who has attended previously.

I was one of the mentors for the Silicon Valley semester and attended most of the sessions. What can I say? It's great and apply! Half of the value is in the formal program. The other half is in the people you'll meet. As they say, I wish this was around when I started 15 years ago.
