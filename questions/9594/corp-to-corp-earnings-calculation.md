I have registered a corporation and I am working in the state of PA.  I am trying to get a handle on estimated earnings.

I have to pay several different kinds of taxes. Is this a good list of taxes?

***On total Income*** 

 - Employment tax 10%

***On corporations profits***

- Federal Income Tax 24% (or whatever bracket I fall into)
- State Income Tax 3.08% (flat rate in PA)

***On my salaray***

- Federal Income Tax 24% (or whatever bracket I fall into)
- State Income Tax 3.08% (flat rate in PA)
- Social Security 12.40%

**Sample Calculation**

For sake of calculations, let's say I contract at $48.07 per hour on a Corp to Corp basis which, working 40 hours a week for a year becomes $100,000

So here are my calculations 

 - Corporate Income $100K
 - Payroll Tax (10%) = 10K

 - My Salary $40K

 - My personal Income after Federal (24%), State (3.07%) and Social Security (12.40%) deductions is $24,212

 - Corporate expenses $10k
 - Corporate Income after Federal (24%) and State (3.07%) deductions is $29,172

Am I correct in assuming these figures or am I missing anything?

Possibly city/local taxes; you may have to pay that.

I'm assuming your filing as an S-corp (pass through), instead of having your company pay taxes. If not, then you'd pay corporate tax and dividends tax.
