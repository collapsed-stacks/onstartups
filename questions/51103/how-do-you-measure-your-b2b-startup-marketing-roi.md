<p>A common practice for measuring B2B marketing ROI is by adopting a funneling approach in tracking prospects and customers. Rather than explaining it here, it would be a good idea to see how others visualize it:</p>

</ul>

<p>The challenging part is putting these concepts into action. Google Analytics and a decent CRM are good starting points.</p>

<p>The best way to manage your B2B marketing is to test different channels and record the tests in a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>The key instrumentation you'll need is some way to capture the traffic source (CAC) + conversions inside your application to measure LTV</p>

<p>Here's what I've done.</p>

<p>Example sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Google Adwords</li>
<li>Newsletter</li>
<li>Banner Ads</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I run a campaign for each, spending around $500-$1000 focusing on a general benefit statement (ex: The fastest way to X) to drive traffic to the same landing page.</p>

<p>From the landing page there's usually a conversion step (Email, Signup, etc), but the key is to get an email.</p>

<p>From there, you want to track that user in your app (even if they don't signup now, using their email or cookie, you can do this).</p>

<p>So the funnel should be.</p>

<ol>
<li># of Click (CTR)</li>
<li># of Views to Signup (Coversion Rate)</li>
<li>$ spent ($500)</li>
<li>$ CPL (Cost per Lead, = Conv / $ spend)</li>
<li>$ LTV (Lifetime Value, did they purchase or subscribe)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you run these experiments per channel, you should start to see some that have better CPL &amp; CAC then others.</p>

<p>Even if you learn that your CAC is averaging WAY MORE then your LTV, that's o.k.  There's always opportunity to improve each step by 10%, or improve the products value (or pricing) to get your LTV higher.</p>

<p>Just knowing how much it costs you to get a customer is a big deal.</p>
