I have just been approached to work as a consultant for a company and its PR team to give ideas and improve their website. they need me because they don't have the knowledge of my ethic group. I know this company takes in around Â£35 million a year for the business. How much do you think I can charge?

Thanks!

<p>Keep in mind, you're pitching to professional pitchers.  If you really want to impress them, and if it's a large enough contract to justify the work involved, first define their need.  Use the PRSA site as a great resource to determine what this agency is looking for from you.  They're not looking at you as the definitive source on all that is (insert your ethnicity).  They're trying to fulfill a business goal to reach a market.  They've had a section devoted to cross-cultural communications for many years now, and they have a <a href="http://diversity.prsa.org/" rel="nofollow">blog</a> and the <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Diversity/?utm_source=prsa_website&amp;utm_medium=top_nav_intelligence&amp;utm_campaign=diversity_nav" rel="nofollow">Diversity Page of PRSA</a>. I can say with every confidence that they are paying close attention to ROI, and they are seeking some one who is very honed in on not just their target market, but on their goals in communications.</p>

<p>After that, I'd present a mockup with a proposal on SEO and target marketing.  The price will depend on how badly they want to get into that market, so this will need to be negotiated with you directly after they've heard your proposal.</p>

My advice, pitch yourself on an hourly rate.  Make sure they are comfortable with your hourly rate of say $200 per hour.  THen let them know that this presention would be (example)

8 hours research
4 competitor analysis
4 hours prep
1 hour presentation

plus+ materials

So the client recognises your ability to connect with your ethnic group and wants your help in improving their service to that community.

What you'll focus on today won't be the same as next month and three months time, even though the resulting actions (changes to the website) are the same. Your time will divide between planning, engaging externally, and recommending internally. But anticipating the workload may have a lot of speculation.

So I'd have thought you would want a framework agreement that provides:

* A minimum and maximum time commitment measured in hours per month
* The way you're going to tell them what you've done, and what you plan to do
* The commercial rates you're going to apply

A retainer would be great, but they can be hard to come by! $X/month covering the minimum agreed hours, plus $Y per hour for additional hours up to the maximum, gives simplicity to all parties.
