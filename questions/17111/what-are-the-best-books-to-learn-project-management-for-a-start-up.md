For software development there is a couple:

 - Managing Humans by Michael Lopp
 - Getting Real by 37 Signals
 - The Mythical Man Month by Fred P. Brooks

For hardware or other development, I have not really found a good one. The techniques in those three books can be applied to hardware but the interesting thing about hardware is that:

 1. It's hard to revise in the field
 2. There are certain features you cannot live without (e.g. like a power supply)
 3. Most hardware problems are usually fixed in software because hardware is expensive to spin.

<p>I like <strong><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/159184312X" rel="nofollow">Making Ideas Happen</a> by Scott Belsky</strong> (not to be confused with <strong>Making Things Happen by Scott Berkum</strong>, mentioned here as well). </p>

<p>I think you need to learn from the Management guru also, Peter Drucker.
Some of his recommended books are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1560006250" rel="nofollow">Concept Of The Corporation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1422120651" rel="nofollow">People and Performance</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0060833459" rel="nofollow">The Effective Executive</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0060742445" rel="nofollow">The Daily Drucker</a></li>
<li>The Practice of Management</li>
<li>Managing for Results</li>
<li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0060851139" rel="nofollow">Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a></li>
<li>Managing in Times of Great change</li>
</ul>

<p>*The Effective Executive is a great one to start with</p>

<p>I'm really enjoying "<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596517718" rel="nofollow">Making Things Happen</a>" by Scott Berkun - he's a PM from Microsoft, though much of what he talks about applies to any type of project. He runs through the stages of projects, things to watch out for, how to handle different types of scenarios. He uses real examples, including some where he didn't come out shining.</p>

If you are talking about startup in the software field, there is a book called Growing Software.  Its an easy read, gives you specifics of different pm methods, and dives into handling inter project politics and timelines.

Every project is different.  Company cultures vary too.  
Your best bet is to try a few different PM methods, and find what works for you.
My companies still rely on daily, weekly, and monthly meetings and lots of excel task lists for each project.
