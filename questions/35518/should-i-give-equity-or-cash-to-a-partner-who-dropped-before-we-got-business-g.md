## Should I give equity (or cash) to a partner who dropped before we got business going

...and we never signed any founders or vesting agreements? I now know not having those agreements is the worst thing ever and won't do that again.

We are parting as friends friends so I feel like I should throw him a bone for time spent and contacts that I will use as I move on by myself.

What makes sense to offer?

<p>You should treat him as an early-stage advisor, which means the grant should be 1-2%. If you are <em>very</em> good friends with him and he <em>really</em> helped with getting the company going you may add another point or two. The top limit for some incredibly extraordinary circumstances is 5% because that's already a serious investment stake (<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/10/employee-equity-dilution.html" rel="nofollow">employee stock option pools are usually set at 10-20%</a>).</p>

<p>Also, since you didn't have any formal agreements on shares in place, you have to resolve this situation amicably - a lawsuit between friends is never a good thing, let alone when one is trying to build a company &amp; the other one is trying to take it away.</p>
