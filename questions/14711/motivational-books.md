<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek" rel="nofollow">The four hour work week</a> inspires me. Only the title though. I didn't find time to read it, but I look at the cover once in a while.</p>

I second all of the books mentioned above, one of my favorites is **REWORK**, **Founders at Work** and **The Art of the Start** by Guy Kawasaki. All of these books are easy to read and there are tons of things to learn from them.

Another of my favorites is **Peopleware** by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister. It is an excellent book and you'll learn a lot from it.

"Switch" is a really motivational business book. However, it is more appropriate if you are trying to embrace and welcome the art of *CHANGE*. -Elle

Honestly, I get my most motivation out of reading about others succeeding.... so for example I loved the new Facebook book, The Age Of Facebook and the new Google book.  Reading their stories really moves you.

***Birth of a Salesman*** by Carson V. Heady - not only the must-own how-to-sell, motivational tool, but it doubles as a fictional story of its fictional author.  Only book of its kind.  GREAT read.
