I'm seeking advice in how to go about writing a disclaimer for a software service I'm developing.

The software program is to record client medical treatment forms. I basically want to say something to effect that encryption technology is used to secure sensitive data, and we seek to maintain a high security standard, however are not liable for any loss of  information due to technical mishaps out of our control.

Does that sound feasible? How should I go about putting this into a disclaimer?

You should absolutely hire a competent attorney to help you write the disclaimer. Draft what you're wanting to accomplish and then take it to a professional. This is what they do for a living. It's also who you'll be dealing with on the other end if you ever have to rely on enforcing your disclaimer.

You're writing a disclaimer for software being used in a life critical field where privacy and accuracy are important. Invest the $200 or however much it would cost you to get a disclaimer written up by a profressional attorney.

You don't want your software to be used in the wrong way and having a large medical lawsuit on your hands because you didn't properly cover yourself for the worse by spending a couple of hundred of dollars, any competent attorney should be able to write up a disclaimer as they all have pre-written templates for this kind of thing anyway.
