I know similar questions have already asked but I think we need something slightly different:

 * Capturing user info from our website to the CRM directly via an API
 * Sending welcome, followup emails to demo users after their requests, and after the expiration of their demo
 * Other CRM, Leads management stuff
 * A way to either pull stats out of it via API or provide limited accounts to our employers so they can see all our demo, sales, leads stats in real-time
 * Not insanely expensive 

Do you think SalesForce can provide this to us? Or do we have to write our own or tweak an open source application to do this.

It's a good question; unfortunately the answer is complex.

"Salesforce" is a platform more than anything.  Out of the box it doesn't do much; with customization, scripts, and for-pay add-ons, it can literally do anything.

There isn't an open-source tool which will do all this stuff out of the box -- again it takes customization, scripts, etc..  Is it cheaper to have zero-cost tool but write and maintain more code, or pay more money monthly but buy stuff that does most of this now?  Either choice is OK -- that depends on your goals.

    * Capturing user info from our website to the CRM directly via an API
Yes
 
* Sending welcome, followup emails to demo users after their requests, and after the expiration of their demo

Yes, some email follow up; not sure if it covers all your scenarios.

    * Other CRM, Leads management stuff
Yes

    * A way to either pull stats out of it via API or provide limited accounts to our employers so they can see all our demo, sales, leads stats in real-time

Not sure about API, but can provide access to stats; integrates w/ Google AdWords, too, if I remember correctly.

    * Not insanely expensive

I don't remember the cost, but to get some of the features above, you have to buy one of the more expensive account plans.

**FWIW, This info is based on experience that is several years old
