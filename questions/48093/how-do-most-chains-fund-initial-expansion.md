I am really curious about the primary method most chain restaurants use for funding their own expansion.  Selling franchises is always an option but if the main company wants to retain ownership and control what is their primary means?  I would imagine that if the company is alright with doing it slowly then the typical path of taking out small business loans works but if they want to do it rapidly what are the best options?

Money is historically cheap, so you can get a bank loan to finance expansion. There are other options, like franchising, swapping cash for equity, etc, but if you can get a loan, that is often the best solution.
