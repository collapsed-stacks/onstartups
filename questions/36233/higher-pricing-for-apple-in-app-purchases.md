I'm contemplating pricing for my product. It is an internet based game that is sold via subscription. I planned on a price point of $1/month. I can process a credit card subscription for about 3% (figuring a year's subscription), but the lure of in-app purchases on Apple iOS devices is compelling, but the 30% cut is a bit unpalatable.

Apple [has loosened its in-app purchase policy][1]. I'm now allowed to sell subscriptions in-app and on my website at different prices.

If I do this, say offer the game at $1.50/month (net to me, $1.05) via in-app purchase and $1/month on my website (net to me $0.97) will I have customer backlash even if I both explain the higher prices are due to Apple's excessive fees and offer to drop them if Apple drops their fees?

Why not have the best of both worlds? Offer in-app subscriptions at $1.50 per month and yearly subscriptions via the website at $12. Don't offer annual subscriptions in-app.

This way customers don't see any price differences between the website and the app. All they see is that a month by month subscription is $1.50 and that you offer a better price for an annual subscription on the website.
