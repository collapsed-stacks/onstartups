I run a new apparels ecommerce business and I manually pieced up a terms & conditions page from various sources. I was just wondering if it is at all crucial to have these drafted out by a lawyer instead? If not, are there any an online versions which I can refer to? 

I've compared with my competitors and theirs are much more detailed and contains legal terms (eg. clauses). So I am kinda stuck to how should I proceed further.

What are your thoughts?

Thanks in advance.

<p>I think it really depends on where you are running your site. </p>

<p>I can speak for Germany where your terms&amp;conditions (t&amp;c) better be legally correct. There are plenty of law firms scanning sites for faulty t&amp;c making a living on "calls to order" (don't know the correct term in English) with a hefty handling fee attached.</p>

<p>So, why you can always write something up yourself, you should know the pitfalls to avoid. </p>

<p>If you don't want to go through a lawyer - in Germany there is an association for eCommerce shops called "<a href="http://www.haendlerbund.de" rel="nofollow">Haendlerbund</a>", where you get legally correct terms&amp;conditons for a 9,90â‚¬ monthly membership. Maybe there is something similar whereever you are sitting, which I guess would be the best alternative for you. </p>

<p>There are some open source examples on <a href="https://www.docracy.com/doc/search?query=terms" rel="nofollow">Docracy</a> * that you can download or branch, unfortunately I don't think there's one from an e-commerce site, but it's actually a good idea to take a peak at your competitors' and see if you missed out something. I would draft at least a first version and then ask a lawyer to review it - this should limit the damage to just a couple hundred dollars usually, and you get to sleep at night. </p>
