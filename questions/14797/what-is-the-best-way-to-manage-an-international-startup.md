My startup has employees who are in different places at different times. What is the best way to manage and to centralise files, emails, communications, ...? Would the web be the best place to start?

There are multiple tools you can use

 1. Skype for communication
 2. Collaboration & Project Management tools like Basecamp or JIRA Studio, depending on the level of complexity of your processes
 3. Google Apps for Email, Document collaboration



These should be good enough to start with

<ul>
<li><p>Skype is good (do not forget its Share screen option), but sometimes 
for audio chat <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/" rel="nofollow">Google Talk</a> works better. Also Google Talk let's 
you track your incoming GMails. And it handles sending files through
its chat window much faster than Skype.</p></li>
<li><p>However you can track all your GMails + Calendar etc on your
smartphone. But you have one already, do you?</p></li>
<li><p>Pick separate time frames during the day when it is most convenient
to chat for each employee. Choose some week day and time to have a
chat/meeting for all your    employees at once. Put some nice world
clock in people's taskbars to prevent calls in 3am...</p></li>
<li><p>Don't forget DropBox and similar - it's much easier just to save your big
document on your computer and let it do all the sync</p></li>
</ul>

You should check out the just released features of Google+ hangouts ("hangouts with extras"). You get free video conferencing with multiple people, real-time shared documents editing, and a real-time shared sketchpad. If you can't collaborate in real-time because of time zones, you can still use shared google documents.
