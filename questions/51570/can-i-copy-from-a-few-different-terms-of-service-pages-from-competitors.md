<p>I'm working with little funds so hiring a lawyer isn't an option. I'm starting a website like gazelle.com, nextworth.com, etc. and I was wondering if I can just use their concepts and piece together a terms of service based of theirs? I need to make many of the same statements.</p>

<p>You can analyze their agreements to start create your own, but it's not recommended to simply copy-paste as they have different needs from yours.</p>

<p>I'd suggest looking at 500px Terms of Service page:
<a href="http://500px.com/terms" rel="nofollow">http://500px.com/terms</a></p>

<p>Or, if you need a Privacy Policy too, have a look at LinkedIn's.</p>

<p>A free generator of Terms &amp; Conditions agreements that you can use:

<p>It's common practice, even for professional lawyers, to use a template when creating a new legal document. Using someone else's agreement as a template is acceptable.</p>

<p>If you do end up working with a lawyer later, they may want to throw away what you have and use their own template. Just be ready for that.</p>

<p>WordPress has explicitly <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tos/" rel="nofollow">open-sourced their terms of service</a> and privacy policy, which is how we made ours: </p>
