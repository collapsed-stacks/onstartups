Is agile development suitable for a startup that will outsource development?

I dont know much about agile at the moment, but just got hold of a book about agile.

My reason for asking is that ive recently started reading The Startup Owner's Manual and its mentioned a few times about customer development and agile development combined.

I have skimmed through info regarding agile and hope that its not suited only to large teams, and is suited to bootstrapping startups that dont necessarily have people all in one place maybe?

Agile is not just for large teams, in fact there are agile questions on other SE sites that discuss the perfect size.

Since you will be paying external developers you can include the requirement that agile be used. One benefit is that you will get a useable application at the end of every sprint, instead of only getting a completed application at the end of months or years of development.

We have been doing this exactly for our product development clients across the globe for last several years. We use Agile Scrum and collaborate regularly with product owner over Skype, gotomeeting and our own online project task board. It can be done and is beefing done regularly by us and several other providers.

Agile has the benefit to integrate the customer much more into the team. In the Scrum method there is a role called product owner which you should investigate. Instead of a long book you might want toread this pretty short scrum guide:
http://www.scrum.org/storage/scrumguides/Scrum_Guide.pdf

Of course there is more in agile than scrum but you will get the idea behind it quickly wuth this guide.

I must disagree with moran  on one point: you will not get a running app on EACH sprint. the first are not giving a ready app to you. And there might be features which cannot be done in one sprint.

if you use tools like jira greenhopper (there are hosted apps avail) you reflect you project status in no time. It really helps you, esp when you outsouirce development. just make you understand your method (kanban, scrum, xp whatever).
