My Website is out and think it is a great product that makes link between professionals and individuals about jobs: you can look for quotation or propose quotations.
(I'm not trying to advertise it, just to explain what the website is about).

The point here is that I can internationalize it easily into another language (~ between 1 and 2 months), basically whatever the language I can do it.

Which strategy would you suggest me?

 1. Sell the product (giving the source code to another company for localization and marketing effort);
 2. Outsource translation (+ map of the country / region) and then I sell the whole product;
 3. Find a foreign marketing partner, do the technical stuff then share earnings on foreign sales.

Any option could be valid depending on how much "firepower" do you have.
Selling in any market is not only having the right product but involves a great effort of marketing, and since your product targets specific countries, your should pay attention to the way people will get to know your product (Ads etc...). Is important to bear in mind that after sales, comes support, patches and those things.

On the basis that your product is a SaaS and is easy to internationalize, perhaps could be interesting for you to find a franchise to localize and handle the local sales/first level support. The difficulty relies on how to choose such a person/company. If you are unknown and without proven success it is quite hard, perhaps would be advisable to gain some experience at home and the go to get new markets.

The other advantage of finding a foreign marketing partner that does the marketing and selling processes is that he/she would know best his/her local market.

It sounds to me like you need to decide what business you want to be in. From your post, it sounds like you either want to "connect professionals and individuals about jobs" (whatever that means), or you want to be a software developer.

In addition to the options you and pdjota list - consider licensing of the product to players in foreign markets - either under the same brand, or as a white label.
