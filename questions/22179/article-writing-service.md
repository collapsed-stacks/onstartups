Anybody has recommendations for good article writing services for SEO purposes? Especially the one that actually writes for real people and not just churn out the article out of a random word generator (which seems to be what a lot of these “article writing services” do). I’m looking for something priced around $10 (ish) per 700-word (ish) article but the product is actually readable and understandable.

I work for Textbroker.com, and our authors write thousands of articles for SEO every month. We are an online marketplace of over 60,000 **U.S.-based** writers.  A 400-word article written by a 4-star (excellent) writer is just $9.10.

<p>You should look into <a href="http://www.ecopywriters.com" rel="nofollow">www.ECopywriters.com</a>, or check out <a href="http://www.o-desk.com" rel="nofollow">O-Desk.com</a> for individuals that you can work with. </p>

<p>I have used E-copywriters for a few projects and they have been great. Pricing, in my experience, is ~$10 for ~250 word article of high quality. They have a great customer service team and can customize special packages for all your SEO needs.</p>

<p>Have not used O-Desk for SEO...only some graphic design work, but it seems like they have professionals for all services. </p>

<p>With the kind of quality you want, I suggest you to increase your budget. </p>

<p>For writing services, I have heard good things about <a href="http://jobs.problogger.net/" rel="nofollow">Problogger JobBoard</a> You can also check elance/odesk.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.elance.com/" rel="nofollow">Elance</a> and <a href="https://www.odesk.com/" rel="nofollow">Odesk</a> are good for what you mention. I have used both for this purpose and the quality was good, price was cheap. I think about $10 an article. 750 words is on the long end, you may end up paying $15 or $20 each. </p>

<p>I've not used ecopywriters but have heard good things. </p>
