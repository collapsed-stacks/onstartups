My question is if there's a way you're using or know about
to verify an identity of a freelancer.

For example I want to sign the freelancer on a contract,<br>
he will write his ID and name on the contract,<br>
but I don't really have a way of knowing if these details are real,<br>
and in case he breaks the contract I'll have no way to react.

p.s The freelancer is this particular case is from India.

Thank you in advance.

Get a copy of his ID card and a copy of his business registration.

Simple as anything else.

Or get the cotnract signature notarized. But still collect a copy of his business registration.

Not sure what coutnry you live ni, but in most of europe you HAVE (by law) to give your identity in all business correspondence including stuff like your business registration number. Failure to do so carries significant penalties.

There is no real way to verify this kind of thing with absolute certainty. In the end, you have to make a judgement call.

As for worrying about a freelancer breaking the contract, the best way to mitigate that risk is to withhold payment until project completion, perhaps via some kind of escrow service.
