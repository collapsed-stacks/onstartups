I live in Houston, but many of the attorneys that deal with software startups (the type of business I'm involved in) are in Austin. Is it wise to find an attorney in another city to handle business formation, contracts, IP-related work, etc. I know that the attorney can introduce you to angels and VCs if that's the route you want to go, so is their network something to consider as well?

I'd really prefer to hear from people who have been down this road and have first hand experience to share.

I think the most important considerations in selecting an attorney are expertise, complementary personal style, and contacts (ability to make helpful introductions).

If you find such an attorney, location in either Houston or Austin is fine. I have worked with quite a few out-of-area clients; in many cases, we have never met in person, all communications being via phone or e-mail.
