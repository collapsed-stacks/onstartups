Go to http://www.hubspot.com and just read all their blogs and sign up for their webinars and whatnot.  It'll be more than you can consume.

I know this is snarky and I apologize -- 

*"I am going to roll up my sleeves and learn investment law to make my start-up succeed."* 

There is a definite advantage to Do-it-yourself. There is the joy. The fun. And definitely the immediate perceived cost savings. 

But there are disadvantages as well. And many time the cost savings is just deferring the cost until later. The templated legal docuement that didn't match my business that resulted in unnecessary paying of claims. The bad code that resulted in lost weeks of production. The poor branding that resulted in copy write violations . . . 

One of the challenges of a start-up is focusing on the core business -- and contracting for the rest. As start-up we need to choose to partner with, contract with, and engage professionals in their respective areas. The more I learn about new topics the more I learn I didn't know @$*#&.

In the end, when I have had the opportunity to hire an expert in their respective field I have always been happier with the outcome. Fast. More cost effective. Better. 

I am not saying that you going to blogs, websites, and getting "Internet marketing for Dummies" is a bad path to your start-up's success. But I do know developing a professional relationship with a professional experienced internet marketer will increase the odds.
