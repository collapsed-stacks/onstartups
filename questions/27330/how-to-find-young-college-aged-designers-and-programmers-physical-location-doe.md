I'm a co-founder of a profitable startup doing around a million in revenue a year. I'm having a great time and gaining lots of experience with this startup. 

However, I have many other ideas floating in my head and I'm looking to find some young, talented designers and programmers. My current company operates 100% digitally, so physical location doesn't matter.

I have capital and firm grasp on the business-side of a startup. Where are some good communities and forums to find young, talented designers and programmers?

Thanks in advance!

If location doesn't matter, why does age? If you are in the US, you may be considered discriminatory in hiring for stating that you want to hire "young" employees. Describe the characteristics that you want instead  - flexible, open to change, able to take direction, and be open-minded. Just because you have encountered some older people who were not open to change doesn't mean everyone is. Also, there may be older people who are still "early in their career" due to job changes.

BTW, even putting the upper limit at 35 is still age discrimination - 45 and older is the age range for discrimination complaints.

There are heaps of places - a Google search will uncover them for you. A few to start you off are:

 - odesk.com
 - elance.com
 - 99designs.com

etc, etc

(I've made this a wiki so others can add to the list.)

Design wise you didn't mention what type of design? I would look at 99 designs for quality, you can see their work and most can be contacted. For programmers try freelancer.com or maybe if you like better communication in the Philippines onlinejobs.ph

<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">Hacker News</a> is a popular online hangout for entrepreneurially-minded programmers. Becoming involved that community might be a good way to find the talent you're after.</p>

I assume you mean USD not ZWD, so how about the designers/programmers you have at your existing startup?

Or, how about asking them for recommmendations?
