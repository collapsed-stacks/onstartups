I've been working on a site. It started as a side project to teach myself a bunch of things but now that it's live I'd really like to pump some life into it.

Functionality is limited; basically, users can post suggestions on how something could be better. I am currently working on allowing other users to "act" on a suggestion, which might make the whole thing a little more interesting.

Anyway, taking into account I am on a limited budget here, and leaving things like "make a facebook page" or "tweet about it", which I truly don't believe in as marketing approaches, what are my best options for attracting some traffic to the site?

I would suggesting using a site like Stumbleupon.com.  You can allocate a daily budget that will allow you to reach as many users as your budget allows.  The users on the site also "stumble" based on the topics they are interested in.  This will allow you to reach your target demographic in an efficient and cost effective manner.

One possibility is public radio. I noticed two separate stories appeared on public radio both with a lot of local appeal in the content of the story. One was about a coop for backyard grown vegetables. The other was about sharing household items with your community instead of buying more or keeping unused items in storage. It is a very grass-roots feel and generates interest in the crowd that is pre-disposed and already in the same mindset. The veggie coop was featured on a cooking radio program.

One of the simplest ways is to share the information on social networking sites. Another thing is to get people to blog about your site.

I would say submit it to directories as well. http://dmoz.org is one directory I frequent. Social networking can be great as well. Have you thought about making a facebook app that is related to this? That can be a good way to generate "buzz" about your site and get people to use it who may otherwise not (via facebook).
