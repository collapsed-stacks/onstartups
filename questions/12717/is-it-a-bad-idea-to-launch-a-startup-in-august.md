We have a service that will be ready to launch in 2 weeks.
Is it a bad idea to launch it in August? Should we wait until September?

The fact is the service is ready, and I don't like the idea of waiting one month just for the period. I could run a private beta, but still.

Say we go out in two weeks, do you think press coverage will have little effect because most people are on holiday?

I'm going against the grain here.

First off, it completely depends on how much awareness of the launch you're *really* going to generate with press releases, blog postings, etc.

When I get back from vacation, I simply delete most of what's in my RSS reader -- a huge pile of news builds up, and I just don't have the time to read it all, so why try. I think many other people do the same. If you generate a lot of press in the first weeks of August, you're wasting it. Wait until at least the second half of August, possibly the last week of August.

So I'd propose something like this: **Make a critical estimation on how much high-quality coverage (influential bloggers, mainstream media) you're really going to get.** If you think you're going to get significant attention (many startups don't), then postpone the official launch until late August, but start a "private" beta now. Your "private" beta should be private by name, but really you should try to get as many people in as you can. And then "launch" in late August / early September with as much publicity as possible.

If you don't have something unique to interest the media with (rockstar team, seriously cool and innovative app), then you're unlikely to generate substantial hype. In that case, just launch now, and build awareness bit by bit.

<p>Unless you are guaranteed coverage from <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> or <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">RWW</a>, any coverage you are going to get is not going to make or break you.  </p>

<p>Release now and continue to iterate!</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

It is always a bad time to start a startup. You are fighting against the time. Do not waste you time waiting for the perfect moment.

I doubt that press coverage will have any effect at all.  (Or that there will be press coverage)

My opinion is "why wait?"

Go live now - no sense in putting it off.

Unless you're planning to build a lot of hype over your product with the extra month, I'd say there's little to lose with launching asap. Launching later may very well be a significant opportunity cost.

Will waiting save you any money, ie, one month burn rates?  If the only downside is the concern over vacations and press releases, I would say go for it. In these time everyone is connected electronically 24/7/365.25 and will see the releases anyway, while on vaca.

Go for it. I'd be more worried about customer coverage.

<p>Go ahead and launch.  It is too easy to procrastinate for this reason and that.  If you a real concerned about it do a soft launch in August and a harder launch with PR later.</p>
