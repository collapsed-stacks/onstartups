In my startup, we have employees (paid hourly) from New Jersey and California. The startup itself is based in New York.  We're doing our payroll through Intuit, and the application is telling me I need to register (and possibly pay a fee) with those states in order to get an ID number to pay the employees unemployment contributions.

Is this true?

<p>Probably it is. For California I can tell you that not only you're required to register with the state for tax withholding, you might be liable for franchise tax as doing business in the state (that's $800 a year if you're a corporation, LLC or a LP/LLP).</p>
