I'm wondering if I can use Turbotax for my first year taxes on my startup, or should I use an accountant?  Here are the details:

 - I'm a newly formed start-up that I work on in conjunction to my day job, incorporated as a S-corp this past June 2011
 - I've got little or no 2011 revenue... been in development all this year and have an alpha site up with beta users for about a month in 2011.
 - There hasn't been any major expenditures outside technology & office item purchases and paying vendors, and I'm not planning on doing any out of the ordinary deductions
 - I'm self-funded, so every penny counts

Aside from the savings of doing both my corporate and personal taxes (I also have a W-2 from my full-time job), it just seems like my taxes should be straightforward /achievable by software like Turbotax.  Is this assumption incorrect, or are there other things to consider?

Thanks!

When it comes to taxes and especially corporate taxes with W-2 available I would recommend accountant hands down.  The reason being is that you might be able to take more of certain deductions that TurboTax usually won't show you.  Problem is that you will need to find a good one that actually knows about those deductions.
