SCORE is great as noted.  You might want to check in with your local SBA office (www.sba.gov) as they may be able to connect you with a local mentor.

Angel Investors.  Identify angel investor groups in your area (you can check out my posts on this subject if you're interested http://unchained-entrepreneur.com/new-rules-of-angel-investing/).  Then look at their websites to see if they are hosting or participating in any events.  

Also, find the individual membership of these investor groups and try and connect with them via LinkedIn.

Best of luck!

Those are two different things. As Elie noted, SCORE is a not-for-profit program that matches volunteer retired business executives with entrepreneur, and is a good start on finding advice.

Angel investors are primarily interested in finding viable companies in which to invest their funds, and while they often provide mentorship to their portfolio companies, the investment typically comes first.

You can find local groups of angel investors (most of whom don't charge you to apply to them for funding, although some do, so be sure you know what the story is) from the industry's free search engine at http://angelsoft.net

Good luck!

<p>Look up <a href="http://www.score.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">SCORE</a> if you're in the US, or try your local Chamber of Commerce for this kind of information.</p>

Linked In has hundreds of angel investor groups. I'm sure you can find a local one there.

try attending a business plan competition as a guest... The local one has an open semifinal fair and final pitch/presentation which is a great place to meet established business people and entrepreneurs
