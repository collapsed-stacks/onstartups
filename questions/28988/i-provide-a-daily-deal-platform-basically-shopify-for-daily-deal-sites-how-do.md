## I provide a daily deal platform (basically Shopify for daily deal sites). How do I improve the "deal details" part of my deal interface?

I run a daily deal platform on which others run daily deal sites.
We recently received feedback that our interface can be improved, particularly the deal details area where the price, buy button, timer, and buyer count details are housed.

How can I improve how the deal details section look?

Thanks in advance.

Personally, I would make the "Buy Now" button green, and make sure the "current offer" ribbon is always a different color from the section behind it. Right now I see that they're both red, so the ribbon completely blends in with the background. You may also want to make some gradation marks on the purchase count meter, to more clearly identify what it is. I would probably also make the height of the meter taller.
