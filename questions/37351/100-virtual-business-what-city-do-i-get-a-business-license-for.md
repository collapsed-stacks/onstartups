I will be offering virtual business services online and could potentially be "working" from anywhere. Where should I get my business license? Does the city I get it for legally matter?

Stop delusions.

Seriously.

How you get money? No bank transfer, no registered address? You can not run a 100% virtual business. YOu can run a  business with all activity online, but you still ned to take delviery for stuff, need an address for the tax office, need to take invoices for stuff like hosting - and the hosting company also wants an address.

On top you will find that not living anywhere is a progblem and the moment you live anywhere your business is legally required to be there unless you have rented offfices.

"100%  virtual" is an illusion of people that ignore what it takes to run a business.

In reality you will not live on a ship and / or move from city to city - yes, in theory you could, but you likely will not. Seriously, I could not. I really want to havea decent desk (also for some nice screens), a place for my servers at home etc.

So, you have a basis and are not fully virtual - and your local laws pretty clearly very likely sstate a b usiness must be registered where it is conducted.

So, sorry, no 100% purely virtual.

Only exceptions I see is the homeless traveller with an ultrabook that writes a travel blog ;)

I don't think you need to get a license for a virtual business. All you might need to do is register the business with the government for tax purpose and it also depends on your country. Where are you located.

I live in VA and have a Virginia based LLC and I still have to get a business license from the city I live in to run my online business. I am assuming that you are in the same scenario and so the answer is yes, you will need a business license from your city if one is required and most cities do. Check with your city to make sure but this is probably going to be true. 

If you don't get one then you may get away with it for a while but based on your federal tax returns they will catch you so its best just to comply with the law and pay for your business license up front. 

Good Luck, 
Tim - VA
