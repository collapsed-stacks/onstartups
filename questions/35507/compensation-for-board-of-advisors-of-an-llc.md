What is the best way to compensate a Board of Advisor of an LLC?  We have just started a company and would like to have about 3 advisors.  A couple of the managers know some influential people who would be great advisors due to their expertise about our business and their positions.  It is unclear whether they would be willing to advise without compensation  or not. Since we are a start up, we would have to offer something like a percentage of the annual profits.  How much is fair? What methods or vehicle should we use as an LLC?  

Also, if they did not require compensation, would we still need to have them sign an agreement?  If so, would we just leave out the remuneration clause or should it still be addressed?  If so, how?
