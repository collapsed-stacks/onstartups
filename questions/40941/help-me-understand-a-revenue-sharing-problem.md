I am part of an LLC with multiple members. We have multiple revenue streams, and expenses that are shared across the revenue streams.
One revenue stream is suppose to be split 50% to the person that brought in the business and the other 50% to be split between the other partners.
We have several other revenue streams that are shared straight across by our percentage of ownership.
  
What is the fairest way to honor the 50-50 split on the one revenue stream understanding we carry GnA and operational costs.

Welcome Steven. I'll try and give an answer here - but it's only an opinion: I would think it would be better to have a sit down with all relevant parties and hash out something that seems fair than accept an approach from someone out of the blue. 

That said, I'll assume that the 50/50 rule applies to internal and not external members.  I would think it would be fair to have GnA cut out before the proceeds are distributed.  I would also think that (if applicable) any T&E costs would be reimbursed to the individual before the split.

**Have a Minimum Profit Margin.**

It is not unusual for partnerships and LLC's to be set up so that partners/members share expenses and revenues in different proportions. I think I see your point about fairness, though. Bear with me....example 1 shows the problem I think you're talking about, and example 2 shows a solution (if I'm right about the problem).

Example 1: The Problem - 
In an 11 member LLC, one member brings in business that requires $77 of expenses to produce $100 of revenues. Assume members share expenses equally.
Final result: One member makes $43 ($50-$7=$43). 10 members lose $2 each ($5-$7=$2 loss).

Recomendation: Institute a policy that mandates a minimum operating margin. See Example 2.

Example 2: The Solution - 
In an 11 member LLC, one member brings in business that requires $55 of expenses to produce $100 of revenues. Assume members share expenses equally.
Final result: One member makes $45 ($50-$5=$45). 10 members make $0 each ($5-$5=$0).

In example 2, all members start making money if expenses are **less than** 55% of revenues (assuming expenses are carried equally by all members). Steven, your LLC will will no doubt assign revenues and expenses differently, but I think these example make the case for instituting a **minimum profit margin** policy.
Good luck.
