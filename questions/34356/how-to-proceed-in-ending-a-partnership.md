My "business" partner who mainly did nothing for 5 months on the business end is finally deciding to depart the business. I am still going to continue developing the business and the product. How do we proceed in ending the partnership?

I am now seeking a business person. What kind of traits should techies look for in a business co-founder? I need someone who is good with marketing and sales type stuff.

I realize I could probably do this all myself, but it would be overkill.

<p>I would recommend that you get something in writing stating that you own all the software you wrote. You don't want to go on an make a million dollars and have him show up in five years and claim half.</p>
