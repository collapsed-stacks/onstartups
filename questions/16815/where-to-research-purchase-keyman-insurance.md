My partner and I have been looking for keyman life insurance so one or the other could buy our equity if we were to be disabled or killed; however, finding information about a policy is difficult. 

Does anyone have recommendations of a reputable, national broker or company that does this type of insurance regularly?

It's difficult to find, because this is the wrong way to research this problem. What you're describing is a "thrown together" business continuation plan, which will work just as well as it's constructed.

Think local, not national. It's one thing to buy your car insurance from geico.com, but this is a complex problem that requires a complex, non-commodity solution. You do not have the expertise (nor can easily attain it) to solve it on your own.

As I wrote [here](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/16738/what-are-my-options-for-inexpensive-401k-plans/16805#16805)... find a *fee-only* financial advisor/consultant. They're all over, so make sure to ask for referrals from people you know. Your bank likely has one, and there are plenty of franchises of [Ameriprise](http://www.ameriprise.com/), [Edward Jones](http://www.edwardjones.com/), etc., around the country.

Not only will an FC help you with your personal/family retirement, he will be able to help you with business continuation concerns like this. He'll also be someone to go to when you have any kind of financial questions (lease vs. buy a car, etc), and will be right up there with your CPA and lawyer as far as professional advisors. And just like those professionals, they will save you much more than they cost.

You should also find a local insurance broker. If you're buying your company's insurance in this same manner (biz-insurance.com or whatever), it very likely will not work the way you think it will. Which, is a problem, since that's what's insurance is designed for.
