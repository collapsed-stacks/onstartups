If I work as a web programmer/designer for a hospital in one state, would it be ok to start a buisness doing web programming for other hospitals as long as they are not in the same state? Would this be a conflict of interest?

Talk to your management, ask them - ultimately, they are the ones that will reprimand/fire you if they find out, and most of the time, if you ask, they are generally ok with it :)
