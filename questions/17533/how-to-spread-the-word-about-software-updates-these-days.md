I am a MISV veteran but have to admit that I feel a little bit lost in the media space these days:

The editors of major computer related media seem to be fully occupied with ventilating Apple, Microsoft or Google press releases. They have successfully managed to degrade themselves to news hubs of the big ones and widely ignore MISV software.

Major blogs editors had been a fantastic option 5..6 years ago, but have become snobby and try to imitate the "big media". Consequently, they are busy with ventilating press releases of the big ones as well. The only exception to the "established" media seems to be that blogs require a product photo that has a glass table reflection in order to get published. Otherwise, it has to be something really fancy and it MUST have an iPad or iPhone adapter.

So, what are the options for *very* good and actually useful MISV software today? I feel lost.

I don't know that I agree with the premise. The "major" computer media in the past (PCWorld and so on) were just as obsessed with the top handful of companies as they are today, but today, they have largely been displaced by blogs like TechCrunch, ReadWriteWeb, and GigaOM which cover literally dozens of companies every day. There has never been a better time for a one person microISV to get attention.

Also, it's become cheaper and easier to get your message out on your own blog. A small software company in 1990 would have to spend $50,000 to attend one trade show and meet maybe 200 prospects. Today they can start a blog for $50, buy some google adwords, and get their product in front of 200 prospects a day.

That said... distribution has changed a lot. Software customers have lost patience for download-and-install software. They might tolerate it if it's a one click operation (like the iPhone app store), and they might tolerate it if the software is incredibly compelling, but the days of shareware and download.com are long gone.

How you market your product and find your audience is a huge question, and one that's too broad for this format. And you haven't told us anything about your product, so all we can do is give you broad vague generalizations.

The problem is that the MISV market is dead when it comes to attention. It's about as hot as the ISV market was in the 90's. The iPhone app store and Android marketplace is just so hugely dominant. And very deservingly so. The vertical is just so well integrated that software updates isn't really an issue (sometimes just start the app, if there's an update you'll get notified).

If you're a "very good and actually MISV software" vendor, you're one of the very few. And the media have taken notice. I'm very sad to say, but your options are likely two
1) Get into the iPhone / Android market ASAP (if you're actually a startup you're crazy not to).
2) Give up, and spend your time at sales fares, with direct marketing, and with a customer loyalty team that is in constant contact with your customer base. The way computer ISV did it in the 90's. 

Sadly, that last option won't really last. You're going to have to move to an integrated vertical.

Disclosure: I've spent five years in the MISV market. Left it 4 years ago (for good reason imho), and now I'm in advertising.

In order to get your message across to your potential customers -- you need to know your audience. I'd suggest start there - do a little research. Forget about media, there are many mediums, but those are just tools, you need to figure out your message and voice.

Here's a silly example: 
Let's say you got your wish and French media started covering your product extensively. Is it good? It could be, but what if your product was designed only for Chinese infrastructure? Certainly, any publicity could be good, especially if it's free, right? But what if your direct competitor, that targets the same Chinese market is in France?

 - Define your message
 - Identify your audience
 - Find your voice
 - Select appropriate delivery medium

Best of luck.

From the user's perspective, I like, when software suggests me to be updated itself (e.g. Firefox, Cyberduck, Filezilla, Open Office).

Regarding marketing of your software, there are plenty of tools to do that, like twitter, blogs, social networks, etc.

Learn about the power of web2.0 (sharing, collaboration, collective intelligence) and start using it in your business.

Although I understand the issue (I've the same feeling that media in general talks about the same big ones and doesn't have bandwidth for others), I have to agree with Joel. 

There are countless new opportunities to get your message out these days. 

Hundreds (actually thousands) of websites, blogs and bloggers are looking for great products and write heart-felt reviews and stories about their findings. 

Media has changed, and in all honestly, I think we keep giving too much credit to the big media outlets. 

10 independent blogger reviews are better than 1 article in a top gun magazine, mainly because the blogger's readership is probably more aligned with your ideal customer, and therefore will send more qualified traffic your way (besides leaving a trail of links to your website that will last for years to come).
