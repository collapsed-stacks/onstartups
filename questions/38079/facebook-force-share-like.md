Some new websites we visit, we have to click the "Share" or "Like" before we can view the actual content. How effective is this for viral marketing?

Thanks.

Is like "click on the ad" or "answer a few simple question" scheme. They are all negative to users. From a simple point of view I will not click on a like or share button without read before what I will "like" or "share".
