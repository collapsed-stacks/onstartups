Suppose a startup has 5 founders with the next contributions...

1: X hours of work in the startup.  
2: A patent (the design of a product never produced).  
3: $50K of funding.  
4: Marketing skills.  
5: Direct Sales skills.  

How we calculate equity based on the contributions difficult to convert to money?
What is a typical strategy to deal with this issue?

20% each.

If it works, 20% of something of value is nice to own. If it doesn't work, 20% of nothing is... well you get the picture.

In general, unless there is a compelling reason and complete agreement between all parties, it makes sense to go for an equal split. Of course, IMHO, YMMV, IANAL, etc.
