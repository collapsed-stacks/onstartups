<p>We provide an address verification webservice and have contemplated making it 100% free for a year for startups. It's already free for all 501c3 nonprofits. The problem is that we haven't found a good way to determine a startup. What is a startup? That's the question.</p>

<p>We've considered limiting it to startups in their first year, or startups that are pre-funding, or even just startups that have been through a known accelerator (or incubator).</p>
