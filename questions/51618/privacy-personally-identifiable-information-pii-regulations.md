<p>Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can someone point me to any definitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) policy regulations in the US? (as someone from outside the country there seems to be a confusing number of different agencies specifying various PII regulations).</p></li>
<li><p>If my service is hosted outside the US, and does not target US users specifically, but has some US users, am I still required to follow US PII regulations when dealing with US citizens data?</p></li>
</ol>
