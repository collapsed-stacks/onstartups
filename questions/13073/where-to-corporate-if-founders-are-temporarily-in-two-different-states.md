Currently one founder is in Michigan and one is in Texas. 

Neither of us plan to live in these states for much longer.

We both will more than likely end up in NYC. 

In the meantime, should we hold off on forming our LLC? Or should we incorporate in one of the states and then change our main place of business once we are both in the same location? How difficult will re-locating be in terms of paperwork?

Thanks.

I am not a lawyer, but setting up an LLC or S-Corp in a state like Delaware is a common practice among new businesses (that is, you don't have to form the entity in the actual state you're doing business in, or plan to do business in).

You could also form a Delaware Corporation, which is what all venture backed companies do. Then the only thing you have to do is do a foreign filing in the state where you actually do business. It costs a little more but if you really need to form something now, then that would be the best way to go.

This does all depend on the nature of the business and if you need a lot of financing or not. I agree with Dana on the LLC if you are a boot strapped startup that will not need outside financing. The only issue is where to actually form it.

<p>Questions like this come up frequently.</p>

<p>In my opinion, you should form the LLC where you will be operating the business - in this case, New York.
