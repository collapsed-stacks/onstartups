I will be the first technical employee of an early-stage startup. I don't have a ton of experience (so something like CTO would look bad and misrepresent me) but I will be doing all the software development at first and leading development when we expand the team. I've been given the freedom to pick my title.

I know that the title doesn't matter a lot, but I still need to pick one. Any advice?

<p>Lead Developer sounds appropriate.  Here is an <a href="http://www.socalcto.com/2012/07/lead-developer-to-cto-at-startup.html">interesting post</a> about this very topic.  </p>

<p>This way, you can either grow into the CTO position or into Sr. Developer, depending on your aspirations.  </p>

<p>If you read the CTO job requirements, you'll find that many competent developers don't want to follow that path (can't blame them).  </p>

In a similar position during the first dotcom boom I picked "Head Techie". It's probably my favourite job title of my career ;-)
