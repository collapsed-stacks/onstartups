Does anybody here understand the basics of online businesses (online billing- client relations management software, etc) and other aspects like hiring and working with outsourced help and Sales reps? The reason I ask is because I need help with these things. I know there are plenty of articles on these subjects but most is just reworded articles posted with affiliate links I would rather hear it from a person with personal experience. I guess you could call it mentorship or better yet consulting. I would be willing to give ad space in my monthly magazine in exchange (keep in mind that my publication is specifically for consumers rather than b2b)

I think the consensus is that you have asked about 15 different questions all in one. All of us are happy to help but we don't know where to start ... try copy / pasting parts of your question above into separate questions and the ones with specific knowledge can tackle that specific area.
