I have always been curious to know what a company gets in return for investing in a startup company that makes a healthy profit while continuing to grow. 

For example: Accel partners invested 12 million into the facebook project. We have all heard of that success story, but what I don’t know is what was negotiated when Accel partners gave them that money.

Given what was settled in the facebook/Accel contract, what should be an acceptable expectation if I am seeking from a venture capital firm? Does anyone know the answer for this?
Thanks.

I don't know about that specific deal, but in general an investor gets stock, i.e. a percentage share of the company. Of course, you can also negotiate favourable terms, etc.

I'd recommend Venture Deals by Brad Feld as it covers a whole lot of this stuff.

<p>It was an investment.  For their money, they get shares. From <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/47387334/Jim_Breyer_via_Accel_Partners" rel="nofollow">CNBC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With its 10.7-percent stake in Facebook, Accel is the largest outside
  shareholder in the company. Not everyone at Accel was enthralled with
  the idea of investing in a site that had less than 3 million users and
  no clear revenue path. But that initial investment—now worth as much
  as $6.6 billion—is looking like a pretty good deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this likely has no relevance to your situation - unless you have a "just less than 3 million users" product.  How / when you raise capital has to do with the business need, your business model &amp; the stage your company is at.</p>
