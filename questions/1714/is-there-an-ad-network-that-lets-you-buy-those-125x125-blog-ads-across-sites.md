## Is there an ad network that lets you buy those 125x125 blog ads across sites?

I don't want an ad network that puts you anywhere.  I don't want dozens of ad sizes and specs to worry about. 

I could really use an ad service that let's me easily buy and manage the basic blog ads across dozens or hundreds of targeted blogs.  Otherwise, we have to buy and manage each blog directly meaning I can handle maybe a dozen before the time spent really weighs on the ROI.

Any ideas?

<p>Check out <a href="http://buysellads.com" rel="nofollow">BuySellAds</a> -- ad sizes are pretty uniform, and you can hand-pick targeted sites where your ads are displayed.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords/displayadbuilder/target.html" rel="nofollow">target display ads</a> within Google AdWords if you put in the time, and AdSense ads are constrained to a specific list of sizes.</p>

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say... **you are approaching advertising in the wrong way**. 

Assuming that you're looking for ROI from adveritisng, the formula is very simple:

 * [Cost Per Mili] * [Total Budget] = _Number of Impressions_
 * _Number of Impressions_ * [Click-Thru Rate] = _Number of Clicks_
 * _Number of Clicks_ * [Conversion Rate] = _Number of Sales_
 * _Number of Sales_ * [Average Sale] = **Total Return**

The square-bracketed items are the variables that you can change, either by finding a different venue, improving your banners, tweaking your landing page, etc. **That is how how you achieve a positive ROI from ads**. You don't do this by trying to find a network where you can put hastily-made 125x125 banner ads.

Instead of looking for "dozens or hundreds of targeted blogs" look for a small handful of large sites (three or four tops) and invest in A/B (and even A/B/C/D/E/F/G)  testing on different banner designs, landing page designs, etc. Once you find the sites with the right CTR and CPM, just keep throwing more money at them until the ROI starts to drop off.
