I'm still at the idea stage.  The product's main component is a towel.  I imagine buying a bunch of towels at walmart or some other retail is not the way to go.  Too expensive and probably will violate several trade laws.  How do I go about finding a wholesaler/reseller of towels that will allow me to use the towel with my product (rights to resell)?

Did you even try google. Just like you can find plain t-shirts or hats to screen print, you can also get many types of towels. Options include beach, bath, hand, golf...

I would start with a local screen printing/embroidery shop. They can tell you where they get their supplies. They probably have a catalog you can look at.

Search Google to find a company in the same city or state as you (that matters for some reason) to find a company that offers a niche product in similar field and just ask nicely.  

For example, to find a wholeseller of beach towels find a wholeseller custom hats for company stores and ask them where they would go.  If you're not a competitor most people have no problem telling you where to find
