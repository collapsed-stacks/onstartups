Myself and a friend run a website.

We want to register as a Limited Liability Company in Nevada for the tax benefits. It's just us two that work on the site. This is a unique situation, though. He lives in California, and I live in Johannesburg, South Africa.

I've done a lot of research on the costs, but different websites give me different prices, I'm not entirely sure if those costs are up to date, and as I understand from what I have read, there are different types of LLC's in Nevada, differing for locals/foreigners of the state, because of this, I have done nothing but confuse myself with different statistics from different people saying different things. So I need an accurate answer to these two questions:

What are the exact up-to-date costs and requirements of registering a Nevada LLC in this situation and what type should we register for?
