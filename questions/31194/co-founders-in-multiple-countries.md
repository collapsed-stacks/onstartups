You need to pick one country as the headquarters. Think about the future. California would definitely make sense. Incorporate there and have the Australia co-founder as a shareholder. You're set.

If you also expect to have significant income from Australia, then you may have to setup another company there. You could have it owned 100% by the California corporation (to it's a subsidiary). It's a bit more expensive to have two companies, so if possible, operate with one only until this gets bigger.
