I am starting a new project for my web-based company and I think the services of an interaction design company would really help me flesh out a beautiful / usable product for my customers.

Can anyone recommend interaction designers or firms they have worked with in the past and really liked?

Please don't take this personal, but posts like this read "like a lamb walking into a den of wolves"  ;)  

I believe this type of forum would best help you on determining **what** type of usability features to think of, **how** to engage with a design firm, or **which** attributes to look for in an interaction firm.  There are many good posts on these topics in this forum - take a look through the tags.

When it comes down to it, the type of firm you select is closely typed to your target market and your specific views about your product - so while I may have had a great experience working with a firm on streamlining conversions in an ecommerce project, that doesn't mean that they will be successful with your tween oriented crowdsourcing site (if that's your target).  

Good luck, and happy reading!
