Should you look for a co-founder prior to developing a project or wait until after it has launched and shows some signs of success?

Do you spend the time and resources up front to find someone even though the project may not be successful? This way you can start over more quickly.

Or launch first, try to gain some traction and then look for a partner? Does waiting offer a better chance of finding someone or of finding someone of higher "quality"? 


Which is the better way to go?

I would suggest getting a co-founder as soon as possible. Doing a startup is a very challenging work. Doing it alone makes it ever harder. There are a couple of reasons why you should get one sooner rather than later:

1. Finding a truly compatible co-founder is like finding a needle in a haystack. The sooner you start your search the greater your chances of finding someone who you will be able to work with.

2. It gives you access to someone who constantly provides feedback on the project and the way things are being approached. This adds enormous value if the co-founder complements your own skills sets.

3. A co-founder acts an anchor when times are tough which they will be. Its a lot easier to stand your ground when you know someone has your back. 

4. Doing everything on your own will result in getting very little done. With a co-founder you can split the work and focus on the things that you are truly great at doing.

Hope this helps.

Get the word out that you are looking for a co-founder. Maybe you don't throw a lot of dollars or spend all your time on it. You can always put more effort into it once the project gets moving.
