We have a game that requires players to refer to a list of celebrity and/or cartoon characters by name. The names simply show up in print alone, along with a short, original description of the entity.

I'm not worried about the celebrity names so much as I am the use of cartoon character and/or puppet names, as those in themselves are copyrighted works. The use in itself is a game, not a cartoon, movie, or the like, so I would think it to be both "transformative" and not in direct competition with profits of the original copyrighted characters, but I could be wrong.

From my understanding, the fair use doctrine on copyright use follows the following:

>  1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
>     is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
>  2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
>  3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
>     the copyrighted work as a whole; and
>  4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
>     the copyrighted work.

<h2>Answering the above in terms of the game (from what I think):</h2>

1. It is commercial, however...
2. It is transformative in nature (not a derivative) of the copyrighted work
3. It is not very substantive, since it's only a reference to their names
4. The game would not seem to be in direct competition with the markets of the cartoon characters/celebrities/puppets

<p>As an initial matter, the area of law that you need to be concerned about is trademark law and perhaps the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights" rel="nofollow">right of publicity</a>.  Copyright law does not apply because you can't copyright a name.  For example, the name "Mickey Mouse" is a trademark but is not copyrighted.  The appearance of Micky Mouse and perhaps the sound of his voice is copyrighted, but it sounds like you are not using those things.</p>

<p>Beyond that, however, I'm not sure of what you can do legally.  If all the characters in your game were Disney characters, then I think you would likely have a legal problem.  If the characters come from all over the place, then I would think that you should probably be ok.  I doubt that Trivial Pursuit got licenses for any character they mention in a question or answer.</p>
