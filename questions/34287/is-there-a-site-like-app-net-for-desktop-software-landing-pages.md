I have an app in the Mac App Store and I need a landing page for it.  The web site app.net provides simple, attractive templates home pages for mobile sites.

The application I've written is called Slicer and the "home-made" landing page for it is:

http://allsysemsgrow.com/slicer

The page I made for it is okay, but not as attractive or professional as others, such as Alfred http://alfredapp.com

Is there something like app.net that provides simple, attractive templates for Desktop apps? (Would support screenshots, youtube clips, links, buttons, text, etc)

There's plenty of great theme sites out there, such as http://themeforest.net/ where you'll be able to find a great looking theme from less than fifty bucks.
