I have people with me (US Citizens) who are willing to help me establishing this company.So i am wondering now what do i need to do (legally) in order to start this company. I will be founder of the company, so what visa do i need or what procedures do i need to perform ?

Thanks

My way: 

 1. Find a partner
 2. Form a C-corp (not LLC, no S-corp)
 3. Make your partner a president, accountant and whatever else required there. 
 4. You must be ONLY a shareholder, nothing else. You must NOT hold any position in the company and you can NOT get any salary
 5. Do whatever you want after that: development, marketing, sales, just don't violate (4).

That's pretty much it. From what I learned that's the only **safe** way to start a company in the US if you don't have a green card/citizenship.

I started a company on my own when I was on OPT. I think it's a good option to get OPT and start the company. Once you register the company you can apply for e-verify. After you have been approved for e-verify you can extend your OPT(STEM extension) or get a H1B sponsorship through your company. I am not sure but one of friend got a L-1 visa(but he has company registered in India and his US firm is a subsidiary of his Indian firm).
