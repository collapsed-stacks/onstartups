I'm writing an advisory for a company that's already running for over 4 years. One of the things that came up is that they don't have any written mission statement. What is the modern opinion on this subject? The subject being: is their use still of significant importance to a company or not? 

I read somewhere that leading by example is of more practical use than formulating a mission statement. So now I am searching for some renowned sources to quote on the subject.

<p>One author that comes to mind is Guy Kawasaki; who has published several relevant books on entrepreneurship. I can't fully remember which of his books deals most with mission statements -- I think it is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1591840562" rel="nofollow">"The Art of Start"</a>.</p>

<p>He is dead set against the standard corporate motto. This I like. Instead, he proposes a "mantra". The gist of his proposal goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make meaning. <em>(Loosely, find a major pain point which good people will be passionate about solving.)</em></li>
<li>Make Mantra. <em>(Loosely, create a super-simple <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mantra" rel="nofollow">chant / mantra</a> people can rally around.)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>You can find a <a href="http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/gettingstarted/a/guykawasaki.htm" rel="nofollow">micro-explanation of this here</a>, but you should <em>really</em> read the more comprehensive version in the book.</p>

<p><strong>However, the truly <em>authoritative</em> writer on mission statements was the Dilbert Mission Statement Generator.</strong> Sadly <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/games/career/bin/ms.cgi" rel="nofollow">it no longer exists</a>, but a quick Googling brings back some examples of its writings:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Our challenge is to assertively administrate timely resources and authoritatively integrate enterprise-wide products while promoting personal employee growth.”</li>
<li>"Our challenge is to assertively network economically sound methods of empowerment so that we may continually negotiate performance-based infrastructures."</li>
<li>"Our mission is to continue to conveniently supply seven-habits-conforming data such that we may continue to authoritatively integrate value-added catalysts for change while promoting personal employee growth"</li>
</ul>

<p>TL;DR - mission statements still exist, but many choose to represent this as a manifesto.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong> - from google: <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/" rel="nofollow">mission statement</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it
  universally accessible and useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>vs their philosophy: <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/" rel="nofollow">10 things we know to be true.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Focus on the user and all else will follow.</li>
  <li>It’s best to do one thing really, really well.</li>
  <li>Fast is better than slow.</li>
  <li>Democracy on the web works.</li>
  <li>You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.</li>
  <li>You can make money without doing evil.</li>
  <li>There’s always more information out there.</li>
  <li>The need for information crosses all borders.</li>
  <li>Great just isn’t good enough.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>We all have heard the phrase "do no evil" and "google" but rarely hear about their mission statement.</p>

<p><strong>Another example:</strong> "philosophy" statement / mission statement:  <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/about/mission" rel="nofollow">SEOmoz's TAGFREE</a> </p>

<p>In the internet space, many companies point towards "beliefs" more than the mission statement. </p>

It's a great question, that so many companies get wrong.  

Peter Drucker, deceased legendary management author since the '40s, has the most notable insights on the subject:

> 
> A mission statement has to be operational, otherwise it's just good
> intentions.  A mission statement has to focus on what the institution
> really tries to do and then do it so that everybody in the
> organization can say, This is *my* contribution to the goal.
> 
> So you need three things: opportunities, competence, and commitment. 
> Every mission statement, believe me, has to reflect all three or it
> will fall down on what is its ultimate goal, its ultimate purpose and
> final test.  It will not mobilize the human resources of the
> organization for getting the right things done.
> 
> "It's our mission to give assurance to the afflicted"  --hospital
> emergency room
> 
> "To help girls grow into proud, self-confident, and self-respecting
> young women"  --Girl Scouts
> 
> "Make citizens out of the rejected" --Salvation Army
> 
> "Make gentlemen out of savages." --Arnold of Rugby, the greatest
> English educator of the nineteenth century, who created the english
> public school.
> 
> "Be the informed and responsible buyer for the American Family" --
> Sears

*Drucker advocates, "an organization's mission statement should fit on a T-shirt".  Also, It's funny to hear Guy Kawasaki talk about the common procedure for creating a common mission statement.  'A company takes it's leadership to a retreat where they do trust falls and ropes courses with people they don't like, and develop a mission statement based around everyone agreeing to broad watered down nice sounding statements.'

Ahh, the elusive mission statement. 

I come out of an academic background that loves mission statements. It is called Organizational Development. OD Consultants believe that a company must have a clear mission statement. We could discuss for a long time how this emerged in the context of organization developmental with roots in Military efficiency and effectiveness -- but then we would be continuing to provide this topic far more time that it deserves.

So I am not a 'great published writer" with a book you can quote and provide to your client -- but I will tell you this from personal experience as an orgnaizational development consultant:

**There is absolutely no correlation between coherent mission statement and success**. And if (when) I am ever wealthy (again) I will personnaly refund all my clients I every accepted money from in the bullshit exercise of developing either a vision or mission statement. 

Until then a simply sorry will have to do. 

**I am sorry to have wasted your time** and organizational resources. I wish we would have focused on understanding your market, your customers, the core value proposition you offered, how you were going to deliver that propsition, and  provide a positive return to your owners and stakeholders. 

If you must try this: To deliver real value to our customers in manner that builds value for our owners. You can polish it a little to personalize it if you want. 

Then, get back to work.
