I'm looking for a website that has all the tools and resources one might need to start a company. Anything from business plan templates to legal docs to reviews on potential vendors (e.g. who should I use to make sure my emails to consumers get delivered).

I know these things exist in pieces (so please don't refer me to those), but I am really looking for recommendations on websites that cater to start-ups and any tools and resources they may need throughout their early stages.

Thanks!

<p>As others have stated, there is no one stop shop. There are just too many things you need to know, and do, for any one place to have expertise in all the areas. </p>

<p>The closest thing I can think of is Bob Walsh's <a href="http://startuptodo.com/session/new" rel="nofollow">StartupToDo</a>. It's not a free service. Bob has very little information visible to the public, and I've never participated in the program, but I have heard good things about it. My understanding is that the program provides you with lots of checklists of things to do for just about everything you can think of. However, I don't think they have templates or legal documents. I know some of the other members here have participated in this program in the past, hopefully they can share more with you.</p>

<p>Take a look at this question: <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/3023/is-startuptodo-com-worth-it">Is StartUpToDo.com worth it?</a></p>

<p>Also take a look at this question: <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/3719/is-micropreneur-academy-worth-it">Is Micropreneur Academy worth it?</a>. The Micropreneur Academy is also a paid service similar to StartupToDo. It is hosted by Rob Walling of softwarebyrob.com</p>

The needs of a startup are so large and diverse, that it is practically impossible to get them as a one size fits all solution.

I have never seen a one stop shop for everything you could possibly want to start a business, I think the reason is that each business can vary to a high degree, and that the business who offer services and products to business focus on a niche.

The closest thing I can think of is Microsoft.  If you are a new business try to sign up for their Bizspark program.  Microsoft is the only company I know that has spread out with so many offerings, including hosted exchange, books, training, etc. I think windows.live.domains now do domain registrations.  But even they don't have all your bases covered.

It might be a good thing to not have all your eggs in one basket.

Check out The Entrepreneurs School (http://www.theentrepreneurschool.com/). The site was launched by two entrepreneurs that have both acted as professors of entrepreneurial studies as well. One, Chris Hanks is currently the Director of Entrepreneurship at the U of Georiga. They've also just written a book, School for Startups, that reached #10 in business on Amazon. 

The goal of their site is to give you all the tools you need, but there are fees for some of the stuff. Monthly fees to access certain templates, and I think, time with them. Though I think the fees are pretty reasonable ($30/month).
