I have tried for years to find a business partner to work with - nothing has worked out.  In the past year I wrote a plan by myself and was accepted to a local incubator.  While I have an idea and vision - I have no cash and no developers. 

Thus far the incubator will help start the company for a % in the company.  In addition they have a team of developers who will work on some of the development.  We are stuck at how to structure the equity for development piece.  Ideally if all goes well we will keep working together - but I feel like we are writing a pre-nuptial agreement.  What are some ways to structure this development for equity? 
- should the my company own all of the technology
- another suggestion was we set up a 2nd entity for developing the software and technology that has a different equity split.

In the event that things don't work out - and I need to or want to seek outside investment I want to make  sure that I have not given away so much equity that I am no longer attractive to investment.

Any ideas thoughts or links to other post on this would be greatly appreciated.

Traditionally, the company would own the IP and the developers would be working for equity. It's just cleaner that way when you want to go raise more money.

You kinda are writing a pre-nup. All of this legal and contract stuff is for when things go wrong. If everything goes right and people are reasonable, then none of this is necessary. Unfortunately, that is rare.

In terms of your deal, I would advise you to talk with a lawyer who specializes in startups.

As for the equity split, there are several ways you can handle it. They are:

* Hours worked converts to a % equity up to a cap
* A pool is set aside for the developers
* You treat the work done as a bridge loan to a real financing round. That way, you don't set a price.
* You issue founders stock and have a claw back clause if you don't reach certain milestones.

What you really need to be careful of is what you are getting for your equity. You want some work done in a timely manner and that should be reflected in the deal. In fact, everyone should want that because that means the idea is getting worked on.
