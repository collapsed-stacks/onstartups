So I started a small business offering a service that is provided through-out the month and is billed monthly. This service could be stopped at any point, but I want to make sure the following are clear between us and our client:

- Price
- Deliverables and when to expect them
- What is included and what is not
- Payment schedule


What type of contract should I use? Do I have to use a contract, or any document with a signature at the end will be good enough?

You definitely want a contract.  Just about any document with a signature at the end constitutes a contract, but in addition to the things you mention in your question you should disclaim warranties and have a limitation of liability clause.

If you have a tight budget, you can do this on your own and don't need a lawyer.  Find 3-4 contracts from companies that provide similar services and adapt them to your needs.  You should avoid copying paragraphs exactly, but it is pretty easy to reword them so that they are different.
