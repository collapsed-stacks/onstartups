<p>so I have a startup that provides an online SaaS solution. We are not shipping any items, so payments do not require a shipping address. For collecting taxes in the states that my company has offices (MA and CA), is tax simply based on the billing address, or do I have to also ask for a shipping address and base the sales tax off of that?</p>

<p>Tax is a tricky matter, and it gets even more tricky in the USA, where local state taxes apply.</p>

<p>You would be best advised by a lawyer and you should speak to the lawyer about a possible solution or structuring where you may be able to register your business in a state like Delaware, where there is practically no state taxes, so that you might be able to save on paying excessive state taxes (which CA has).</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken, I also don't think there was a sales tax for online selling before, but I think this has changed.</p>
