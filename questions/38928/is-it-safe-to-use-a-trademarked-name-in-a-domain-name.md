When selling products related to an established brand such as Kindle, Apple, Nokia, could you get into legal trouble by using their name in your domain/business name? For example www.-----kindle.com, www.Apple----.com.

Absolutely you could get into trouble, and you wouldn't have much of a defense, either.  The trademark specifically protects the company's right to use that name for commercial purposes.  Selling products is a commercial purpose.  You won't find websites such as best-deals-on-sony.com for precisely that reason.
