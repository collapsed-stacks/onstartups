I have constructed a new personal information management system. It allows to organize personal matters in a new way. Can I file a patent to European Union? I live in Germany.

I think you actually need a lawyer for this question. But I want to suggest you Wikipedia:
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent

And of course the Deutsche Patentamt:
http://www.dpma.de/patent/index.html

To my knowledge you can only patent "something" which can be executed. For example, ideas cannot be patented. If you have the idea for a machine which should divide apples without any plans how - no chance. But if you a concrete plan for that machine and an engineer can execute it, then you can patent it.

In your case I would say it is pretty difficult to say. Reason: software patents are not protectable in the EU (to my knowledge). And my guess is your system will rely on software. Maybe it is different for what you have described, but I can't tell. You actually need an expert here.

Here is another link which might help you:
