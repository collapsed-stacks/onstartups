Are there any sites that dissects a company's annual report as well as discuss its strategy, SWOT etc?  If there is such a site, it will be a good opportunity for us to enhance our understanding of the market landscape and better identify the niche.

I'm not sure if I understand it right what you are looking for, so if you are looking for a site which shows the results of SWOT-Analysis for companies then you might look at

http://www.freeswotanalysis.com/

If you want to create your own SWOT-Analysis (even based on a Questionaire) take a look at my site at

Hope this helps a bit.

<p>If its a public company, then there are standard sections that one can gather information on. 10-Q's have sections that cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition / results of operations</li>
<li>Quantitative / qualitative disclosures about market risk</li>
</ul>

<p>both good (albeit unaudited) views on the market condition. </p>
