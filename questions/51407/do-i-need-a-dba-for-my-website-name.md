<p>I have registered a LLC and want to know if I need a DBA for my website name.</p>

<p>For example, if I registered the name "XYZ LLC", do I need a DBA to use the website "www.XYZ.com"?</p>

<p>Not really<br>
You may need a fictitious name in your state, but mostly it's for when you do business documents, checks, name placements, etc with the fictitious name. A URL is not in itself a fictitious name.<br>
Example would be: My Flower Shop LLC operating Flowers R US</p>
