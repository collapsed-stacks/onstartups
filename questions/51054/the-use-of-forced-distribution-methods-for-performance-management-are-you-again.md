<p>I am wondering if I should implement this in my company later on, but I found some controversial informations on internet about this. What do you think about forced distribution methods?</p>

<p>I believe it is tough enough to hire competent people and grow a startup from concept to execution to profitability. Adding / considering a punitive ranking system like this seems quite premature - and if implemented early, forget about getting anyone to join.  When your company in in the black and making 100M +, perhaps this will be a consideration.  </p>
