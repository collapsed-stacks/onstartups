Where can I purchase a professional looking, Web 2.0 styled template for a subscription service website. I'd need the PSD, the HTML, images and the styles.

www.themeforest.net under the HTML templates category.  Also CSShub is a good resource.  You will want to select a template that fits your vision and can accommodate your app's structure.  Probably want to personalize it a bit too, making minor changes.

In the past i have blended a few themeforest templates together, taking footer from one, layout from another.  It gives you a quick head-start.

Best of luck.

<p>I've been looking for a SaaS styled template for my WordPress website, and unfortunately I haven't found a lot of choices. </p>

<p>As Franky mentioned, Theme Forest has a few. Here's a <a href="http://themeforest.net/searches?term=saas&amp;type=files" rel="nofollow">direct link</a> to the Theme Forest SaaS templates. It looks like there are about 6 templates that fit your criteria - probably less when you look at them in detail. </p>

<p>I also found <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/29/where-can-i-download-wordpress-themes-from">this question</a> on the WordPress StackExchange site that lists the best sites for WordPress themes. It's worth a look even if you're not looking for WP themes, because not all the sites listed are WP specific (Theme Forest for example).</p>

<p>If you happen to find good SaaS templates, please come back and let us know. </p>

If you are open to modify some HTML and PHP code as well as some graphics, you may want to consider free themes such as:

Templates are horrible. The HTML/CSS can be quite bad. I've seen horrible work out of well-known places like TemplateMonster. Those sites don't really vet the work they resell.

Also, depending on your target audience, they may notice it is a template... and "the interwebs" can turn it into a minor PR disaster.

Find and work with local talent. Not only do you get what you need, you'll likely need to do updates/tweaks and you will have started a hopefully good relationship with a good individual or company.
