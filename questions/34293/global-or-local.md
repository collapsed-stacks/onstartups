I want to know in detail that if I publish a site in India,will it be globally available or will it be  seen only in India? Again if it is available locally,what  I should do to make it  available globally?

If you put it on a public accessible webserver it is globally available.
You need to think about search engine optimization or on several country restrictions (for example, Chinas great firewall). Anyway, if online, it is avail local and global. If you don't put it to search engines it is likely that only few people find the way to your site.

Is this what you wanted to know? You probably need to rephrase your question.
