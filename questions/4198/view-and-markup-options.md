Greetings,

I am looking for options on reasonably priced (or free / open source) view and markup software that can be integrated into an existing web based, product development software. I know this is an extremely open ended question, but I'd love to hear some feedback from folks that have used or experimented with ANY kind of open source or plug-in solution that allows view and markup of product images and can be integrated into an existing open source or proprietary solution. What are the pro's and con's of the solutions you've considered or implemented?

If you are aware, and can elaborate on the technological platform and requirements of the solution, it would be icing on the cake! Thanks for your time!

Best regards,
JZ199

<p>Do you mean a wysiwyg textarea editor ?</p>

<p>If so, I've used both <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/" rel="nofollow">TinyMCE</a> and <a href="http://ckeditor.com/" rel="nofollow">CKEditor</a> with success. </p>

<p>Yahoo has a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/" rel="nofollow">free one</a> which is pretty complete. If you want one similar to what you are using now on this site see: <a href="http://github.com/derobins/wmd" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/derobins/wmd</a></p>
