<p>I am wondering how much equity (in percentage) should I demand for a co-founder CTO position in a start-up which opened 7 months ago?</p>

<p>Here are some details on the start-up:
= The main founder is the CEO and the brain behind the idea.
- There is already R&amp;D director which works for options.
- They have a working prototype.
- They made contact with VC although the VC asked for another impressive co-founder to invest (I have the proper experience to be that co-founder)
- Currently there are some potential customers although no deal has been signed yet.</p>

<p>I have been asked to say how much equity I want to join.</p>

<p>Appreciate your opinion.</p>

<p>This is very vague. It depends on many parameters that we don't know such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>your expected workload (especially compared to the other cofounders)</li>
<li>your role is only "to be the third that the investor wants to see" or you bring something more to the company?</li>
<li>how specific your contribution is - could they find easily someone else than you?</li>
<li>would it be your main source of revenues or just a side project?</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Answer these questions for you and for the two other co-founders and make the comparison. <strong>In itself it's easy: the distribution of the equity should correspond to the distribution of contributions</strong> (work, cash, skills, knowledge, cash, potential customers, cotacts, opportunities,...) <strong>of each of co-founders.</strong></p>
