(Assuming you're in the US, because you didn't mention jurisdiction)

No, if the "check-the-box" election is to treat the LLC as a disregarded entity. It becomes the basis of the contributor in the partnership. If elected to treat the LLC as a corporation, tax consequences may be more complicated.

Talk to a local tax adviser.
