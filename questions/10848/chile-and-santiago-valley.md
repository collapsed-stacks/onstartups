Inspired by [Vivek Wadhwa's post on TechCrunch][1], I've spend the last 12 hours researching Chile and thinking about moving to Santiago.

Chile is *really* appealing to me right now. One thing I could find barely any info on, though, is the "entrepreneur sponsorship".

InvestChile.com (the government's site) is completely pathetic with virtually zero useful information or guidance. The site doesn't even work without "www."!

Does anyone have good information about Chile? Thanks.

Try saving some money, polishing your Spanish and then taking an extended leave from your current job to spend some months there in July when it's winter to do an internship in a software company.

That applies to many countries you could be curious about.

<p>Here's <a href="http://steveblank.com/2011/01/04/creating-the-next-silicon-valley-%E2%80%93-the-chilean-experiment/" rel="nofollow">another good article</a> on Chile and its startup culture potential. Somewhat like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%C3%B3polis" rel="nofollow">Florianopolis</a> "silicon valley" idea.  </p>

<p>I believe a few more VC / investor types needs to embrace the area - but those who are early adopters may win out.  Only time will tell.</p>

USA International Business Publications, Price Waterhouse Cooper and others publish regularly updated reports on doing business in another country.  

Here's a link to one on Chile that was published in '09: http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Business-Investing-Chile-Guide/dp/143871274X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1294186841&sr=8-1

<p>Consider the <a href="http://www.startupchile.org" rel="nofollow">Startup Chile</a> initiative which gives US 40K (equity free) for new startups based in Chile. Entrepreneurs can be from any country and must apply to participate and later be selected and funded.</p>
