usually VC websites have job boards or openings at associated businesses they are affiliated with in some way.

<p>The focus here is on web-apps and sites.</p>

<p>There are monthly job postings on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" rel="nofollow">Hacker News</a>.  This month, I found:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1857051" rel="nofollow">Who's Hiring</a></li>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1857051" rel="nofollow">Who's Hiring Remote Workers</a></li>

 1. Meet people, build a network.

 2. Find out about your local entrepreneurial community and start going to events.  Then, see #1.

<p>Depending on where you are in this world... check out Meetup.com for startups groups close to you.</p>

<p>For example, if you are in the valley you should check out the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Co-Founders-Wanted-Meetup/" rel="nofollow">Mountain View Co-Founders Meetup</a> and if you are in Austin, TX then the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Co-Founders-Austin" rel="nofollow">Austin Co-Founders Meetup</a>, these are just two examples of great places where you can meet startups and find a job! or even better, become a co-founder.</p>

<p>In general, I believe the best way to find a job at a startup is to go where the startups are, events, user groups, etc... hustle!</p>

I'd look for a local incubator.  Major cities will definitely have them, and smaller ones may even too.  Check for local meetups / groups as well.
