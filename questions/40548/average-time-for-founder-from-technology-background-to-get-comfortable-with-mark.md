**BACKGROUND**

I'm a senior software developer and started my own company last year.  Prior to last year, I worked for a couple of years as a software developer on contract for many companies.  And around last year, I was getting more work than I could handle, so I started hiring and training new software developers to help me out. Today, my company has 3.5 full time developers including myself.

My business is at the point where I should stop coding and focus only on marketing , sales and finding new opportunities.  My team is very capable at development now, so I should just focus on bringing in more work for them.

However, I don't feel comfortable doing marketing and sales because I have absolutely no training in it.  IN the past, happy clients I knew referred more clients to me, so things happened organically...all I had to do was lock myself in a room and code.  But now I want to push for more sales.  The way I'm doing this is I'm networking more.  Networking for me is to find really fun business people, graphics designers and software developers to talk to.  We discuss all things business and technology to inspire each other to do more cool things.  I do this in person and via social media on twitter, linkedin and facebook.

I've been doing this for just 1 month and it yielded one potential client.  The majority of my new projects are still coming in via referral from satisfied clients.

I often question whether my approach to this side of business is correct.  I don't know how to measure the effectiveness of my approach.  With coding, you can measure success with each line of code you write, each module you've researched, and each deadline you meet.  But after 1-2 months of attempting marketing, sales, and creating business opportunity, I still haven't settled on a framework to measure its effectiveness and how it compares to other software development agencies.

**MY QUESTION**

How long does it take the average technology person with an entrepreneurial spirit to feel comfortable doing marketing, sales and generating business opportunities?

I wish I had someone beat this into me. There are 3 things I would suggest to a startup as soon as you can have a professional build a awesome looking website, have a demo video of your product and spend money marketing. The marketing should be knowledge marketing to get more people to your website to understand how you can solve a problem. 

hope this helps.

How long to get comfortable is not a good question. Like your dev projects, when you consistently achieve delivery, and get paid --- that's what marketing should be like as well. And I sense you realise you need to track progress of marketing effort. A good thing.

However, instead of going down the route on how to model what you're going to measure re your marketing effort, I'd say -- assumption here -- you're running a small business. One decent book that you might like is Duct Tape Marketing. Because it's specifically targeted at small-medium business. A bit broader, than deep, which is fine to get a feel of what marketing is about. Most of what he says is spot on -- without the Ph.D analysis -- and can be acted on quickly for SME/SMB.

Digital marketing, on the other hand, is by nature setup to measured. So, no harm trying that from the get go and there's tons of books for this.

Finally, I felt the same about 10 years ago, circa 2002, and that feeling went away after we launched marketing campaigns that worked. Only results matter. So, stick with your gut feel of what's right for your company, but no harm getting a framework in your head as you go-to-market.

All the best.
