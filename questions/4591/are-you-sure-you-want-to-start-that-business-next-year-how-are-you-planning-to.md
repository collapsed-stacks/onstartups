Are you working from home? Is your office in a garage? Is your business plan too big to be executed by you? What plans do you have to change this, if you donâ€™t like the present situation?

Is start-up capital/resource(s) killing your dreams? Now that you neither have start-up capital nor have the up to 25 % of start up what are you going to do?

Or have you decided to wait until you get the right start-up cost? But you have been waiting for many years. Now that you are not an expert in putting up the pieces to make up the documents to raise fund and especially when what you have is 100% less than start-up capital, what will you do? Remember you have little or no prior experience of your new venture; definitely you have little or no hope from financials.

With this entire situation are you now forbidden from starting the business of your dream?
In your opinion what is the best solution to tackle these problems?

Ask for help: a friend, a partner or even an angel investor, and let him be your "coach". It seems to me that the amount of doubt in your head are blocking your options and judgment. 

It's not easy for anyone. We have to find help all the time, find the energy to fight the world and fight against our own disbelief.

A good business  works just as well in a recession as not. You just need to get out of your "comfort zone". So to quote Nike "just do it"

<p>Lots of questions here. :) </p>

<p>But the main one seems to be, "How do you launch a company <em>despite</em> financial limitations and risks?"</p>

<p>I don't have the track record to back this up (yet), but I agree with Jeff. You <em>just do it</em>. Regardless of the real and imagined barriers, it's the founder's job to find a way to make it happen.</p>

<p>In my own life: </p>

<ul>
<li>I recently took a 2nd job to self-fund</li>
<li>I'm selling my early prototypes at a discounted price, while I continue to iterate</li>
<li>I seek out skill exchanges with service providers (save $)</li>
<li>I seek help/advice from my extended network</li>
<li>I always try to envision the end goal - what I'm fighting for.</li>
</ul>

<p>Paul Graham wrote two essays that really capture the essence of this.  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html" rel="nofollow">"Relentlessly Resourceful"</a> referring to the essential quality of a startup founder.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/determination.html" rel="nofollow">"The Anatomy of Determination"</a> describing the need for discipline and willfulness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitely check those out. Hope this helps!</p>

I plan to start a SaaS project next year.
Since I have no money to fund this, I'm presenting the idea to some friends, professionals in some area the project needs and who's work I recommend, and asking them if they want to come along.
Basically the idea is to "fund" the project with everyone's work, that ones that say "yes" will have a share of the project profit (I hope :D).

I have joined so many expert panel blogs and also subscribed for the some financial yahoo groups. So in this way, I tackle easily these kinds of problems.
