We are considering outsourcing some of our web development (Kohana PHP , MySQL) so that we can development multiple streams at the same time, and to keep costs down.

I love like to hear from anyone who has had first hand experience using an offshore development company, preferably someone they are still using, along with recommendations and examples of work.

(please don't use this question as an opportunity to pimp your own agency)

Not sure if you have a preference for an outsourcing region, language, time zone, global certifications etc?

I myself sit in Islamabad and have my headoffices in the UK. But incase you are open to talking to Pakistani IT companies, here is the link for you.

You can look for all the expertize and companies available and speak to them.

On a side note, there are lot and lot of parameters and indicators available using which you can guage the expertize level of an outsourcing partner. I strongly suggest you should know them before making a final decision.

my 2 cents :)

Babar.

Matt O, you can check out my developer: http://www.npediatech.com/ in India, ping me if you want a contact name or you can approach directly. The founder has worked at a couple of very large web companies in the Bay Area and can work on an American schedule and has a very good team, ideal for smaller startups.

You can do outsourcing in many ways using bidding portal and you invite for many professionals across the world. You really need to due-diligence each profile to make sure who is best fit for your need.

We have used these companies for few of our web projects and they are quite reasonable and one of thee company located in Texas.

<p>Not my company, but one for which I have worked for in the past, and continue to do business with, is <a href="http://lichtman.ca" rel="nofollow">Lichtman Consulting Inc</a>. They are located in Toronto, and can provide really good service. The catch is the cost - they are not the cheapest developers around, but they are reliable.</p>

<p>They don't advertise much, because most of their business comes through partnerships and referrals, which is the way the company prefers to operate. They can, however, provide examples of projects which they've worked on, some of which are incredibly complex from a technical perspective.</p>
