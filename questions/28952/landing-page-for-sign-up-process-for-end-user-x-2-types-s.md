The simplest / minimalist sign up processes is usually the best for the end user.  Can you provide some examples.

I need to create a sign up process for 2 types of end users, similar to a job site. Jobseekers and Companies.  

Food for thought for a high quality website design, can you provide websites where 2 types of users could sign up and the sign up process was smooth and involved minimal steps and was not intrusive in your experience.

Currently i am opting for the sign up form with limited fields on landing page; email, name, pass, verify pass etc and then continue the registration on another page. Similar to FB and dating sites (im not a dating site). The Piority is to increase user base (sign up), the success is determined by population of users.


I apreciate your time.

Thanks in advance!

<p>I suspect your best chances of success will be to do a little research. Take a look at your competitors sites, sign up to a few to see what works and what doesn't.</p>

<p>Then, try your ideas out by doing mockups in a tool such at the excellent <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/mockups" rel="nofollow">Balsamiq Mockups</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you could do some user testing using some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping" rel="nofollow">paper prototyping</a>.</p>

<p>This is a <em>very</em> inexpensive way of being able to work through a few iterations of ideas without spending much money!</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

Have you taken a look how THIS site is handling this.  
This is a widely used approach today, at least in sites that target the up-to-date web users.
