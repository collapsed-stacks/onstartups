Make it functional and confortable.

Don't make mistakes as I've seen in a previous place were I've worked a few years ago, like giving the best place by the window to the printer (that's right it was a lucky printer) and staffing people in a corner where the air condicioner didn't even worked properly.

Place people were they will be more confortable and layout furniture in a way it does not cover the windows, make people trip, etc..
You must have in mind requirements like: do we need a meeting room, do we need a secretary to be the first person to be seen when someone comes into the office, etc..

Play a bit with it on a paper prototype (or similar) to see which is the best configuration for all of you.

Go to http://ikea.com and use their room layout program.  It will help you see what will fit and you can look at in a 3D format, so you have an actual viewpoint.  As a small business owner, I find that I am constantly reconfiguring my office based on needs, and using Ikea furniture and their layout has been VERY beneficial because it grows with you and fits into a small business budget.

15 employees is a lot for a roughly 700 to 800 sf space.  Are you using cubicles or desks?  In the 21 square meters space you should be able to seat 5-6 people if you line the desks up against the wall with either the employees facing the wall or facing each other.  That's assuming you are using 5-6 foot desks.  

I have a client that bought furniture at Ikea for all of their software programmers.  Ikea furniture tends to be small and efficient and they were able to buy cool furniture, save money, and squeeze in a lot of employees in each room.
