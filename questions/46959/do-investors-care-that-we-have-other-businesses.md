My partner says that if investor come and ask whether we have other businesses I should say no.

However, I find it strange

 1. While this can be shoehorn into "looking your best" (The other bizs are almost fully managed by my bro) I do not like any kind of insincerity. That includes anything that may be misleading. If something is material I like to tell what it really is and understand others' concern.
 2. The fact is I had many other businesses and successful ones (currently failing but recovering). I am proud of them. They once yielded $5k-$10k per month and can be expanded to $30k per month if I put more attention. Those are not start up in a sense. I am just testing if I can let others manage it. Yet my business partners insisted that I concentrate on this one big thing (which don't make money yet)
 3. Shouldn't they worry about returns, money, etc.
 4. There are so many ways to make quick bucks but my biz partner insist on building this one biz.

What do you think?

Note: 

 1. The other businesses do not compete with this business and most of the time self run (managed by my bro). Once in a while I do need to rescue any one of my biz from critical situation. Actually it happened once that during that critical moment I ended up spending time on the main business pretty much screwing everything.
 2. On the main business, I spent most of my time as programming. In Indonesia, programmer is a $500 a month job.
 3. Of course we have other bizs. Who would have the boldness and capability to start something this big if this is his only nest eggs. I don't think I can hide that.
 4. I don't expect to need money or investors. What we want more is connection and valuation.
 5. This is Indonesia, where extremely good programmers worth $500 per day (I think I should pay my one programmer higher). If I look at how I spend my time, I am simply paid more being a businessman than being a programmer, despite the fact that I too can program well.

First, lying isn't the best policy. If investor(s) discover the truth, your credibility is shot, and investors do exchange notes (check with each other). Your reputation will either be an asset or liability.

Having other businesses isn't a bad thing if the other businesses are staffed with the right people and growing â€” in short, your role is either as investor or member of board of directors. On the other hand, having other businesses are bad if they're struggling because your time and attention may be needed.

Answer depends on what stage your current business is at and how it is executing against its business plan.

Global nomad has a great answer.  In addition, investors will want assurance that your other business will not be a source of competition or divert important resources away from your primary venture. 

It is reasonable for the investor to require a non-competition/solicitation provision as part of their agreement.

All things being equal, investors may prefer that you are 100% focused on their investment.  That said, it is not worth lying about.

I would think so, they figure you are then more distracted and not 110% focused on the business they are investing their hard-earned money in.

I always try to put myself in the investors shoes, I'd recommend it for you as well.
