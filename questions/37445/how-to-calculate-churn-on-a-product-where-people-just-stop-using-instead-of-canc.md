Churn is a nice metric to learn a lot more about your business. But it only works if there is a direct correlation between subscribed users and revenue. How to calculate churn on a product where this is not the case and people stepping to use it is the equivalent of cancelling?

If you are willing to pay some money http://www.kissmetrics.com has a set of "Cohort" reports that can measure your drop-off over time.

You need a usage metric that trends over time. Kinda like an email list. You can see over time how many people subscribe, click or unsubscribe.

Depending on the product, you may want to look at transactions or something else.

If they are still paying you then you got to wonder what's going on. If it's a free service, then you need to figure out how the churn turns to $$ or whatever metric you care about.

You could use "Active (logged on) in last 30 days" or something.
