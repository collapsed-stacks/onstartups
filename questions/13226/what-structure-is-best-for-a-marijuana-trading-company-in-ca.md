If/When California legalizes the recreational use of marijuana, marijuana production companies will begin to pop up.  As someone who would like to start a company which can sell marijuana to distributors in California I am wondering which type of company is best.  Some more details: I want to start this company before the vote to legalize takes place.  Since the sell of marijuana would not be legal yet, I want the company to be a trading company which could trade numerous goods.  This will allow me to talk to prospective clients about the possibility of a business relationship if the vote is to pass.  I don't see a huge amount of liability if we are selling to distributors, but I am also new to starting a business so I could easily make a mistake because I am not familiar.

My main goal right now is to start the entity, so that I can be prepared on day 1 to sell/trade marijuana which is why my questions is about what entity/structure is best.

I understand this might be a controversial topic, and I respect everyone's opinion and do not wish to offend anyone, but I honestly am not looking for information on the ethics behind a business of this type.  I have had my internal debate about the right and wrong of this, and I don't wish to hash it out here.  (no pun intended.)

Thanks in advance

This seems to be a bit out of date but why not simply start as a supplier to the Medical Marijuana shops?  Converting and Expanding the business is much easier then starting one from scratch especially if you are going head to head with businesses like the one I just described.

No, it is not. The moment they legalize it there is simply no doscussion worth doing here. BEFORE they legalize it - there is also NO discussion for you preparing for a legalization. The rest is for hippocrites.

Generally, this is a normal trading busienss. Not sure you will see a market for it (could be the shops will try buying direct or online from producers).

You can start that pretty much in any legal form - you should definitely talk to a lawyer / accountant for that to check requirements. You also should prepare for possible legal requirements as part of the bill. Maybe the trading will be somehow restricted - so you better are prepared.

You can't start an entity without it being legal first.
