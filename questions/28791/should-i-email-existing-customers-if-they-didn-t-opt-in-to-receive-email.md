I have about 2000 users of my first product. When they bought (over the past 3 years), I didn't have any checkbox on my order page asking if they wanted to receive notifications or updates from my business. I now find myself shipping product number 2, and want to tell my users of product 1 about it, and offer them a discount on the sale price.

My question: Is it legal for me to email them about product number 2 in the absence of explicit permission to email them. Or is my customer contact list now worthless to me?

**Update:**  Just thought I'd give an update. I took the advice given and emailed all 2000 users, with the appropriate 'unsubscribe' links and full contact info. Response was great: no one complained about receiving the email, new website's been busy for 2 days, and sales have been coming in as a result. Very positive result.

 - Absolutely

You have a business relation with them. It's possible you will need to send out product updates, security alerts, etc.  AS WELL as other marketing, cross-selling, up-selling promotions.  

The key is to ensure you have an opt-out of your emails to them. I would just put them on your mailing list and just make sure they have a way to get off. You will be in compliance as long as you follow the other CAN SPAM regulations such as: Including your business name, address, contact information, opt-out option in every email.

It is ok - especialyl if yuo do it ONCE and ONLY once and with an opt in.

All this opt in / opt out to a LARGE degree is for pure non-solicitated communication, legally. Heck, if you find a critical bug security wise in your product you even have a legal obligation to inform them if you knwo about them.

As they bought something, there obviously is a specific amount of interest and legal busienss you have with them. This takes out most anti spam rules.

I would put in a one time mailing with an opt in link for regular updates.

This depends where you business is located. If you are in the EU then you risk a â‚¬10,000 fine per email sent.

Privacy is everything and costs nothing

It is a good idea to put on your terms and conditions that any new clients would also be automatically subscribed to ongoing email marketing used by the company.
