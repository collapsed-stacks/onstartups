I have a couple of design ideas for travel bags in a niche market. As it happens, I have a cousin that has worked for Dakine, North Face and a few other companies designing outdoor wear and packs, and now runs his own design business with a line of his own packs.

How would I approach him? I have the ideas/design concept, but he has the capability of getting them on paper, as well as the nuts/bolts of taking it from paper to production. Do I just outline it, and let him tell me what an acceptable structure or price would be, or is there another avenue I should be considering?

Let's assume for a moment that this person is **not** your cousin. How would you approach this problem then? Would you contact only **one** firm with no idea of what to do? Or would you research what you wanted done and then submit a proposal to many design firms?

It seems the unspoken wish here is for a discount on these services from your cousin. If that's what you want then be upfront about it. But remember, you often get what you pay for.
