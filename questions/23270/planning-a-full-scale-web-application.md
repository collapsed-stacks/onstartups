I've been wanting to build a full scale CMS application that will target certain career workflows but the obstacle that has been in my path is that I would need to sit down and fully learn the career in order to map out and build the application that will help or guide employers already in the environment.

This isn't so much a programming question but based on some of your experiences what are some of the things I need to think about before starting on the application?

For me here are a few questions I have asked myself:

1. what is the demand for this application?
2. who is the target audience?
3. what is it that I need to learn?
4. is it really worth the time spent on learning?
5. will it cost money and how much?
6. how will the service be provided to the client?
7. Does this application already exist? If yes what features does it have and not have
8. what are clients really looking for in this application that they cannot find.

I understand that most of this can be common sense but having some of your input from your own experience can help with questions I probably didn't even think about.

I will be using php5 and mysql since that is what I already know.

My question basically is, if you were to build a web application say a CMS for bookkeeping and you had no idea on the subject and that it was a very hot project, what would you ask yourself? (that is for example)

The short answer is don't do it.  If you don't have good domain experience then you're likely to miss key features and functionality that is required.  Speculatively building web applications without specifications and requirements from somebody that knows the workflow very well is likely to end in tears.

For a longer answer, start with what you know or otherwise, find someone that does know a domain and (importantly) thinks there is a gap to fill.  

You might start by networking and contacting small companies that don't have the resource or skill to build a bespoke web application - convince them that for very low risk they will get a working system that will solve problem X or improve efficiencies in a certain area.  You need to start talking to people.  The alternative is that you shut yourself away for months building something that nobody will want to use or buy.

**Either have market expertise in the target market of your proposed start-up -- or partner to get it.** 

And in direct response to this question: 

> you were to build a web application say
> a CMS for bookkeeping and you had no
> idea on the subject and that it was a
> very hot project, what would you ask
> yourself? (that is for example)

I would ask myself "Is this really the best use of my talents and skills? Will this be the best chance of creating a viable start-up? How do I even know this is a very hot project if I have no idea on the subject? The bookkeeping space is crowded -- what is my unique value proposition that will allow me to bust through? The CMS space is crowded -- what is my unique value proposition that will allow me to bust through?

And then I would go and find a client that knew their market and paid use my PHP/MySQL skills to develop an application then needed. And then when they were happy I would go and find all the other companies just like that client who needed the same solution. Then I would be an expert in that space.
