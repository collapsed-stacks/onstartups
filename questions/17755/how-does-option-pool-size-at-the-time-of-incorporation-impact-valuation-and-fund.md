<p>I recently touched on this subject <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/17648/how-much-in-stock-options-should-we-offer-new-employees/17653#17653">here</a>. Read up on the links there. You may also want to read <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/08/term-sheet-series-wrap-up.html" rel="nofollow">Brad Feld's Term Sheet series</a>, especially the Employee Pool post, to learn more about funding and investor terms.</p>

<p>In short, it doesn't. But it impacts your dilution, not the investors. The option pool gets diluted just as any stock down the run when emitting new stock.</p>

<p>One could argue however, that depending on your investors view, future investors views, and your ability to attract great talent with stock, that it has an indirect impact on valuation.</p>
