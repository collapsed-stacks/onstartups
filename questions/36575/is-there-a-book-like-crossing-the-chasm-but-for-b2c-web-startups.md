I know of crossing the chasm, i haven't read it but from what im aware its not focused on web startups of the B2C type.

So is there a book that is?

OK, I need to do an update, and I have been trying to avoid the responsibility because I am evangelizing a new book, Escape Velocity, which is about rejuvenating established franchises, not crossing the chasm with new ones.  But I take it I cannot get off the hook, so I will do this.

In the meantime, I do think the basis of a B2C start up is something we are calling the 4 Gears model, and there is a video preso on this on my YouTube site--the one for the Digital Media conference given a Berkeley--that could give you a head start.  http://www.youtube.com/geoffreyamoore

Ok, I have been reading and would recommenced "Four Steps To The Epiphany". Focusing on pure start up strategy this may be the one for you. 

Good Luck

Check out following books
1) "What Customers Want: Using Outcome-Driven Innovation to Create Breakthrough Products and Services" by Anthony Ulwick. If you are new to market research or product innovation, this book is practical and easy to read and I recommend it.

2) "Flip the Funnel: How to Use Existing Customers to Gain New Ones" by Joseph Jaffe
By creating a more memorable customer experience and acknowledging your clients, you set the stage for increased customer loyalty -- and profits.

Geoffrey Moore's http://www.geoffreyamoore.com original book Crossing the Chasm is a classic.  Here is a video of it applying to a customer market.  It is narrated by Geoffrey Moore http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izP5n1SBEaI
