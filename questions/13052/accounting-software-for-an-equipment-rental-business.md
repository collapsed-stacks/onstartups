## Accounting software for an equipment rental business?

I'm starting an audio equipment rental shop, where I build & rent assemblies from parts and rent a package as the job requires. Assemblies & packages thereof are dynamic. Parts &/or assemblies could be 'cross-rented' to or from 'competitors' as need be.

I'm looking for an accounting package that can handle the changing product & doesn't require accounting 'gymnastics' to handle stocks coming back after they go out.

I hear so much talk about QuickBooks, and I cringe inside every time I hear of their popularity.
A few years back, I worked at a shop who was using QuickBooks Enterprise, the year Intuit changed from their proprietary database to the more common one, maybe SQL- I don't recall.

All I remember about QuickBooks was that it was what made us make our customers wait, while we were on the phone with them. Everything would end up in the 'Notes' field, and it was so bad that even in the version we upgraded to, we would reach the notes field's character limit and had to have duplicate customer accounts just for the extra notes field to type in.
The customers who gave us the most business- exactly the ones who shouldn't have been kept waiting- had the longest wait, since their info was dumped into notes like everyone else, with the added delays of us switching back & forth with them being split up.
I always thought there must be a better way to organize all that wound up there. Now I imagine that's what CRM is for, although I've never used any.

This and the fact that QuickBooks really isn't made for renting has me wanting to steer clear.

I also would like to integrate scheduling, maintenance & pre/post-job QC checklists. Barcoding's not as important so early as it will be later, however I don't want a major migration when it does become necessary.
Ideally, what I choose now will allow for future integration with functions such as online scheduling through a customer portal, although I don't have much more than a 1-page website so far.

I'm not so familiar with metrics to know what features are of value & which aren't- I imagine hindsight will be a factor in that area.

Is anyone aware of software to manage such things, that doesn't cost an arm & a leg?
What I'm finding on Google seems either relatively primitive, with basic asset tracking or super-expensive. One was even a virus, so I'm hoping to hear from people here about something somewhat reputable.

Thanks in advance.

Why don't you have it built?  You seem to have very specific requirements and a long rant against Quickbooks, which, to be fair to QB is not really appropriate as it was not intended to be a glorified library rental tracker.  I do suppose though that it would have been simple to write a plug-in for QB to do what you want.

You should start with a list of requirements and then see if someone can build it for you.

I would recommend Alert Easy Pro. 

I own a audio/visual rental company and their software was easy to integrate and works perfectly for us for over 6 years now. 

I also hear point of rental and solutions by computer are good as well, although i haven't tried them myself. 

By all of them offer a free trial, so it's good to shop around.

It sounds like you're asking for something very specific. My recommendation would be to look into the Google Apps Marketplace, where you can create a "grab bag" of different, integrated apps that would meet all of your different needs. I don't think something exactly like what you are looking for exists, but with the Google Apps Marketplace you can customize the various features that you need by combining a package of different applications.

I work for WorkingPoint, which has a lot of the features you are looking for (for example being really quick and easy to use) but not all of them. We decided to join the app marketplace for just that reason, so that our specialized businesses who needed something very specific and robust could "build" a package that meets all of their needs. Small Businesses tend to be so diverse in their needs (and in their businesses!) so this is what I usually recommend to people looking for something more complex or unique than what I know exists on the market.
