I have a business iPhone development proposition to someone who is willing to partner. No pay is offered up front, we would both be sacrificing our time to build something big - the rewards are there for the taking.

To the right candidate or candidates, I will offer a significant share of the companies' profits on this project. I will fully disclose the details of these applications and the share you will receive once I have chosen the right person(s) for my team. 

I am open to online collaboration if the right team is formed.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

I am interested in developing iPhone applications. Do let me know how we can go from here. I am a software developer in the US and am new to iPhone app development. There is a lot for me to learn in this process and I am eager to kick start this learning and the best way is to be a part of a good product/project development as a contributor.

You may kindly contact me through email at shanky.hwr@gmail.com

Thanks and regards,
-Shashank
