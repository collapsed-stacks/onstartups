Last year I opened a single-member LLC. This is my first year doing the business taxes.

Naturally, I have lost my EIN. (This isn't exactly true; I have a hardcopy, but I've recently moved and am still unpacking boxes. Ouch.)

I know I have a PDF of the EIN, but I don't know, exactly, where I've saved it. I'm trying to avoid calling the IRS to ask them to look it up if I can.

So: Does anyone know the name of the PDF file that the IRS sends you (or lets you download) after applying for an EIN online? Or the email address from which they send notifications? What should I search for (file names, email addresses, etc?)

<p>They don't email you the PDF. They create it on the spot, and allow you to save it. So, I wouldn't waste my time searching for an IRS email. Here's what the confirmation page looks like:</p>

<p>I don't remember the original name of the EIN PDF. It may be "EIN Confirmation Letter", as stated on the confirmation page. If that's not it, it may be something random. If it's a random name odds are you probably renamed it to something more meaningful to you. Try searching for 'EIN', if you haven't already. Or possibly your startup name.</p>

<p>If you don't have any luck with any of those, I would just call the IRS. You'll <em>hopefully</em> have your answer in minutes. I can't think of a reason why you would want to avoid that. My EIN document says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For assistance you may call us at: 1-800-829-4933</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, if you <em>really</em> don't want to call the IRS, if you opened a business bank account, you can contact them. You would have needed to provide them with an EIN to open a business bank account. Or contact any other entity you may have provided your EIN to.</p>
