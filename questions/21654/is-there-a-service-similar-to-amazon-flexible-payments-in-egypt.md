Particularly, is there a payments service which will allow me to reserve funds on a customerâ€™s credit card and settle these funds later?

You could look into paypal, moneybookers, etc.  But your best bet is to find an egyptian bank that is hooked into the VISA MC AMEX networks.   They will offer you a true merchant account which usually has lower fees, and more flexibility in matters such as "* authorizations*
