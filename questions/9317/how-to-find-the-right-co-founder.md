I am looking for a technology co-founder.  I have been able to find a couple of good posts browsing this site that help point me in the right direction:  

- http://greenhornconnect.com/blog/kabir-hemrajani-5-tips-finding-technical-co-founder

- http://venturehacks.com/articles/pick-cofounder

- Courtesy of comment elsewhere by Jay Neely: "And there's now a Google doc co-founder wishlist by Hacker News with 140 and growing people seeking co-founders: <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AgCvDTyBjHdOdDFfMENqeWVGNVFxTXdnaDZBRkd0cUE&hl=en">spreadsheets.google.com/â€¦</a>"

Can anyone provide thoughts on how to find the right person or get the word out that I am looking?

<p>You can check out some of the MeetUps and just chat with people. One that's in Silicon Valley is <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Co-Founders-Wanted-Meetup/members/" rel="nofollow">Co-Founders Meetup</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of finding the right one, that depends a lot on your needs. In general, the most important thing is that both of you share the same vision and get along. A superstar A-hole that you hate will make your new startup a living hell and will lead to certain failure.</p>
