I am a techie, now creating few amazing text extraction tech(yes, few of them are world's first related to web data). I am full time into it, and still I do not have any problem going opensource if it can really help analytics get a new direction. 

I am designing website, learning what should I do & what I should not, how to market among other business things. To be honest, I am more in tech than in business, and to be more honest, I just don't want to be in business of selling tech because I think I can create good things but can't sell them (an internal gut feeling).

(By selling, I mean opensource/free as well, it just about people making use of it do things)

What would you do in my place ? Should I overrule my inner thoughts and start focusing on business or should I focus on tech only?  

I am not sure if you have also struggled with this in start years. What is your experience on this?

Try to follow these rules:

1. Think of an idea
2. Shutdown your developer mind completely, go out on a walk and think from a business perspective.
3. How do you think from a Biz perspective? Study the "Business Model Canvas" ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAOzMTLP5s ).
4. Use a software like "mindtree lite", to put your ideas together otherwise they will be one big unordered list of things to do.
5. While you earn your money at your primary employer, start by outsourcing the design/coding parts on websites like fiverr.com and 99designs.com
6. Thoroughly research sites like yelp.com, twitter, etc on how they monetize their content. Remember its all about content after all. Content is King!
