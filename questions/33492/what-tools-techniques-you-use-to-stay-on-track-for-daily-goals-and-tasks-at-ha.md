[Trello] is working very well for me, both in tracking web development and task management for a committee I'm on. It's a bit like an online board for post-it notes, which can move from list to list as they progress, and be ordered as you like for priority. At least, that's how it's envisaged to be used; Trello is extremely process-agnostic, so if you want to customise it, that's very easy. No fees, either.

<p>A new start-up <strong>lift.do</strong>, 
opened its website/phone application only 2 days ago and it does exactly what you describe in your question.
As far as I know it's available on iPhone only for now, I don't have one but I subscribed to the beta test newsletter and I can tell you that it seems pretty powerful!
<a href="http://www.lift.do/" rel="nofollow">check it out</a></p>

<p>Have fun</p>
