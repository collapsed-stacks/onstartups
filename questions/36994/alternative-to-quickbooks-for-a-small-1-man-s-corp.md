I'm currently using a 2009 version of QuickBooks Pro for my S-Corp accounting needs.  They recently sent me a letter "suggesting" I upgrade to the 2012 version ($200+) as many of the features of the 2009 version will no longer work, such as downloading statements from my bank.  

Are there any cheap/free alternatives out there? I've always had the opinion that QuickBooks is completely over the top for a small consulting business like mine.  I will say that I do like these features of QuickBooks and would hope to find them in another package:

 1. Produce Profit and Loss statements and Balance sheets to give to the accountant at end of year.  
 2. Download statements from bank in QuickBook format and automatically enter them into quickbooks.  I still have to go through and pick categories for each item and do some work, but it's a lot easier than entering everyting by hand.
 3. I like the existing categories within Expenses, Income, etc. and the ability to create new ones.

There's tons of features in Quickbooks I don't use (payroll, generating invoices, check generation, etc.)  I don't even do the double-entry bookkeeping.  As far as I'm concerned, it's income, or it's an expense I pay right away (no liabilities).  Even for payroll, I enter it as an expense, and have been told this is fine.  I realize that bigger businesses need all of this but I don't.

I did see some info about GNUCash.  Anyone have experience with this or something else?  Or, if you have an urge to sream out, "Stick with QuickBooks dummy! $250.00 is nothing!  All the free stuff is crap" feel free to do that too.  I can take it :)

I use QuickBooks online and use all the same basic features you mentioned. It costs $40/month so not cheap, but no issues with versions/upgrades either. You can also setup multiple accounts with varied permissions which comes in handy when you want your accountant to access just what he/she needs.

I would suggest QuickBooks Online SimpleStart. It doesn't include Payroll and since you don't need that feature, it doesn't make sense to pay for it.  Also, it is only $12.95/mth with a free 30-day trial.
