What are your favorite websites for learning about or building effective landing pages for online advertising? How should these pages relate to your main site?

I'm a software programming geek that needs to get hip to this marketing thing.

<p>One of the best sites around right is <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>. Here's a resource on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/conversions/">Conversion Rates and Landing Pages</a> turned up by 5 seconds on their site. There are definitely more.</p>

<p>Other great places to look are <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>, The <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2009/07/7-deadly-sins-of-landing-page-design.html">Google Adwords Blog (linked to a useful example)</a>, and of course make use of <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Webmaster Central</a>.</p>

<p>I discovered a great series of articles on <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com" rel="nofollow">Copyblogger</a> shortly after posting this question:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/landing-pages/" rel="nofollow">Landing Pages Turn Traffic into Money</a></p>

<p>The articles include insights on both the wording of the page and its design.</p>

<p>What you want is A/B testing, as Usman mentioned. In essence you build two different versions of the page and measure which one performs better.</p>

<p>My suggestion is the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/siteopt/splash?account=127444&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google Website Optimizer</a>, and related book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470290633" rel="nofollow">Always Be Testing</a></p>

<p>I like Unbounce for landing page tools and tips.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tools -- <a href="http://unbounce.com/" rel="nofollow">http://unbounce.com/</a></li>
<li>Tips -- <a href="http://unbounce.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://unbounce.com/blog/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Their blog is fantastic providing indepth insight and case studies, for example <a href="http://unbounce.com/social-media/how-i-created-a-viral-ebook-landing-page-for-8-using-themeforest-paywithatweet-kissinsights-and-unbounce/" rel="nofollow">Case Study: How I Created a Viral Ebook Landing Page â€“ Using ThemeForest, PayWithATweet, KISSinsights and Unbounce</a></p>
