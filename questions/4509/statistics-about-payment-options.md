I am interested in how much of your sellings are thru Credit card / PayPal / PO / Wire / Fax / Phone / Check / Money Order... Can you, please, tell me first hand what are your payment options selling statistics (in percents) as software uISV? 

Thanks in advance for your answers.

Our payment stats are (approximately): 

1. Check 70%
2. Wire 20%
3. ACH 10%

SaaS product with monthly fees $600-$5000 / mo 

We don't take credit cards or PayPal to keep costs down (those 5% charges really add up!).  Wires (which can also get expensive) are mostly used by international customers where it's not practical to send a check.

It completely depends on the customer.

B2C won't be POs or wires.  B2B still might not be if it's cheap (e.g. $20/month is even under the (American) Federal Government's requirement to issue POs).  If very expensive ($50k+) it's unlikely to ever run a credit card.
