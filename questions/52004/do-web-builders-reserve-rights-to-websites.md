<p>I've been pondering over this one for quite a while now, and after doing some research, nothing appeared to come up. So, my questions is, when you use a website builder like webs, weebly, or other similar sites, do you reserve rights to your website? My guess is a no, as it's mostly the act of the website, but I can also see a yes, as it is your artistic creation. </p>

<p>Here is the Weebly policy:

<p>Consult #7. My guess is others are similar.</p>
