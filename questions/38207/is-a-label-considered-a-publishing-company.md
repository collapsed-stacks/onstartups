I have always been confused as to what the actual function of a Music Label is.  I would think that it is a production company, but it could also been as a publishing company because they are also responsible for producing the end product like CDs, videos, artworkd, etc.  I can't find any clear distinction as to what the difference is.  

I am trying to get this clarified in regard to BMI and ASCAP registration pages when you have to identify yourself as either an artist and publiser.

A music label is not the same as a publishing company even though a music label can own a publishing company. The label is responsible for developing the artists and managing their releases, merchandise, PR etc. The publishing companies job is to manage the intellectual property and rights associated with the music and or lyrics. They make sure monies are collected (not to be confused with a collection society) and also solicit your music and or lyrics to other artists, commercials, etc.

It's not uncommon for an artist to sign with a label and sign with a publishing company that is not part of that recording company the label falls under. They are separate agreements on the part of the artist. For example a singer songwriter may not have a deal as an artist, but can have a publishing deal where the publishing company solicits his or her music to other artists (example Diane Warren).

I'm guessing that an independent / small label will do different things then a large label. But I have always been under the impression that a music label is supposed to be taking care of most aspects of your business.  From getting you studio time, to finding a producer, helping to book venues, PR, marketing, getting your music distributed.  There are also lots of partnerships in the music business, you'll see some artists who might be involved with a couple different companies.  I'm guessing some of the bands who have a lot of success with indie labels go to a large label or large publishing company just for their distribution channels.  

Like the EDM artist Deadmau5 used his own label Mau5trap for US/Canada but hooked up with Virgin for global distribution http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4x4%3D12 - I'm guessing that is also who ended up getting his album in Target.  So it's a complicated landscape and I imagine what all a label does for an artist is fine tuned in the contract. Things like who actually owns the songs. More established artists may be able to keep actual ownership, whereas a new artist signed to a label may relinquish all rights to the work to the Publisher.  I think L.A Reid owned Gaga's stuff but released her and her work from his label Island Def Jam prior to her blowing up into a superstar. 


**Yes, labels are typically the publishing company.**

In the Deadmau5 example I his label would be the publishing company, own all the rights etc, and they used Virgin specifically for distribution.
