We are a small software company in the Virtual Data sharing and management space. We are looking to scale our buisness quickly and believe our next step would be into the software reseller channel.  What I have found is, it is tough to first find the software resellers needed and secondly to find those that are specifically focused in verticals such as oil/gas, BioPharma, Banking, any help out there on how to go about finding these reseller partners is appreciated?

Secondly as we scale our inside sales team is there a commission plan that anyone has experience with (in a subscription model enviornment) that you feel will scale easily as sales grow, and we add more inside salepeople. Help appreciated!!

It's easy!

Many companies list all their resellers on their websites because that's the only way to buy their products.

So, find companies in the verticals in questions -- your competitors are best but similar areas work too -- and look at who the resellers are.  Every one has a phone number they answer because they're expecting to make a sale, so call.

I know nothing about the verticals you mentioned, however, I recommend looking at journals, publications and blogs that talk about oil/gas, BioPharma and Banking to find software resellers that might be advertising on some of those publications.

Also, if you haven't already, create a page in your website with information about your software reseller program and how to sign-up for it.

IMO , if you are targeting enterprise customer, then resellers would make more sense. If you are targeting individual buyers , then , i think Resellers won't be able to give you much advantage. As far as i have seen , resellers do not prefer to sell products that are not complete or products that need more customization, configuration or support. So you can start thinking from these aspects also while trying to partner with resellers.
Which geography are you targeting btw ?

Consider the other software vendors or consultants who work in those verticals.  They should be able to reach your target demographic.  In addition, seek out professional associations and conferences where you can find quality resellers.

Good Luck!

I think you're right that vertical markets are a big stretch, so the right reseller partner(s) could help with growth.

The trap is to assume that resellers are going to be pro-active in marketing. As a rule, they won't. Why would they? 

So your first questions are:

1. What marketing can we do (or what funds will we make available for a partner) to develop leads? 

2. How far are we prepared to go to ensure that resellers are confident they will avoid channel conflict? Will we offer contractual or practical exclusivity, for instance?

3. What are we going to do in our proposition to resellers that will give them confidence to propose our offerings and incentives to close new sales?

Finding active resellers is a matter of research. Look in the trade press and sector publications and you'll soon find who's trumpeting sales success. Look through the vendor partner lists. You don't need to find _all_ of them, just a few good ones. 

Good luck!
