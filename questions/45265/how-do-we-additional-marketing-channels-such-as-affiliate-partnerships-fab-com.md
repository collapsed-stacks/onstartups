We are college students bootstrapping out tech startup the AirBNB cereal box way and have launched a physical product to help with this effort; we sell exclusively through our own website. This product has morphed in to its own business and is showing a lot pf promise; we want to bring some scale into the equation.

We are looking to get on Fab.com's radar and have applied on their website but have had no success. What else can we do to make this possible?

How can we best partner with successful affiliate marketers to - we are willing to pay $10-$20 per sale and have an attractive product. (other than simply opening a CJ or Clickbank account etc.)

What are some other ideas that we can apply to increase our sales?

From what I understand, you have an ecommerce business selling cereal boxes? I found this, http://macfaddenandthorpe.com/airbnb_cereal_boxes.php, is that it? Anyhow, regardless what your business is, retail consumer interaction through social media marketing. Don't do affiliate marketing, it's expensive and never good to treat your customers like cattle. You believe you have a good product so do some point of need marketing and engaging. Make your brand be an "expert" in your field. In today's age, if your product is as good as you think, the multiplier effect in social media will increase your sales and brand loyalty, familiarity, etc.

One technique I found effective is to offer incentives for people to like your Facebook page or follow you on Twitter, for example discounts on your products. You get compound returns from likes especially, not only showing up in user's feeds and being linked to from profile, but the more likes you have the more sophisticated and popular you appear.
