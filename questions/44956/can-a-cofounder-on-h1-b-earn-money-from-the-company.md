<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

me and a friend are planning on investing money to come up with a company. I would not be working for that company, I am only an investor, while my friend who is a us citizen would be my partner. If we start an llc or an inc., when we start making revenue, as a cofounder, can I earn money from the company or since I am on H1 B, would I not be able to earn?
