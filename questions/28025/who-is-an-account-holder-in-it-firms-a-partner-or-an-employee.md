While I used to work with software firms. I have seen few guys who comes in to picture very rarely during important phase of projects meetings who are called as Account holders for that project. Does any one knows who is an account holder? 
Is he an employee or a partner who arranged this project for the company on some profit percentages? 
What is normally the percentage demanded by such guys?

The Account Holder or Account Manager would normally be the person with overall responsibility for managing the relationship with that particular client. Their employment terms and remuneration package will vary wildly depending on the company -- there's no real standard. Some will be salaried employees, some will be employees on commission, some will be partners.
