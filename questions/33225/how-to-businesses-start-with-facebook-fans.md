How do new businesses that are in their startup stages immediedtly have thousands of facebook fans?  Do they hire a PR firm to get this going?

Thanks

One easy but expensive way of doing it is by buying likes and followers... this means buying Facebook ads that are shown to a very targeted Facebook audience... the problem with this is that it can be very expensive.

There is also another way which requires more work but hopefully it has a better return on investment and it is definitely more fun... contests! yes, offer something cool such as a Kindle fire or some other inexpensive popular gadget and ask people to like your facebook page to enter into a contest to win this cool gadget... it really works but you do have to work hard on promoting this. For example, if you don't have many followers in Twitter, you can always ask someone with lots of credibility and followers to tweet about this contest in your behalf, many people will be more than happy to help with this.

Good luck!
