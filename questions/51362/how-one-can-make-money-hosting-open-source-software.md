<p>I have read that for open source software developers, 3 common ways to make money are hosting, consulting, and support. I understand support and consulting but what is hosting?</p>

<p>When I read 'hosting' I think of a hosting site like GoDaddy, but clearly that is not being mentioned here.</p>

<p>Think of sites like wordpress.com or <a href="http://wpengine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wpengine.com/</a> - they provide hosting for wordpress as a service.</p>

<p>Hosting - Basically for SaaS solutions, As Adrian said like Wordpress, or Hadoop Based services. Also hosted software provides Service Level Agreements<br>
Also don't forget extended features, look at Red Hat Linux, MySQL Enterprise, and loads of others</p>

<p><strong>Another approach may be that: you host the project/source code/... that if for free but it generates traffic to your site.</strong> </p>

<p>The developer can thus <strong>earn money by ads on the website or perhaps by affiliate programs</strong> for other paid products that he recommends.</p>

<p>But of course, <strong>the meaning of the "hosting" should be explained by the author of the thought/article you have read</strong>. Because there are many possible interpretations of such a statement.</p>
