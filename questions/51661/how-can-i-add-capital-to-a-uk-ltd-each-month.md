<p>I'm interested in incorporating a UK Limited Company and the second shareholder in this company wants to add money in it each month for the first months to cover all expenses.</p>

<p>This capital must be added each month, not as a one-time, and only for the first months.</p>

<p>How does this work with a UK Ltd. ? Is it possible ?</p>
