I'm looking for a free web based CRM allowing me to contact my clients through that. When interacting with a client, I don't want to use Outlook but a CRM where I could find all the tickets/issues/emails/informations about my client in one same place.

Do you know that ?

Thanks!

<p>If you don't mind installing a server, <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/" rel="nofollow">SugarCRM</a> is the most popular and feature-rich free CRM.</p>

<p>If your needs are very simple, <a href="http://highriseghq.com" rel="nofollow">Highrise</a> is free until you have more than 1 deal and 250 contacts.</p>

<p>Check out Zoho as well (<a href="http://www.zoho.com" rel="nofollow">www.zoho.com</a>)  They have a basic CRM that can be very useful for small startups.  Not to mention a wealth of other web based productivity tools.  Most everything is free until you have higher user requirements.   Just sign up and try the stuff out.  </p>

SugarCRM is by far the best feature-rich free CRM available in my opinion. If you do not want to install it yourself on a server, there are some reasonably priced hosting providers. SugarCRM allows you to send email from the application (good for contacting multiple contacts at one time using email templates) however I am not sure if it allows receiving of emails (my first thought is probably not).

You can try Zimplu CRM, it is very easy to use and it is free for the first 4 users, you only pay starting from the 5th.

<p>You can also look into <a href="http://vtiger.com/" rel="nofollow">Vtiger CRM</a> . There is also a dedicated hosting service (I'm sure there are others too). You can have a look <a href="http://www.vtigerserver.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Two other services to take a look at: <a href="http://batchblue.com" rel="nofollow">BatchBlue</a> (isn't free) and <a href="http://bit.ly/rZALWK" rel="nofollow">Base</a> from <a href="http://www.futuresimple.com/" rel="nofollow">futuresimple.com</a></p>

<p>Both have similar feature sets and might do what you need. </p>
