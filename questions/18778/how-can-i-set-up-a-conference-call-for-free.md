Is there a way to set up a conference call where my partners and I (4 of us) can dial a number and be connected into a conference? Any company name/website link would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

We use both FreeConferenceCall.com and Skype at my company. FreeConferenceCall.com works flawlessly if you just want to use plain old telephones for your call.

We also use Skype and Skype Groups/Conferences. This works great if you want to add video to the mix, but you've got to be in front of your computer and either have built-in mic & speakers or wear a headset.

<p>You wrote "partners" and you -- so they're your friends..? If so, then why not use gratis Skype group calls -- Skype 5.0 even handles <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/features/allfeatures/group-video-calls/" rel="nofollow">group calls with video</a> for up to 3-5 people.</p>

<p>If you must use the plain old telephony system, then state which country you're in...</p>

Either get all parties to use skype or sign up for a 30 day trial of gotomeeting.com and use that, if it's a one-off. If it's not a one-off, you won't find someone offering such a service long-term for free.
