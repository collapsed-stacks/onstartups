I am researching startup opportunities for software products (not web apps). I am especially interested to find software products that cost between 100$ and 1000$ and which make a significant revenue (if this data is available). What I would do with this list is to consider whether these products could be made cloud based, or in other ways be recreated using modern technology.

So far, the best I have come across was [this][1] list of Microsoft Products.

You could start by looking for [software on sale at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dsoftware&field-keywords=software&x=0&y=0). There are literally tens of thousands of products that meet your criteria.
