If you look at almost any product in the USA it says made in china in it.
The reason us multinational companies exist in china is because of the lower cost to manufactur there.

Chances are, if you find a great american product, that is made in america and you import it to china, that a chinese manufacturer will copy the product and sell it to the chinese market for a much lower price than you because of his lower costs to create the product and the lower cost in logisitics (seeing as he doesnt have to import it in)

Many US companies have moved there manufacturing to china.
The idea is to create their products cheaper and then sell them to the USA consumers for a higher profit.  The added bonus they precieve is to be able to sell to a huge population of chinese.  They quickly learn, as google did, that doing business in china is highly political, feudal, and there is little or no protection for property rights.

The only exception i can think of, where china does a lot of importing is Raw materials.  Raw materials such as aluminium and copper are in high demand in china and India. 

If you are not already doing business with china, there is no good reason to start.
The american consumer is still your best best, couple that with Canada, western europe and you have a winning strategy.

China has a long ways to go before it is legitimate trade parter for smaller businesses.

In my opinion the best types of goods to be importing from the U.S. into China are luxury goods or those of a high quality or good brand reputation.

It really depends on the scale you are talking about and you would have to do a lot of research into the specific niche you choose. The import market is very competitive and unless you have the right outlets and purchasing power you may find it difficult to compete on price.

One option is high quality machinery for use in industry. I have seen many factories etc importing their machinery from Europe or the U.S. because of higher quality levels than some those that are domestically produced. You have to really know your stuff though in this area and bear in mind that good for industry, machines etc may require after sales service provisions, such as maintenance.

Popular branded goods with a market in China will most likely have stablished supply chains or have manufacturing or sales outlets in China already.

Most importantly, if and when you find something you should ask yourself, "why hasn't someone already imported it?"
