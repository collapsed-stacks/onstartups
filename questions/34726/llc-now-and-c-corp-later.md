I am currently working on my startup myself without any income, but looking forward to release it soon in a month or so. By reading through all the Q&A, I was not able to find info on this scenario that I am having

- single owner
- no income with a very tight budget
- will start business soon and need legal protection
- will need angel fund or VC investment after getting traction (have decent user base)

So I am thinking to start a LLC (in my resident state - WA), and then convert to C-Corp later (could be at the time when starting to look for investment). 

Does that sound like an OK approach?

Yes, that sounds like a reasonable strategy. I don't see anything inherently wrong with that approach.

If you do end up trying to raise VC funds you'll need to convert to a C Corp, and likely registered in Delaware. But until then you can start as an LLC.
