<p>I just signed up with FastSpring as my payment processor, and am very happy with them.  It only took a day to convert from PayPal.  Fastspring also includes PayPal as a payment option, so I didn't loose PayPal as a payment option for my product.</p>

PayPal has no shortage of bad press online from sellers.  

However, as a buyer, PayPal really increases my *own* propensity to make small / impulse purchases.  Good buyer protection, no need to share credit card details, trusted brand, and the fact that my account is already sometimes funded.  

I personally think you'd have to offer it, but others may have more detail re effect on your conversion rates.
