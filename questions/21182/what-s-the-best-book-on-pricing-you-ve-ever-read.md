<p>Another good one is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0814415172" rel="nofollow">Pricing for Profit: How to Command Higher Prices for Your Products and Services</a>.</p>

<p>Also check out the free ebook Jesper linked to, Don't Just Roll The Dice. It's a really quick read, it has good information, and it's free. I think everyone should at least start with that one.</p>
