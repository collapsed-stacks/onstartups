I am new at website building, and doing business on internet. 

I have a simple question: 

If I set up a website for my business, and if I want company ads to appear on my newly built website ( a source of income for me), how do I go about contacting potential companies who might be interested in advertising on the webpage I set up?

<p>Have you looked at <a href="http://www.buysellads.com" rel="nofollow">www.buysellads.com</a> to start with?</p>

<p>Advertisers can pick your site to advertise on. This is a good starting point, as as your site gets more and more popular, companies will start contacting you to advertise on your site.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Guillaume</p>

<p>Start by joining an ad network.  A popular choice is <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/" rel="nofollow">Google AdSense</a>.  Their web site walks you through the process of formatting an ad unit and placing it on your page.</p>

<p>Their network includes thousands (millions?) of advertisers and they will automatically match advertisers to your site based on each page's content.  That said, AdSense does take a cut and their algorithms don't always target as well as a human.  So once your traffic grows large enough, it may be worth it for you to put more resources into ad sales.</p>
