Looking to bring on some developers and using sites like Vworker.com.  While looking for prices to offer I'd like to get an idea of what is a good price and a poor price for developers in different countries.  I was reviewing the CIA world factbook to get an idea of overal economic differences but its just to generic.  Any other easy to find data sources that people have used prior to pricing someone in another country?

You may see these two:-

https://www.odesk.com/contractors/software-development/

https://www.odesk.com/jobs/software-development/

And some other similar FreeLance websites e.g. FreeLancer.com,etc.

**You'll have to collect data by yourself, and if you are able to do some analysis, I would like it to be shared on this post so that other people could also benefit from your work.**

<p>Thinking about price per hour with regards to developers is mentality from the industrial revolution (or maybe earlier) and not appropriate for knowledge workers. It is though, still widely used. Because an excellent developer seems to be in the range of <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/73106/how-productive-is-an-excellent-developer-compared-to-an-average-one">10 to 100 times more efficient than an average one</a>, the price per hour is hardly relevant. Use instead VWorker.com to hire top rated coders for smaller project, which requires the skills and competences you need. They will offer a fixed price for doing the work and you can judge them on their price per project and not price per hour. If you like their work, hire them for new projects or formalize it in a way that you give them a basic wage per month and an additional wage per project to reduce their risk. </p>

@John Bogrand: ODesk provides the cheapest resources and the workers to be competitive at the same time.
