I've been working on a passion-project for a while called Pi Day Challenge - it's a site designed to inspire people about math and celebrate 3/14.

One thing that I thought about tonight was whether or not I should direct users to like the app/fan page ([http://facebook.com/pidaychallenge][1]) or the site itself ([http://pidaychallenge.com][2]).

What's the best practice in a case like this - app or site?

**Upsides I see to liking the app url:**

 - I already have 700+ likes on the app itself
 - We interact with fans on this page - it's like a pseudo Facebook page with a feed, etc.
 - If a user likes the app url, they become a fan of that page, and news shows up in their feed (I think)

**Upsides I see to liking the site url:**

 - When friends see their friends like it, the URL they click brings them directly to the site.  When they like the app url, it instead brings them to http://facebook.com/pidaychallenge and then they have to click "Go to App" to actually use it.
 - Could potentially give link love to the actual site - but I'm not sure

<p>If you're looking for link love, I think a +1 button on your site is the way to go. Facebook likes to your URL provide <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/google-facebook-likes-13153.html" rel="nofollow">No Link Juice</a>. If you're looking to build awareness I would go to the facebook page, if you are trying to move apps, maybe the URL is a better choice.</p>

I would say the site URL. It DOES appear on the news feed (I always get page updates in this way) and it makes it so people are  more aware of what's going on on the page and more active in it. If you run a search on applications in FB you can see that people are much more inclined to "like" a something, or comment on something in a page rather than on an application.

I'm with choosing the URL method.

That way it can help you gain publicity easier. If a person can view your site and (likes it), they will look for the mobile app as well.
