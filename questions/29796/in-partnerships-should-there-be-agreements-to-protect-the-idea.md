You are look for people to co-operate with you on a startup. That means you will share your idea with them, and I know sharing your ideas with people you don't know it's not the best thing.

So, my question is easy and simple, should anyone use an agreement before the idea is old? What things there should be in the paper?

The most important is the NDA (non-disclosure agreement). You might want to include a non-compete so they don't start a competing firm after seeing your idea.

You cannot move forward without sharing your idea but there are ways to protect yourself legally. However, if you are in a place where such legal protection is meaningless (China, etc.) then you must be much more careful.
