I am 22, I recently handed in my notice at my current full time work place, my notice period is almost up and I have been offered a 12 month contract to develop software for a company as a freelancer from my home.

This would be my first time working as a contractor and my question is in relation to the inland revenue and my p45.

As soon as I have signed the contract and start work I will need to cover my own costs and accounting / tax returns. I am unclear about how I go about handling my p45, do I need to ask for this from my current employer?

How should I go about informing the inland revenue that I will be contracting. I know that I can either setup a limited company (the most advised path) or use an umbrella company (probably going to be easiest for me). If I were to register with an umbrella company I believe my p45 will be involved / required. If I were to setup a limited company what would happen to my p45?

I have tried searching the internet but have not had much luck finding the information I am looking for, therefore I thought it might be best to consult others here, I am looking for the best advice (including references). 

Many Thanks,
Christian

You don't need to do anything with your P45 in either case. The P45 is a the formal description of your tax status for your new employer. If a limited company is your new employer, you just keep it. If you use an accountant, give it to them, otherwise, there's nothing specific you need to do with it. If the umbrella company is your new employer, if they are going to do your accounts too, they will need it.

In any case, you do need that P45 from your current employer.
