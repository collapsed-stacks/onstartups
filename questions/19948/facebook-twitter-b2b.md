What are your thoughts on Facebook and Twitter for primarily B2B businesses? It doesn't make much sense to me to have a facebook fan page if my services aren't really used by the general consumer.  

I guess twitter could be more useful if you're tweeting about your area of expertise. 

Do you B2B people use social networking?

If you want to engage your business through the people at the business and those people would be using twitter/facebook/etc then yes, you should have a twitter account.  But only if those people are interacting with your product on their computer already.

I.e. we sell software to other businesses.  Those people using that software are on their computer and tweet us, send us email, probably check their facebook, etc. 

But if you are selling steel manufacturing machines to other companies, don't waste your time.  

The people who sell laundry services to my building are on facebook and I don't believe their effort/time is being well spent.  We use the laundry service because our building owner chose it, and I guarantee you that he didn't choose it because they had a facebook fan page.  

However, it does work extremely well for them for customer service.  If you can provide customer service that way for your product, then go for it.

You Tube and Vimeo where we have 58 instructional videos have been our primary source of new business.  People all over the world search using words like screen printing to find us.  They look at postings by others, but when they see our videos the see much more helpful and credible information.  Then many contact us with questions and to receive free help.  All say there is no site like ours.  We are helping people mostly who want to have a business at home as their primary source of living or as a part time occupation.  Many are mothers raising families who work when the children do not occupy their time.  Their customers are local companies, clubs, schools, teams and events.  We teach how to set up and run a business profitably, and we do not charge for that service.  Many, but not all, buy their supplies from us at the same price a competitor would charge, but the competitors do not offer the business and technical support we offer.  We established a web site that is education only - no advertising or selling - www.ScreenPrintingBiz.com.  We have another site www.rjennings.com where people can look up prices of all the items they might possibly want.
