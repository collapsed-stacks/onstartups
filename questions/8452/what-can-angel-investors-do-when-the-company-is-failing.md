I'm an angel investor (B Round)of a new start up company. But unfortunately, the company seems to have failed. But the CEO never clearly says that the company has failed. So, what can I do. And most importantly, what would happen to my money and is there any way I can get some of my money back?

Unfortunately, you don't have many options. If the company has truly failed, then your money is most likely gone. It also depends on what type of investment you have. If you actually have stock or convertible notes. 

If you have stock, then you need to look through your agreement and figure out what your voting rights are. You can then talk with other investors and demand that the CEO give a full accounting of the condition of the company. You can also ask the board as well for that. If that does not work, then you will have to go the lawsuit route, which can be long and costly.

If you have convertible notes, then you really don't have much power at all since those have not converted to stock yet.

So, your best strategy is to candidly talk to the CEO about the conditions of the company and let them know that you will be talking with other investors about getting some answers.

Low risk, low return.  High risk, opportunity for high return. If your angel investment fails, you lose your investment. That's it.
