I own a domain which is my first and last name dot com and I was wondering if it is better to have [my first name]@[my domain] or me@[my domain]?

Which is more professional? Does having [my first name]@[my domain] seem repetitive or does me@[my domain] seem silly?

Some people seem to prefer hello@ instead of contact@ (I like that myself).
me@ sounds like you plan to stay a one man show forever.
i have seen people using initiales, like john Doe would use jd@doe.com

this looks good for australia:
[my first name]@[my domain]

But germans are pretty conservative on that: you usually dont speak to somebody with his first name if you dont know him.

You yould also do:
john.doe@doe.com

I think it really depends a lot on the image and culture of your business and also on your target customers. Which one do you think your customers would relate to more? That is your answer. If you think they don't care choose whatever you like.

And don't sweat the small stuff. Your startup will not succeed or fail based on your email address. Make a decision, get some feedback and change if necessary.
