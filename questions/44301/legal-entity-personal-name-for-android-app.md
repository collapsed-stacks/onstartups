I have built an android app and would like to put it on Google play. 
I found several articles suggesting it's safer to create a legal entity and put any applications under that entity rather than put them under your name as an individual from a legal perspective. 
 
Although I started this app for fun, I haven't found a similar app on Google play yet and I obviously don't want to find myself personally liable or my assets involved in any way in the odd case the app is not downloaded only by my friends. 
On the other hand, as I am not building apps for living, I wouldn't want to add all the costs of creating and maintaining a legal entity if the chances of getting into legal problems are next to nothing. 

Any one know for a fact it's best to do it one way or another?
If I do decide to start as an individual is it possible to change it later on to a separate legal entity?

Thanks

Well it depends on what type of app you are planning to release. If your app does not need a lot of permissions on the user's device in order to work, you are OK to release it as an individual. The number of permissions and their kind directly defines your app's activity on the device and so forms a liability. To overcome such liabilities, its better to be a legal entity rather than an individual. 

An app intended for fun should also be analyzed for liabilities prior to its release.

If you are sure that this app does not create any risk/liability to you, release it straight away.
