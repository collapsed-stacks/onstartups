I just learned about BizSpark and found it quite perfect for bringing my ideas to life as startups. 

I have 3-4 ideas, but I want to start with 1 at a time. Suppose I work on an idea for 1 year and either everything goes well or it fails. Can I then just start from scratch on my 2nd idea, and get another 3 years on BizSpark? Or do I work on all my ideas at once (but it will divert my focus, so I'd like to avoid it)?

<p>One <em>company</em> can work on multiple ideas, and that all at once, or in groups, or sequentially as the management thinks best.</p>

<p>A company can join BizSpark once. And then stay in the program for either 3 years or until a revenue of Â½ / 1 million dollars per year is reached.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that not <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/bizspark">all types of business / business ideas qualify for BizSpark</a>.</p>
