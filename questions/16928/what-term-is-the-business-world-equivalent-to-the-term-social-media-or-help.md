My business will provide an automated “tool” that can be used as part of the pre-sales/pre-purchase process.  A by-product of using this tool is the creation of a network of buyers and sellers.  (In other words, the user's objectives are not networking or socializing as it is with social media like Facebook; however, the end-result of using the tool is that they create and expand a network of homogeneous buyers and sellers that may result in a Facebook-like network of interconnections.)  We want a term that conveys the Facebook-like netowrking effect that dosn't also convey "socializing".  

Describing the tool as “social media” does not seem accurate, because it’s not about "socializing".  Then what is an appropriate term to describe the business equivalent of social media? The best terms that we have come up with are “B2B/B2C Enabler” and "B2B/B2C Network Enabler", yet that doesn’t seem to capture it and something like “business media” or “business networking” is too vague.  

So, is there already a business world equivalent for “social media” (so we don't have to explain it when we use it)? If not, maybe the term will be coined on (and credited to) this site, so what suggestions do you have?

<p>there are indeed different terms used to describe products that brings social network dynamics into a company (or a group of company). The two I see more used are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Enterprise 2.0 (very broad term to describe all enterprise software trying to leverage on the usual Web 2.0 concepts and technologies) see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_2.0" rel="nofollow">here the Wikipedia entry</a></p></li>
<li><p>Social business. I saw this used (for example <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/01/understanding-social-business.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), but it can be confused with "business with a social objective", so I wouldn't adopt it</p></li>
</ul>

Since vp inspired "B2Z", what do you entrepreneurs think about other variations of the "B2B" or "B2C" acronyms where "We" is used to express the aspect of groups interacting with businesses (interacting with groups) like "We2B"?  

Or waht about about “Me2B2We” or “C2We2B” to convey that it’s a consumer’s interest in business that spawns a community focused on a business segment?

Vote your ups or downs depending upon whether you think this is meaning and might stick or too corny/confusing.
