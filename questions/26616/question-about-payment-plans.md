I am working on a similar service like netflix but for foreign television. How much should I charge? $10.00/month? What would determine that for me? 

Also how do you think Netflix partners with broadcast companies such as Fox. Do they pay for licensing or do they share revenues? (Obviously, no one would know for sure, but I am asking for an opinion here)

Should I reach foreign broadcasters, see how much they are asking for licensing and upload costs and decide a fee from there? (To help see how long it would take to break even)

Note: Please forgive me if I asked a question that may seem obvious. Do not vote me down, just let me know and I will take the question off.

Thank you.

I'd say you need a good estimate of your costs and potential customer base before you can set a payment plan.  Television isn't cheap though, and you'd likely be starting small.
