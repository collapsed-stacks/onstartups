Let's say I hire some remote contractors. Some are based in the US, and some are international.

I want to pay the contractors on a bi-weekly basis.

What is the best service to use for paying my contractors?
My understanding is that paypal has a large fee when you pay more than $1K. What is the best alternative?

You don't payroll contractors, contractors are usually paid as contractors 1099.  The best way to pay them is by check, international ones by wire or paypal (paypal is cheaper than wire usually).  

Make sure that all your contractors have signed the right agreements and that you are reporting amounts paid to the irs.

As a Canadian contractor who has worked with many international companies, here are some notes on the financial side of things (not legal or automated)...

1. PayPal was almost always the best option.  Fees were expensive (doesn't the receiver pay the fees?) but usually better than the alternatives.  PayPal is actually quite reasonable... it's only expensive if companies are paying via credit card.

2. Other common services like Western Union, Moneybookers, etc. usually high send fees, often depending on location as well.  They are also a pain to go pick up, but payment is available same day.  

3. Checks were the cheapest way, but also the slowest.  You have to factor in transit time (sometimes up to a few weeks), or you can pay for express.  The other factor is how fast checks clear.  In some cases, I had to wait up to a 6 weeks for a check to clear.  This is very tough to take.

4. For countries with good connections (US-Canada, for example) try and find a bank-based solution.  The company I worked with for several months was in the states, and they could not pay non-US contractors with wire transfers (essentially payroll).  However, I found that my bank also has a US branch which I was able to set up, and now I can get paid directly to my US account, and then transfer to my Canadian account for free / instant.  The other HUGE benefit here is the exchange rate.  Even with PayPal, I now transfer to my US bank instead, and exchange it at the bank where the exchange rate is noticably higher.  (Note: this is NOT simply a USD currency account in Canada - it's an actual US-located account)

My bottom line: if you can avoid any middle-man services, you will save a lot of money!

You can ask your contractors to get a free paypal account that accepts credit cards. You can pay them their actual salary (using your card) and let them worry about the fees. An alternative way is to to hire them through odesk. It gives you more control and guarantees your work upto a certain limit. Again, Odesk will charge your contractors 10% percentage of their wages.

<p>We are dealing with contractors in countries with strict currency importation laws because of runaway inflation (cough, Argentina). </p>

<p>I recently learned about <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/atmcash-com-announces-way-pay-freelancers-worldwide-075710668.html" rel="nofollow">ATMCash</a> and it appears to be exactly what we needed.  For 10 bucks you send the freelancer an ATM card then load it up.  The limit is $2,500/mo and the best part is that they only charge <strong>$5 per transaction</strong> regardless of the amount.  They can withdrawal their funds from just about any ATM.  It appeals to me also because I think the plastic in their hands makes the relationship that much more tangible.</p>

You can use Ikobo, Moneybookers, Wire transfer (for larger amounts). You can't really get that much cheaper than paypal unless you have a local bank account in that country.
