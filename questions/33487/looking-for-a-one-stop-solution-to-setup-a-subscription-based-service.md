I am looking for a one-stop-solution to setup a subscription-based service:
[subscription page] + [payment] + [Delivery of username/password] + [access to tool based on username / password]

I do not know how such a service would be called... hence it is difficult to find it.

- does such service exist?
- how is such service called?
- any recommendation if service exists?

I think I see what you mean but please correct me if I'm wrong, you have a service that you want to charge a subscription fee to but you don't want to have to set up the subscription payment or access to the service through a secured login yourself but you would rather outsource that part to a third party service? 

Just out of curiosity, how much would you be willing to pay for such a service?
