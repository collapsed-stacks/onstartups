I am developing a web application, the whole idea is a social network. There is a list of features/characteristics/apps that the users will be able to use either free or charge or paid and a list of features I will include to the network for the communities.

This application will be dedicated to professionals, business men and business, so the features/apps do not have any relation with games or similar things, but features that will help their online presence and the whole application as a community/social tool for changing ideas and and and.

To summarize all that, besides the profile page and main standard features, there are several other things I will include to the community as a whole and to the users for theirself e.g. conversation forum dedicated to each profession, galleries...

My questions are, 

 1. is it better to launch all of my features at the beginning with
    the chance to have an "empty" looking site?
 2. is it better to launch all features and give time for friends and close people to fill it up?
 3. or should I introduce one new feature quite often preparing people for what is coming next?

Thank you for all your info.

What do your users want?

There is a common school of thought that says launch early and update often, but you have to have something that adds considerable value for your prospects on day one.

Hopefully, you have at least a few potential customers lined up that you can talk to, in order to establish what the "minimum viable product" is. What they'd consider to be the most important features, etc, to start using your product, and even paying for it.
