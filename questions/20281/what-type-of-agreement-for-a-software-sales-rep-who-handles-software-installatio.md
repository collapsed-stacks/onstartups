I need an agreement for this but not sure what type of agreement for this. 
I have an independent sales agent who want to market our software and provide installation and first level customer support. He wants to  invoice us for commission and present our license agreement to customers and we should collect from the customer. So is this an agent agreement not sure how to handle this..Advice?

<p>You want a VAR agreement: Value Added Reseller.</p>

I have a question related to this. I am a business solutions consultant. What agreement do I need? VAR, independent contractor agreement, sales rep agreement

I have identified both the client and the software vendor. I intend to have the client pay the vendor directly and the vendor will pay me a fee that reflects my markup on the software and for other services I provide. The software has monthly user fees that will be charged directly to the customer and for which I am not compensated.

If I were preparing this type of agreement for a client, I would recommend an independent contractor agreement, recognizing that at least three different types of services (sales, installation, support) - with their respective compensation schemes and other rights and obligations - must be specified.

Frankly I think that deal sucks. He should either be an employee/contractor, or a reseller/VAR. The deal he proposes sounds sort of messy.
