As a CEO of a startup, I would like to stay informed about potential competitors. One source of such information would be to read news about startups that have received funding from investors. I am, though, having trouble finding news sites for such news. Any ideas?

I have not found a place that can do this for worldwide markets. I normally go to http://www.crunchbase.com/funding-rounds?page=1 or http://www.svdaily.com/fundingnews.html . The latter is mostly silicon valley companies.
