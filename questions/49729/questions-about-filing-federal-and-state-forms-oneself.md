My apologies if this has been asked before (I looked) and please point me to the relevant question.  I put my S-Corp on hold for a while (3 months) starting in March.  From January to March I was using Paychex to do payroll and process the government forms (941, state forms, w-2 at end of year).  But I really found it expensive and felt it was overkill for a 1 man consulting firm.  I'm seriously thinking about going for it myself this time.  Can someone point me in the right direction for what forms need to be filled out and contact numbers for the feds and state of california?  I'll get the discussion started with some answers and questions

1.  Quarterly form 941 must be filled out.  Available online I believe
2.  I believe the feds informed me long ago that I must make payroll tax contributions monthly (due to my gross company income).  There is some sort of electronic filing system to use (reference?  phone # of person to speak with?)
3.  940 for year must be filled out for feds.
4.  Form EDD 11250 must be filled out for State of California quarterly.  Any other state forms?  How to know how much disability, unemployment, taxes to pay and how?  Is there a phone number/website to get started?
5.  W-2s must be generated at end of year.  How?

Any pointers, links, flames are most welcome!
Dave

<p>You are in California and an S Corp.  I am a California CPA who does some programming on the side.  I do payroll for a local independent pilot who wants to be paid no more frequently than quarterly.  I think the quarterly fees are about $75.  Maybe if you talk to your accountant, he or she can work a similar deal.</p>

<p>If not, let me know where you are in the state.  Maybe with faxes and scans we can make this easy for you.  You can contact me via my website at <a href="http://www.rodenhi.com" rel="nofollow">www.rodenhi.com</a>.</p>

<p>And, if you just want some pointers to keep you from falling off the edge of the world, contact me and I think I can help.</p>
