Is there any mixed source or book about how to use Agile Development with Customer Development Process? Or with Lean or Toyota strategy?
I'm really curious about it. Thanks

Eric Ries is well known for mixing Agile with Customer Development to create the Lean Startup process.  Here is a link to a slide presentation he created:  http://www.slideshare.net/startuplessonslearned/eric-ries-lean-startup-schematic-view-of-agile-development-and-customer-development  to the website for his upcoming book:  http://theleanstartup.com/  to his blog:  http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/  and to the book pre-order site where he practices lean startup by iterating on the screens potential purchases see:  http://lean.st/  When you mix Agile, Customer Development and Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Development http://steveblank.com/2010/11/15/creating-startup-success-customer-development-business-model-design/  you get a very powerful methodology.
