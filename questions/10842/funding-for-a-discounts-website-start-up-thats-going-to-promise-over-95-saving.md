I am in the process of launching a website that would offer advertising discounts of any nature at just 1/100th of the cost of news paper ads or for that matter any other form of ads. To add advantage I will also allow support with SMS or any other form of communication preferred.

While I am in the process of making this website which might be launched say in a month or so, I do need funding to make this concept work fast considering that there are many such websites already live. What are the chances of getting funded and how should I be starting out for this request.

Any advice will be a ocean of wealth for me.

Cheers,
Arvind

Impossible to say without more detail, but here's some tips:

1. If this is your first company, you need more than a story and a promise.  Get specific and get evidence.
1. Get 10 people who *have already signed up* -- that is, have said on paper they're ready to pay as soon as it's built and working.  This "social proof" is powerful.
1. Can you get an industry insider as an advisor?  That's more important social proof.
1. There are a zillion startups who say *exactly* what you just said.  That means people are interested in funding such things, however it also means that statement is not sufficient.  You'll need to be specific about how, and it will need to be different from other strategies.
