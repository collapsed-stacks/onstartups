I have a question regarding Godaddys User agreement. When reading section 5 and specificly section 6, it sounds as if anything you upload to their servers for them to host, they can use and keep for themselves anything they wish. My concern is that if someone has a new idea for a site, (twitter, craigslist, facebook), does this state that Godaddy can steal your ideas for themselves and create their own clone site using your ideas? I can not afford an attorney to ask, so anyone knowledgeable is appreciated. Here is a link to their User Agreement (#5, and #6) Thanks

"  The applicable provisions are not intended to and do not have the effect of transferring any ownership or licensed rights (including intellectual property rights) you may have in content posted to your hosted websites."

6
"The applicable provisions are not intended to and do not have the effect of transferring any ownership or licensed rights (including intellectual property rights) you may have in content posted to your hosted websites."

OK I"m not an attorney and use at your own risk and suggest seeing an attorney but the two sentances outlined in the agreement spell out that the ownership is not in relation to what a user creates but instead is discussing the content that Godaddy already created.  So I have a different read on it then what you did.  To me it looks like they are just saying that the content that Godaddy created is theirs and the lic is not transfering ownership to the user.  Looks like your safe to me and it just doesn't make sense that godaddy would make a play like that.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a lawyer, nor experienced in these sorts of deals..

But the language is pretty clear to me, in that, the postings or content that these statement refers are more geared towards the user generated, to me that means the discussion forums, Polls hosted by Go-Daddy (Not of the Forums on your website, even though the site is hosted on GoDaddy).

So for a practical usage, If you host a PHP BB on Go Daddy, the content your users create on that Forum, will be governed by your TOC, and not that of Go-Daddy, and hence will not be covered under this section 5 or 6 above.

If you have a Site on GoDaddy, then that content becomes your content and not godaddy's.. You are renting the space to have your files in there, They would not/should not have any legal rights to that content.

Reinforcing the first two answers:

Sections 5 and 6 pertain only to content on Go Daddy's *corporate* websites, not hosted sites.
