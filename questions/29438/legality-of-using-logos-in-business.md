What is the legality of using logos such as Batman or JLS on or in products?  
If I make a t-shirt Iron on Transfer, with the batman logo or some other logo on it, and sell it, is that legal?

You would need to contact the copyright holders, and arrange for a licensing agreement to use their intellectual property. Likely, it would be in the form of a royalty paid to the content owner. 

If you start selling unlicensed merchandise, you are risking not only civil actions, but criminal charges as well. You are essentially 'bootlegging' branded merchandise.

You may do so legally only if you have an appropriate license from the owner of the image.
