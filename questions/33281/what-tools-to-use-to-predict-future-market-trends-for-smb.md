 -  [Google Insights][1]
 -  data analysis that could be learned from blogs such as http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/

**Don't follow the market trends in your industry, make them!**

Your best bet is to be entrenched in your industry and market. You should be the one having the ideas, blogging the ideas, doing the presentations and conferences, writing the white papers and creating trends and innovating in your market place.
