Hello I own a business service support firm which overs accounting, administrative support, and project management services. Currently, we begin offering software training and solutions to companies remotely and onsite. We have tried placing ads on Linkedin, Facebook, Craigslist, and Twitter, but no results. We have only gotten responses from freelancing websites like guru, elance, and odesk. How can we get more traffic and our business exposed?

You need marketing. You need more than just putting ads out into the world... Advertising that way is a game of statistics... If you just put those out there, and one in 500,000 Craigslist users is interested in your service, and 1 in 10 of those is actually looking for it right now and going to contact ads they find, you have to wait for 5 million people to see your Craigslist ad, which is probably not on the first page for much longer than 2 minutes.

You need to actually target your customers in a way that has worked. So do some research... Figure out who your target customer is, and then I bet you will have more ideas than I could list here about where to find them.

Start by doing some analysis on your existing clients. What businesses are they in? Are they independent professionals like real estate agents/lawyers/accountants? What are you doing for them? Is what you do for one set of clients that they find the most valuable different to what you're doing for another client group? Even contact your top 3 or 4 clients to have a brief interview about what your service is doing swell, and where it could be better. Use this info to build two or three customer profiles and figure out where those clients are hiding and how you can insert your product into their life in a way that grand their attention.

Or wait and hope your numbers game plays out... Not sure how many people search for that kind of service, though. They're probably too busy trying to get through their emails and letters and and and....

Looking at your business model, freelancing websites such as Odesk are your best bet. Join as many freelancing websites as possible and offer your services with something extra that will make the employer hire you. Ask your clients to write feedback on your Google locals/page and spread the word. Good white hat SEO is necessary to rank good in keywords, especially if your service is online. Join forums related to business management, etc. Keep an eye on your competitors and industry leaders and see how they are doing their marketing.
