## Anyone with Retargeting Experience?

My company is relatively small so we don't spend a huge amount on marketing each month. We do SEM, PR, etc. I've had a couple colleagues really push the idea of using retargeter.com or other to hit visitors to our site with advertising on other sites. I have to say given the modest traffic we get my gut reaction is that it just doesn't make sense.

Anyone with experience? Are there traffic levels a site should be getting before you'll really see a return by using the service?

Love any thoughts.

Have you checked out AdRoll.com? We do retargeting, and you can get set up with a free two-week trial to see if you get the results you're after. We focus on SMBs and have a cross-platform approach so even with a small list of visitors to retarget, we can find them pretty much where ever they go online. We've seen this work really well with our advertisers, with click thru rates 50-300% higher than with other types of campaigns. 
Cheers,
Hannah
