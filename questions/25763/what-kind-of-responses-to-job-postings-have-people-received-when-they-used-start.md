Were the responses to the postings worthwhile?


I am a little apprehensive to use these types of job posting sites because I am afraid that I will get a million worthless responses that I will have to sift through.

Getting **no** responses is often the problem.  craigslist generates the most worthless responses for us (I think because people run bots that just scan for new postings and email resumés to them irrespective of content).  

It's a truism of hiring that *someone* has to sift through the resumés and if you are in "startup mode" and are unwilling to use recruiters then that someone is going to be you.  After the first couple of hundred you get pretty good at it.
