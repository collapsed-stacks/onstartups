May I suggest two things:

1) Rephunter.net or replocate.com attracts a lot of sales agents and SMB resellers...

or

2) Look for reseller partnerships you will have abetter chance of success unless you have the cash flow to hire sales reps...Also note if you haven't sold your product yourself first chances are a direct sales rep will not perform up to your standard...

www.startuply. com is a good source for hiring workers for your startup.  There is a certian type of personality that is attracted to a startup.  Some people look for more job security, less risk.  Most startups that I know about are high pressure, low income, and can barely afford to keep the lights on.  Startuply also has some well funded ventures, so well worth checking out.

Craigslist is still my favorite place to put a job posting.  A member here operates **Techhotbed.co**m Might want to check that out too, looks promising.

Elance.com is for outsourcing and has people from the US.  Some of those people may be interested.  It is largely for product work.

You could also look on linked in if you know the right way to search.
