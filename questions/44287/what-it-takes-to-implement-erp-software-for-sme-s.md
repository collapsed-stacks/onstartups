I have a project to implement ERP Software for SME. Though I am a software engineer myself and briefly understand things involved, however as I am new to ERP platform and is not sure of what it really takes to implement such a software, 

My Questions are :

1. As the client is a SME and need low cost IT solutions, what are my choices ?, I have thought of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 over SAP due to its low cost overall, but is there any other platform better and widely used and scalable in future ? I am not sure if any open source platforms would be a goood choice here as I want robust, easily scalable, better tech support, large features set ..etc, So what are my options ?

2. how much such a software cost(say Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012) approximately for a SME (any typical example shall help), what kind of hardware cost(for servers) and software cost(ERP software, SQL Server ..etc) is involved ? and How much shall I charge for my client for such a software ?

3. Say if I opt for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, would MS send their person who shall help me in implementation ?

4. What kind of maintenance amount(should it be annual basis / as and when needed) shall be charged for such ERP implementation.

Thanks in advance!

 1. you can use OpenERP for example or any other license free ERP (they do have some support fees if you need them)
 2. this is super difficult to answer, I doubt it can go for less than a $10K and ca go up to $100K depending how big company is and which modules you need. This is price with licenses and implementation fee
 3. I doubt they will. If you never implemented an ERP system you better find someone who did or you will be over your head in the mud. 
 4. start from $2K for up to 10 users and grow accordingly

Hope this helps.

There are a few of the Open source ERP providers, and a few of them have a SAAS option now. Check out weberp, openerp, openBravo, Compiere.

Implementing an ERP like SAP is a complex process, as well as any other ERP. Its about understanding the whole business process, and training the staff to use and understand the intricacies of it.
