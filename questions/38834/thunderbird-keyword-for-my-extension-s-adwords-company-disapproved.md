I've developed a Thunderbird extension which allows users to create and share notes for emails. I would like to advertise it and sell subscriptions to the sharing service. Unfortunately AdWords disapproves the 'thunderbird' keyword. The report they have sent me doesn't states clearly under which circumstances I could use the keyword. 

I'm wondering whether there are any precedents with other software plugins and Adwords? How can I solve this problem?

<p>Google has the final say in these matters. If you want to use AdWords you have to play by their rules. </p>

<p>You have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not use the keyword "thunderbird" in your ad copy.</li>
<li>Contact the trademark owner and request that they allow you use of their mark in your ads.</li>
</ol>

<p>From the <a href="http://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;topic=1346940&amp;guide=1308252&amp;page=guide.cs" rel="nofollow">Google AdWords help center</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an advertiser has been restricted from using a trademark and disagrees with the owner's assertion of exclusive rights or believes he has a right to use the mark, we encourage the advertiser to contact the trademark owner directly and request permission to use the trademark. If the trademark owner (or contact person listed on the trademark complaint) provides Google with an authorization, the advertiser will be able to use the trademark in his ad campaign. Please note that the trademark owner may change or rescind the authorization at any time. </p>

According to answer I received from Mozilla team every add-on should receive approvement for purpose of advertising in AdWords individually. Also content of ads should conform to Mozilla Trademark Policy. By example such sentences as “Add-on Name for Thunderbird” are allowed, but “Try Add-on Name – featured by Thunderbird” are not allowed.

After all I hope my add-on will be approved.
