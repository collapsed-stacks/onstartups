I'm sure not which type of professional i should reach out to in order to get the proper advice i seek. I want to know specifically how much it would cost to LLC a company and the continued costs on a yearly basis in my state for owning this company. Should I talk to a lawyer or an accountant?

If you want to pay, then any decent lawyer/accountant/bus driver will google it for you and charge whatever you're willing to pay for it. Or you can do it yourself. Its not complicated. All this information is readily available on the regulatory authorities' web sites, and on many internet incorporation services' sites. Just google.

I'd find an accountant who might be interested in your future business and will therefore probably be quite happy to answer your initial questions for free.  

While you can (and should) google the relevant statutory fees, a good accountant can also advise on the likely tax implications / costs involved in filing accounts / taxes (assuming you don't do it all yourself) / optimal timing for converting to LLC, / any restrictions on shares to get advantageous tax rates / etc.

The statutory fees are one of the smaller running costs.

(If major liabilities are involved, or you need to set up some unusual corporate structure, you might need to talk to a lawyer too.)

a) call a registered agent in your state about fees, although you won't need a registered agent if you live in that state, they will know all about filing a new entity there

b) call the secretary of state about fees

combine the information
