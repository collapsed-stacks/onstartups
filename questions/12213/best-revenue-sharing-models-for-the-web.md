Although not running a charity, I like the moral/ethics surrounding revenue sharing business models, as I am socially aware, and like the idea of sharing money meritocratically amongst those who helped generated said revenue.

Has anyone got any links to useful articles/ideas on good revenue sharing models that can be adapted or applied to web business (including mobile web)?

I feel like I am beating a drum, but this is another case of looking for an affiliate program.

In terms of articles I would search affiliate marketing.  Off the top of my head, I can think of some people who cover the topic: John Jantsch http://ducttapemarketing.com Joe Jaffe (Flip The Funnel, a book), Andrew Chen http://andrewchenblog.com Chris Brogan http://chrisbrogran.com/

Also, Dropbox has done an amazing job describing their referral system (which, I would technically consider an 'affiliate program')check out the presentation here http://www.slideshare.net/gueste94e4c/dropbox-startup-lessons-learned-3836587

Programs come in different shapes and sizes, just as your product or service.  Just make sure that you measure your customer acquisition cost --and make sure there is ample room for a profit!
