I am Sakthivel from india. I am willing to start a retail selling business on all solar products to general public in chennai. There are few facts for this decision.
 

 1. My state is in deficiency of electricity and cuts 2hrs of power in metro cities and up to 16 hrs in rural areas.
 2. The suppliers and retailers are very rare to find even in business markets.
 3. The awareness and demand for products are increasing.
 4. Central government providing 30% subsidy of domestic and commercial solar projects.
 5. Easy loan sanctions, concessions , tax benefits are a plus.
 6. Only 60 government approved vendors are available now , where the population is 6 Million in my city , (120 vendors) 35 Million in state.
    
And so many good point to motivate me into this. I am an electronics engineer and technically i am good. but i have less knowledge about business tactics. I have good investment to set up and i know very well that i cannot expect good returns for at least 2 years. I want suggestions and ideas on what things i should remember from start up.

Your strength is in the technical area so you should drive the technical side in the business. Since you didn't mention you are experienced in business strategy, raising capital, hiring, and operation, the best thing you can do is to source for such skills in another person(s), possibly a CEO. 

Also worth mentioning that solar energy industry is regulated in many countries, so the CEO should have a track record in solar energy business and preferably with relationships and local knowledge in place.
