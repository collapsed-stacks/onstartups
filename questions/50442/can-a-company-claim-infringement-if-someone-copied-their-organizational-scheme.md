For example, if an Amazon competitor had the *exact same* product categories, or if a Craigslist competitor had the *exact same* categories...I'm mostly talking about how you categorize what you're selling.

Is that "trademarkable"? Can you be accused of infringing by using someone else's scheme?

<p>The copyright protection concerns only "original" creations. <strong>A list of categories or products is not an original creation</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>As far as it is a "logical" classifying that follows some comment sense</strong>, it can't be trademarked and it can be reproduced.</p>

<p>(if it is really original classifying or if it derives completely from the common sense, than it can be considered as "original creation" and thus protected by copyright - but that is IMHO a very rare/unique case - certainly not the Amazon product categories listing)</p>
