I co-founded a start-up a year ago (currently in seed stage) and lately have been struggling with working with my co-founder. I'm burnt out from having to battle this person's behavior (poor work quality, missed deadlines, etc) day in and day out. We're losing traction in his inability to do work and come to mutual agreements and I've lost passion.

Because of the nature of the innovation incubator we're sponsored by, technically he is "employed" by the incubator and so asking him to leave is not feasible. However, the option has been presented that I could request to be split up from him. Doing so would allow me to pursue my own venture with the resources of the incubator and have him manage the venture without me.

I want to request a split up from the incubator's director, leaving my co-founder with the current prototype development team and concept. I wish to explore other opportunities and markets; no concerns with having the project continue without me and the prototype development team would be largely unaffected by my leaving. Business matters would be a bit challenged, but there are others who could choose to work with the co-founder on it.

What is the best option for me at this point? To stay and hope to work something out with the other co-founder or to leave? If I were to request a split, what is the best and most strategic way to exit--how do I present the situation to the incubator program and to the prototype development team? 

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated!

<p>Your situation is unclear: is it your company (you are the majority shareholder in a C Corp)? Then what does the employee relationship between your co-founder and the incubator matter? There are some legal agreements that you need to read again and tell us about.</p>

<p>You've heard of <a href="http://blog.fairsoftware.net/2009/02/11/reward-performance-with-vesting/" rel="nofollow">vesting</a>, right? I hope you put that in place when you started.</p>

<p>I don't understand why you wouldn't be able to retain control of your project. What kind of incubator takes ownership of the Intellectual Property developed during incubation? That's not really founder friendly.</p>

<p>Bottom line: splitting with a co-founder is painful, but can be handled gracefully. I'm guessing that the co-founder is aware of the tension.</p>

<p>You must first decide for yourself what you want: get back the control of the company? </p>

It sounds like you've already made your decision. 
Unless there is some proprietary product at play, move on.
