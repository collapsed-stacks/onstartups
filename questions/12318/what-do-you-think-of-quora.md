I just had a look at it Mike (as a consequence of you mentioning it here!) First impressions are that the information seems a bit unorganised and overwhelming. Also, I like it here that you can have people's photos linked to their comments as it makes it more personal. Quora doesn't seem to do that.

It will be interesting to see where they go with it. I think demand for this kind of knowledge sharing technology will only increase

I see some paragraph of text that this is questions and answers (about what?) and a requirement to log-in to find out more info. So, nothing at all.

Quora is awesome, the key differentiators between Quora and OnStartups are:

 1. Quora has numerous "rockstars" answering questions
 2. There is way too much spam here recently
 3. OnStartups has better game mechanics (points, badges)

I think both are useful, however, expect much more detailed answers on Quora (for better or worse)...

I've used Quora a lot and am a big fan & user. I would go so far as to say that the answers on Quora have solved a lot of my startup issues and helped me bring my startup up to launch. I've never had much of an issue with the interface. The reason they decided against putting a persons's picture next to the question they ask is to take the focus away from the person and instead focus it on the question. I don't know if this has been detrimental to the cause because I've found good quality answers for most of the questions. But I must say I like that the our picture's are shown here. I've recently started using answers.onstartups and I like both services. 

I think a more appropriate question would be what differentiates answers.onstartups from Quora really? Apart from this site catering only to startup questions - because if you take a look, there are a lot of startup questions/answers (its probably the core subject) on Quora as well.
