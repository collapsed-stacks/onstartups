<p>I'm wondering if anyone has tips setting up an inside sales room. We have about 7 to 10 people making phone calls all day in a pretty narrow, smaller room. We've done a lot of acoustic reduction with foam and old cubicle walls as desk separators, but we're considering adding carpet or maybe more acoustic foam to lower the decibel level.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on organizing the room/positioning employees/tips on how effective more acoustic reduction would even be on the noise volume.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for any advice you have.</p>

<p>In a small space there isn't much that can be done. Carpeting may help you a little but generally speaking the temporary foam based cubical walling have a much better noise cancelling effect.  </p>

<p>If your team are complaining about the noise, not hearing themselves think etc, have you thought about using noise cancelling headsets with in-line mic controls? This will cut out some of the noise your team members are up against and allow for fine-grain control so your clients get some benefit too.    </p>

<p>You may need some dual 3.5mm to rj11 converters if you opt for pc headsets, as I have done for when I have to spend 2-3> hours on the phone.</p>
