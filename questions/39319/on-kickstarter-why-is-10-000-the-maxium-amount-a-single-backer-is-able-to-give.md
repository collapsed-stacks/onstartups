On Kickstarter, backers are able to give $1 to $10,000 USD per project.

Why is $10,000 the maximum amount a single backer is able to give per project?

<p>Securities law. See the <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/08/jobs-act-passes-crowdfunding-bill-startups/" rel="nofollow">JOBS Act</a>.
Anyone who invests more than $10k towards a company counts as a shareholder towards the 500-shareholder limit for a private company. If the company exceeds that limit, they are treated as a public company when it comes to SEC filings. From this, you can infer that SEC filings are a pain, especially for small companies.</p>

<p>*Clarification: Kickstarter's original donation model was not subject to SEC requirements, but the JOBS Act makes the $10k-in-exchange-for-equity business model viable.</p>

<p>*Further update: Kickstarter's official position on offering equity: "Weâ€™re not gearing up for the equity wave if it comes. The real disruption is doing it without equity. The real disruption is when you break down the funding of a project into all these little bits." - gigaom.com/2012/05/22/kickstarter-founder-perry-chen-intervie.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the principle drivers behind the IPO filings of Facebook and Zynga was the 500-shareholder rule, a vestige of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, which said that any company with more than 500 shareholders has to open its financials to the SEC like a public company. But under the JOBS Act, anyone who gives $10,000 or less will not count toward this limit. The act also raises the shareholder limit from 500 to 1,000.</p>
