In an effort to avoid spending $999+ on a Mac, I am looking for a PC equivalent of iMovie. I spent a few hours on a friends Mac and found iMovie (2009) extremely easy to use with a really professional end result. Is there any PC program that compares or do I have to suck it up and become a Mac guy?

<p><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/enhance.asp" rel="nofollow">Camtasia Studio</a> is pretty much the go-to software for screencasting &amp; light editing on Windows. I don't know what iMovie is like, so I can't compare them directly. If you want finer control over the audio side than what Camtasia offers, then many people use the free <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Audacity</a> alongside Camtasia.</p>

<p>Another consideration could be Microsoft's new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/" rel="nofollow">Expression Studio</a>, their "multimedia" suite with the modern day version of Frontpage, an image editor, and a video editor &amp; encoder. (All also available as standalone apps.)</p>

<p>Expression looks especially interesting if you're eligible for Microsoft's <a href="http://www.47hats.com/2008/11/bizspark-vs-empower/" rel="nofollow">BizSpark</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/WEB/websitespark/Support.aspx" rel="nofollow">WebsiteSpark</a> programs; which can provide free of charge licenses under certain (quite generous) terms.</p>

<p>You don't say if this is for a one-time screencast or if video editing will be a recurring task for you. Camtasia can do more or less everything you'll need to do with video, except supply talent and good taste. If this is a one-time affair, then you might consider going with one of the well known screencasters such as <a href="http://procasts.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Procasts</a> (there are several others), for that professional result...</p>

Suck it up.

I have tried Video Editing on both Mac & PC - although there is some high end PC software available for editing I have not found anything suitable at mid-range (with, as you say, robust performance) on the PC (Windows or Linux).

Plenty of bundled software packages that come with video cameras - none of them seem to be worth spit. Some only work with custom formats. I've got a four year old underpowered Mac laptop which is a better, faster and more versatile video editing platform than my dual processor desktop.

Good start-up idea if you have the knowledge - a $99 video editing package with the same functionality as iMovie.

I think you can use the AVS Video Editor or the Video Editor for Mac
And if the video is on the dvd, you can use the following link for a good software.
