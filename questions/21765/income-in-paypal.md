Does income in my paypal account need to be declared for tax purposes, or does it just have to be declared for tax purposes if I transfer my paypal funds to a real bank account?

Yes, you have to declare it. PayPal is technically a "real bank account", albeit virtual with lots of bells n' whistles.

Income is income, the method of payment is irrelevant.  You should be declaring it if it's in a bank, in cash, or barter.
