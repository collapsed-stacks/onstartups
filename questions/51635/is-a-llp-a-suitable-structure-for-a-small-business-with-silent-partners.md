<p>I'm evaluating whether structuring my small cafe business as a company or a LLP would be better. I will be the manager of the business, running it on a day to day basis and I will have 1 or 2 silent partners / investors who will be investing in the startup cost but not involved in any management or operations. </p>

<p>I'm leaning towards registering as a LLP due to the lower cost, lower tax, simpler operations, and limited liability. I do have some concerns about some legal aspects of LLP that I'm not sure will be the best arrangements for silent partnerships:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each partner gets a vote - silent partners are not supposed to be involved in management decisions</li>
<li>Individual partners can commit the partnership to formal business agreements without the consent of the other partners.</li>
<li>I'm not sure how to determine equity - is there such a thing in an LLP since there's no stocks? What happens in the event of a partner resigning - how to determine buyout?</li>
</ol>

<p>BTW I'm from Singapore, here is a reference on legalities of LLPs in my local context:

<p>Would really appreciate some advice if a LLP or company would be the best way to go for my situation. Thanks!</p>
