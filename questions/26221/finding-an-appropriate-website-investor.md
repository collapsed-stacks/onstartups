If somebody has a website idea and make the website successfully (not on paper) and the local market is good (idea succeed) but he cannot extend the market because of management, finance and marketing issues (lack of experience, budget...) and the idea is going to expire after a while, how can find an investor for such a website.

My question is not just about financing, an investor with similar past experiences and reputation.

Finding the right investor is like finding a partner. It takes time, there are such dating websites and groups, typically angel investors are what you are looking for.

Build up a profile of the type of people you need (it may be more than one). List out the skills and attributes you lack, along with the personality traits that will suit you in a working relationship. Work out what you are going to offer them ... 50/50? probably not, but it needs to be thought out properly as to how much, what for and why.

STart talking, most major cities have events, over here in Melbourne we have FundingConnect, Tech23 and a host of MeetUp.com groups that you can go along to (though the Meetup groups are more miss than hit in my expereience).

Publish on your blog / website and twitter that you are "seeking a match with ..." and start the conversation off.

... If your idea is going to expire then I would say you need to build a "hungry" team first up, get people who are willing to work for the chance to make it big, and then get an investor who is ready to back you, bet big and help given the team is in place to nail it.

It really depends on the kind of opportunity: its size, scope and requirements.

For small needs, check with friends and family. 

For medium size requirements, ask your lawyer, CPA, doctor, etc. if they know of anyone interested in investing in startups. 

You can usually find groups of angel investors near to you by searching online--in the Valley, check out [Band of Angels], in Boston, [Boston Harbor Angels] among others--but if you choose to seek angel investment, be prepared to rigorously *prove* and *defend* your business and its model. 

And as far as experience goes, angels tend to be *very* knowledgeable in specific verticals, so choose carefully.

[Boston Harbor Angels]:http://angelsoft.net/angel-group/boston-harbor-angels

Of course, if you can, run away from OPM* as fast and as far as you can.
