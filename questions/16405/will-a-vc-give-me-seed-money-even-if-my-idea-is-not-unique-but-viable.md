I want to start a small local business. There is nothing unique or innovative about it, but there is enough demand in the market. I have no college education. Will VC still consider me?

I doubt VCs will consider "a small local business". That is not the kind of return they are looking for. The other things you mention are not as important as that issue.

VCs typically look at the chance of a high enough return.  Unique is not normally by itself a qualifier.  Infact if its unique most VCs will be skeptical of it unless you have something proving a viable market for this new thing.

Please provide more information.

1. What type of business do you have in mind?

2. How much seed money do you need?

3. What would be the size of your start-up in terms number of employees and geographical area covered?
