We are 2 partners of a shop. 

From next year we will no longer remain partners as I will be starting another business. My partner would continue to operate the shop.

What are the most common things that my partner would owe me as a compensation? How is it normally done?

Yes, it is a shop with goods.

Well, here it is - you get money from him. At least the value of the business per balance sheet (i.e. assets - liability). The rest is negotiation.

I assume referring you to your partner agreement would yield an underwhelming result.

It depends on how amicable, or otherwise it is, and whether there is a perceived (roughly) equal amount of time, money and effort that has been put into the business.
