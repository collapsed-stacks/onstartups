I currently use an Ooma VOIP converter box at my home office for phone service, and during preparation for a marketing campaign, noticed a previously-overlooked 'Terms of Service' clause prohibiting it's use for business.

For those who aren't familiar, Ooma is unlimited phone service without a recurring fee- buy the hardware, and you have a phone number forever.

Apparently, when Ooma advertises 'unlimited' phone service, it's actually marketing jive, since they consider anything over 5000 minutes to be commercial use.

I like(d) Ooma, because of the peace of mind that comes with not having to keep track of yet another monthly payment.

I'd like to know if anyone's familiar with a similar service offering commercially-legit phone service, without a recurring fee.

I've seen the hosted pbx services, and am not interested primarily because infrastructure is already in place to provide similar self-hosted pbx functionality.
If anything, such a solution would be a temporary fix until I found time to properly configure that, and would essentially be a move in the opposite direction of the low/no maintenance goal I have in mind.

I'm not at all a fan of SaaS, or anything that adds recurring fees- especially when the rented offering can be done in-house.
I think it's bad enough that I have to pay a registrar every 10 years for the domain name.

I'd be interested in hearing people's experience with implementing any type of service which historically would involve a recurring fee, without doing so.
Phone service especially.

Thanks in advance.
