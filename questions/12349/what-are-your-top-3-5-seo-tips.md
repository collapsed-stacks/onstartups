<p>NB: There is much more that can be said about this. I'll try to keep this post short, and on the things beginners can do and get a high Return-On-Investment from.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you don't know that much about SEO, then use a <strong>CMS with the page level best-practices already baked in.</strong> Don't spend time fiddling with the finer points of HTML, good CMS's will output fine and fully semantically valid HTML for you and save you a lot of time. Wordpress 2.9 with a few plugins, and the Wordpress 3.0 beta are good choices. Dharmesh Shah works on <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Hubspot.com</a>, which has a much richer SEO feature set. There are many many CMS's available that handle standard page-level SEO correctly; it shouldn't be hard to find one that fits your needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research your keywords.</strong> Use <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" rel="nofollow">Google Keyword Tool</a> or some of the paid offerings to research which keywords to optimize for. Don't blindly try to rank high for single-word keywords or two-word phrases that are highly competitive; at least not in the beginning. Within reason, optimize for your chosen keywords in your URLs, body text, and inbound links.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build links constantly.</strong> Continuously work on building inbound links (preferably ones that match the keywords you're targeting) from reputable sources. This is were much of the ongoing hard work lies.</p></li>
</ol>

 1. Learn as much as you can about SEO **before** you create your first page. SEO effects the design of each and every web page.

 2. **Validate** the HTML and CSS code on each and every page. If it doesn't validate there is something wrong with your code an that means the page will not display the same way in different browsers. It also means search engines may not be able to parse the page.
y you get caughy
 3. Google now takes **page load time** into account for search rankings. The more junk you put on the page, the slower it loads, and the lower your ranking *(compared to the same page with a faster load time)*.

 4. There are plenty of **online tools** that will help you optimize your web pages for search. Use them, but don't follow them blindly.

 5. Write the text on your web pages for your customers, not the search engines.

 6. Don't use any **"black hat"** SEO techniques. The best they can do is temporarily boost your position a bit. Eventually you get caught. The worst they can do is get you removed from a search engine. It doesn't seem worth the risk.

Tip #1 - Get lots of inbound links to your site.  Be sure they're "dofollow" links.  Links from pageranked pages are always best.  IMO, one of the best sources for inbound links are guest posting on others' blogs.

Tip #2 - Target a specific keywork or phrase.  Use the keyword in your domain name, title tag, header (h1) tag, and several times through the text content.  Also include the keyword in the footer.  When you create anchor text (blue links) into your page - use the keyword as your anchor text.

Tip #3 - Taxt is king in the world of SEO.  Flash content, videos, and graphics are fun bells and whistles, but they don't win you great points in terms of SEO.  Make sure each page in your site has lots of good old fashioned text.  Google's spiders categorizes your site's content and ranks its usefulness based on the words it sees - so give google 500 or more words of original content on each page.

1. Natural Content(Customer's Stand point).
2. Good Site Architecture
3. Quality Links

I will personally suggest not to follow any ranking factors as these days search engines are changing their algorithm quire often, So better not to follow any ranking factor and build your website exclusively for customers.

"CONTENT IS KING"

Use long tail keywords Targeting long tail keywords will gradually lead to more search engine traffic because youâ€™ll have a lot of pages indexed and ranking for specific phrases related to your website/business.

The 3 items below are very, very basic but so far it has worked pretty well for my blog:

 1. Use descriptive words in Title tags using the H tags.
 2. Content, content, lots of it.
 3. Get your links to your site in well-known sites, a way of doing this is by leaving comments in blogs using your name and a URL to your site - Google likes to see links to your site in other sites.

<p>SEO is basically done so that your page ranks higher in Google search results. Let me tell you a secret - about 75% weightage is given to how many page link to your site (inbound) and only 25% is on what your site contains.</p>

<p>Inbound links:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have an embeddable code / blog widget, etc, ask your friends to put it up in their blog.</p>
  
  <p>Lets say your product deals with recruitment, when someone links to your product ask them to link something like this - "My friend runs a <a href="http://yourwebsitename.com" rel="nofollow">recruitment</a> company and it's..." This helps Google understand that your website has got to do something on recruitment space</p>
  
  <p>If an inbound link comes from a site that has higher credibility, your rank is going to increase. Use sites like linkedin where it asks for your <em>Personal Blog</em> / <em>Personal Website</em>, etc. Change the text to suit what your product is into and provide a hyperlink to your website. For eg: My company focuses on Recruitment Tests and you can see the change I made here -> <a href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/vivekravisankar" rel="nofollow">http://in.linkedin.com/in/vivekravisankar</a> . Google values it higher since it's an inbound link that comes from Linkedin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the website</p>

<p>Well, you can do a number of things, but again try to be natural.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Title of the page is key. Use <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" rel="nofollow">KeyWord External Tool</a> to determine the competition of a keyword and appropriately put it up. The <em>h1</em> tag in your page should match with the title and also be relevant to the content. </p>
  
  <p>Content is king, get more things done on your site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My primary reason is to talk about the value of Inbound links. Hope you found it useful</p>

Lots of good tips here, but one that hasn't been mentioned is blogging. Having a blog on your company site and writing at least one 300 word post each week is a good practice in addition to these tips. If you're using Wordpress, you've probably already got a blog, but I just wanted to chime in with that tip, in case folks didn't have one.

Building backlinks is important, but good on-page SEO is extremely important as well. Also, don't use automated programs to do the SEO for you. Nothing can replace a human when it comes to SEO. Tools are just that. Tools. They are good for research, they are not good when it comes to doing the actual SEO.
