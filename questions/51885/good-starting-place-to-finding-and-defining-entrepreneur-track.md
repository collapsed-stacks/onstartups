<p>To narrow the scope of your question, I'm going to presume you are a technical, left-brained guy and you want a path to being a business oriented entrepreneur.</p>

<p>I'd say the two major skills are generating ideas and selling things/ideas.</p>

<p>As a techie, we mainly work in the deductive mode where we are applying known rules to solve a problem.  Almost all startups are problems of induction: given an existing set of facts, what new rule can I generate to solve a need or want?  One way to start to develop your inductive side is to become aware of things that are missing in your life, and in the lives of people you come into contact with.  Anything missing might be a business.  You can also practice generating ideas in general.  Check out the "daily practice" posts in the blog of James Altucher, or in his books.  He suggests writing down 100 ideas a day, every day.  One day write down twenty ideas for a friend's business, and then send them to him, for example.  It's like a muscle, and it gets stronger with use.  Of course, keep a file of the most interesting business ideas you have.</p>

<p>Now about selling.  You will have to persuade a lot of people of a lot of things to be an entrepreneur.  Might as well start practicing now.  Take some of your ideas above and flesh out a business model canvas/lean canvas.  Fill in the gaps.  Show it to someone, maybe a potential customer, maybe a friend.  They point out all the holes.  Iterate.  You are practicing your pitch.  Other places to practice pitching:  pitch competitions, Startup Weekends, hackathons.  If you can't concisely explain the value of what you are doing, you are dead in the water.  When a really good idea comes along, you won't blow it by having a limp pitch when it counts.  Until you have had a potential customer's face light up with "I want that!", you haven't got the right pitch.  You might finally realize you are better at the techie side, but from practicing pitching yourself, you are miles ahead in evaluating the pitching and persuading skills of a prospective partner.</p>
