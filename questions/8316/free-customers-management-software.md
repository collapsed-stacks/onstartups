<p>Microsoft Customer Resource Management (CRM) software is available free through their BizSpark program, along with nearly all Microsoft products. It's pretty easy to see if you qualify as a start-up. </p>

You could try Tactile CRM (http://www.tactilecrm.com/), which is web-based and has a free package allowing for up to 250 contacts and 20 opportunities. I use it at the moment and like it. Â£6/$9 per month gets you unlimited contacts and unlimited opportunities plus it integrates with other third party apps.

Another example is Oprius (http://www.oprius.com/) but I don't have any personal knowledge although I've heard it is good. BatchBook (http://www.batchblue.com/) is another that gets good reviews from users and I had a quick look around it but preferred Tactile.

Hope that helps,

Tom

<p>You can try <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/" rel="nofollow">SugarCRM</a>. You can install it on you own server if you want since it is opensource.</p>
