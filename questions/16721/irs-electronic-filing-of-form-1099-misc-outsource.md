## IRS Electronic Filing of Form 1099-MISC - Outsource?

My small business has reached the limit of 250+ vendors to receive 1099's and will need to file electronically through the IRS FIRE system this year. Can anyone else advise on a good outsource firm or specific software package to handle the submission? 

From what I can tell, the file formatting required could be more trouble for me to figure out than its worth and I don't mind paying a little bit to make sure its done properly, if its necessary. On the other hand I'm fairly tech savvy and wonder if I should just figure it out myself to save a few bucks. 

Any thoughts or experience would be greatly appreciated!

My wife owns a tax preparation firm and she uses ATX software to file regular and information returns electronically. Below is ATX's website address in case you are interested:
