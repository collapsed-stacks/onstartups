<p><strong>Question:</strong> </p>

<p>In the state of Pennsylvania, can a small unregister private C Corporation pay a different stock dividend per share amount to shareholders who hold the same class of stock? </p>

<p>I don't know if there are some specific rules in Pennsylvania (I think not) but in general:</p>

<p><strong>The shareholders with the same type of share must be treated in the same way.</strong></p>

<p>You would probably receive easier an exact answer for such a specific question on some forum specialized for accountants or on the tax administration website of Pennsylvania...</p>
