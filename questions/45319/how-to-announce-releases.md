I'm launching an app soon. I set up a "coming soon" page to get some buzz and to collect emails from interested user. The app is for iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8. The iOS release comes first and the other weeks after. Should I just announce the iOS release on the website or all?

Putting it on the site won't hurt but it might not help to much as well. I would suggest Tweeting about it. I've found out that if you toss out tweets and also follow people that they will see what your posting about. You'll also gain new followers. Remember, it's not the amount of followers but the quality.
