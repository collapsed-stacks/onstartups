I am hoping to generate some revenue by sending out emails to interested people about giving a gift to the company.  I am aware in order to say "donation" you must be a 501(c)(3) however if you claim it as a gift you are ok.  I am an LLC.  I am wanting to ask that if I change the paypal button to "gift" instead of donate and write in the email you cannot make this a tax deduction would I have to report this as income to the IRS and pay taxes? I have heard once that only the giver of the gift must pay taxes if above a certain amount and my gifts would only come in small amounts so technically would this be income I have to report? Thank You.

You can get legal issues with that. People are giving gifts to your LLC - why? What business purpose would it serve? It will probably be re-characterized as gifts to you personally.

Also, keep in mind that people might claim ownership after giving a gift to you. You have to talk to a lawyer to make sure you make the right disclaimers in the correct format to avoid many pitfalls.

And why on earth would people give you gifts to begin with? Do they know you? It might be that the IRS will claim that you're disguising income as gift (which is not that far from the truth, as it sounds) and disallow that.

Get a legal and tax advice from a professional (A lawyer and a CPA/EA).
