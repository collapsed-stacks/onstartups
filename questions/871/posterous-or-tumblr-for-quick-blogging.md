I use Wordpress for my primary blog. But I often want to write a few quick thoughts down that don't belong on my main blog.  I want something that's easy to contribute, easy to edit.  Any views?

I really like the interface of Tumblr. I do resize uploaded photos myself before I post them there, though, I like a consistent image size. 

I set up a Posterous blog for a committee I'm working on. It was easy to set up and password protect, and I can attach .pdfs to an email and send it in to be posted within a scribd viewer. 

If I was just going to be writing and linking and such, I'd go with Tumblr.

Mark, I use posterous for quick posts. Try it and within minutes you'll have an account, your first post will be up, and (if you hook it up to twitter) you'll start getting both traffic and comments quickly.

I love Tumblr, but for quick posts, posterous is dead simple and very fast.

<p>I've tried both. Posterous seems to only work when you e-mail content. Sending foto's didn't work properly, so I changed to Tumblr: <a href="http://tvandervalk.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://tvandervalk.tumblr.com/</a></p>

I use Posterous because I like the auto-post feature. Tumblr has more features and is more "pretty" but I think Posterous is easier and simpler.

It's not exactly a blog but I think friendfeed would be much better. Plus It has got a great social aspect and supports other micro blogging and normal blogging tools, websites.

I went with Posterous because of it's ability to post to Twitter, Delicious, FaceBook, (etc) as needed.  The robustness of the process via email leaves a lot to be desired -- I usually have to go back and hand edit the pieces for cleaner HTML -- but that's just me.

Why have 2 blogs? It is confusing for your followers.

Mark, 
I've been using both Tumblr and Posterous over the last 6 months and over time have found myself leaning strongly towards Posterous. I believe Posterous to be a better choice for the following reasons:

 1. Excellent Bookmarklet that makes re-posting (with edits) very easy.
 2. Email posting - a simple email to Posterous and you will have a post ready to go. Great for the mobile blogger.
 3. Better SEO performance - I have been able to do a lot better with Google on the Posterous blog.
 4. Multiple authors - its easy to setup and manage multiple authors and also host multiple blogs with one account.
 5. A simple and effective editor with ability to edit the HTML when needed.
 6. The Page Visit counter (you can also plug in your Google Analytics for detailed tracking)
 7. Autopost to more than 20 other social and blog platforms
