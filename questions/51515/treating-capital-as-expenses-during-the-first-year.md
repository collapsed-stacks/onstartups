<p>I believe that during the first year of operations a new LLC can treat all capital (up to $50,000) as expenses instead of having to amortize over 180 months.  I have 3 questions related to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this correct?</li>
<li>If correct, in starting 07/23/2013 am I limited to capital items purchased and paid for (cash method accounting) by 12/31/2013 (tax year end) or does the "first year of operations" allow purchases up to 07/22/2014 to be expensed?  If so then this would cover the 2013 and 2014 tax filings.</li>
<li>Is a computer tablet costing around $500-600 considered capital?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm guessing, since it hasn't occurred to you to mention, that you're from the US. The answer depends on the jurisdiction, and I think on this forums only the USans assume their country is the only one in the world.</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Capital is never expense. Expense is expense.</p>

<p>You're confusing different things. <em>Start-up expenses</em> (i.e.: expenses <em>prior</em> to incorporation, generally speaking, not after it already happened) can be deducted for tax purposes up to a certain limit, after which they should be capitalized for 180 months. <a href="http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/small-business-cents/startup-cost-tax-deductions-%E2%80%93-how-write-expense" rel="nofollow">Here's an explanation from sba.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Talk to your tax adviser.</p>
