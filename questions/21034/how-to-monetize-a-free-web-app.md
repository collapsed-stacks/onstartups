## How to monetize a free web app?

I need some help on the monetizing model for my free web app. 

It's a garage sale site and I thought of monetizing it by means of sponsorships [at the footer of the app] and a splash screen banner ad for 7 seconds after a user selected a city.

Would these models make a good return? Or is it better to charge people for listing their garage sales?

I'm really new in this field and I would really appreciate to get some advice from the experts.

You'll have to find the balance between displaying the Ad content and interfering with the user experience.

Would you be happy to go out touting for one or more Sponsors yourselves?  or would you be better simply using one of the existing Ad Networks like Google Adsense out there?

Personally I'd recommend the latter as it takes much of the effort away from you.  If parts of your site are hidden behind a login, it's possible to provide Google with some credentials so it can scan your site and assess it in order to display relevant ads.

However all of this is dependant on you driving a significant volume of traffic through your site.  20 visitors isn't going to generate much of a return if only one in 200 visitors actually clicks on an advert.  The more relevant the ad, the more likely a user is to click it, and the more users you have seeing an "impression" of the Ad, the more clicks you could get and therefore more revenue.

Just be aware that Google has some limitations on how many adverts can be displayed on a page which (in my estimation) make it reasonable without being too intrusive to the purpose of the site.

Just my Ha'pennies worth!

As Jason mentioned you need a lot of visitors to earn money on ads. I created a site once with translation crosswords, I had a few hundred visitors per day for about a year. In total I believe I earned 15$ during the whole period. I spent a lot of time on it, trying different things like Google Adsence Amazon Books relevant for learning a language etc.

I believe that if you want to make money on the web from advertising you need to make a site, which will bring thousands of visitors and where they will spend a lot of time. If you are not creating such a site (as I believe is the case for yoU), then you should instead monetize in a different way. Charging the customers seems like a possibility, but you probably need some visitors before you can charge anyone, so I would make it free in the beginning.
