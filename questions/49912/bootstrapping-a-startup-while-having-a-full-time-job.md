I have a full-time job, 40 hours a week. I make good money that helps me have a secure life and leaves me some money for savings + about $200 to fund for my project. Basically I can do both the programming, UI and Graphic design. Also I can do the general admin tasks such as setting up environment, backing up data and etc.

I was wondering if I can launch this project as a side project and maintain it alone without having a co-founder. I am fully capable of implementing the whole thing end to end, the only problem is, one person can only work on one thing at a time. Anyone has done this, starting a start-up while working a full-time job ?

<p>Working full time and starting a new business can be done. I did it with my current brick &amp; mortar business. While it's not easy, I think this is the true test of an entrepreneur - how much are you willing to work for it? My first venture was the typical drop-out-of-college pipe dream...and it didn't last long. Going all or nothing by quitting your job is a dangerous game plan when most start-ups fail within the first 3 years. Instead, work your butt off in your spare time and build a product/service that generates revenue to the point it <em>forces</em> you to leave your day job. No one says it's going to be easy, but if you're looking for an easy buck, starting and building a business is not the path to take.</p>

<p>A great reference for a place to start is a book by Dan Miller that I've read called <a href="http://www.48days.com/">48 Days To the Work You Love</a>. I like his recommendation to use your most creative hours (first thing in the morning before you put in 8-10 hours working for someone else and come home mentally drained) working for yourself. Bringing in a co-founder will complicate things for you. You'll have to decide if the costs (time, energy, ownership) outweigh the benefits. Best of luck!</p>

**Since i am software developer**, i know how much you have to concentrate on a problem and how draining it can be.
I may be one of those guys you are talking about. The only difference is i am the founder of just a small website.

To be frank if you are still intending to work and manage a company on your own- **It would not be impossible but would be really difficult**.
I have good designing skills. I am a developer working full time in a reputed software company and also manages a team of 7 dot net developers in the company.
 
Still, my site is growing day by day only because of a partner and a close friend who is also in the same situation like me. 

From what i can get about what you have written is, i am talking to a clone of mine. May be a bit more talented clone :) 

Don't be afraid of having partners unless you don't trust them. 
**An extra hand would always help.**

Weighing in #3 - I started a company with a co-founder a year ago.  We were both working FT.  The company was going to require quite a bit of labor intensity, so depending upon what the business is this may/may not be possible.  There are a lot of things to consider that aren't readily apparent so expect to spend more time than you imagine.  That said, we started both working, added a 3rd partner then I quit my job after 6 months when we knew we had a good infrastructure.  My biggest concern for you is $200...
