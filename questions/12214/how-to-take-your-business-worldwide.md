I have a small scale industry in India. We are manufacturing construction-related steel items. I want to expand my business to other countries, but I'm not able to fetch good potential customers. Can you guide me? How can I start? For exporting, what tools can help me?

Try that: do not do it. Seriously. Starts with your english and spelling (as in: GET THAT FIXED FIRST - no, no joke, but when negotiating you want to be SURE that what you say is what you mean).

Mein problem is: if you are small scale, you are not competitive. You have neither a clue how construction regulations are in other countries, nor the means to get them etc. You have a significant disadvantage - regardless how bad you pay your workers (low wage), shipping for high weight items (i.e. steel) is non-trivial, so you run against other producers that are closer, are larger, have the infrastructure in place. Shipping costs may be a big negative for you. Especially if you have no special / rare items that can justify coming to you (and in that case most likely you would not ask the question to start with, as people from other countries would have contacted you).

Your best option is:

* Expand locally. India is a hugh place, and - sort of - a lot of building is going on there.

I would suggest the following approach:

Move your business to integrate as a supplier to a large multinational company that has a local presence.  To achieve this review their supplier requirements and make sure that your manufacturing processes match what is required.    Learning from a global partner is the best way to integrate into the global market.  They have best in class manufacturing requirements and getting that kind of reputation I would think would give you chances to connect into the global market.  

Not sure the size of your company but sounds that your still a small outfit.  When you look at your manufacturing processes and compare them to where do you fit?  Is the equipment rather new, do you have a diverse group of engineers and metallurgy experts that have experience from a big outfit?  Are your sales staff competent with other cultures are well verse in English from a Western style or well verse with Chinese?   Do you have logistics capabilities or do your buyers do all the logistics?   
I’m not in your industry at all so I’m just throwing questions I would be asking.    I’d start with looking at what is going on local and who is connected with the global players.  If you can become an integrated supplier with a larger outfit maybe you can get the learnings that your firm needs in order to become a global seller of steel.
Luck

First thing first when its a small scale industry in India why do you want to expand other countries when you can increase your market here?

First question is why do you want to expand it to other countries when its still small scale industry in India

What will you show to your vendors or business partners in other countries when they ask about your business in India?

They might be having many many options in India who are your competitors or bigger than you?

First expand your business and create a brand name and brand value for your product in india and then start expanding your services to other countries.

Go to meetings and seminars in your sector meet lot of people there and try to maintain relationship and it should be a positive relationship and study whats happening and try to analyse and then take step forward.

Try to attend international meetings and seminars on your business where you have wider reach and where you might be knowing lot of guys from other countries and from there you can collaborate with some other companies and then you can expand your business.

My 2cents suggestion is first create a brand value of your company and opportunities come automatically
