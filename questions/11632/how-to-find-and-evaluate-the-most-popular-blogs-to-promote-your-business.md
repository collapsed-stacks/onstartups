I would like to find bloggers who speak to my target market, and who might mention my business and therefore drive name recognition and search engine optimization for my website.  Any suggestions on how to go about identifying the most popular bloggers in any given market niche, and how to find any actual data regarding their level of popularity?

Technorati has some data, but you might consider that the bigger they are the less likely they are to respond to a cold email asking for promotion.

You can also use compete.com to get traffic results. It doesn't show data for sites with a small amount of traffic, but you are probably not looking for them anyway!

Try alltop.com and research lawyers or law and look over the blogs and see if they write information related to what you need. You can use alexa.com to check out their ranking and if they are large enough or have been around long enough alexa will tell you if the blogs popularity is going up or down, the readers demographics, what words the readers used to find the blog, inbound links the blogs and much more data. You can use google reader to keep up with the blogs that you find interesting. 

Bloggers may not just mention your business for no reason so I would read the blogs and the posts and post comments and answer questions on the blogs of interest to you. I would not post promotional content, bloggers do not like that. I would find a few blogs that reach my target audience and become active in commenting on the blogs. You can also offer to write guest posts for the blogs that you are following.

Good luck,
Jenn

I can't answer your question, but I would suggest you also try posting your question on inbound.org. It's a site like this one, but its focus is inbound marketing. The site is still really new, so there aren't a lot of users yet, but it's worth a shot.
