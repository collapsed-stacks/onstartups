<p>Upon reading/hearing this line: <strong>"Your Group Content in One Place, Organized"</strong> would it strike a cord of interest?</p>

<p>We are currently in the works of developing a platform to effectively capture and share information/knowledge for individual and group level. This is the current messaging we have, and are in the process of getting the right messaging out there that would surround the core benefit of the product.</p>

<p>We would love to get answers from startup gurus out there, 
if we have the right messaging? 
How would you say it in a much better way? </p>

<p>We appreciate all honest answers and discussions so we can better connect our messaging with the core benefits of the product. Thanks everyone! Cheers!</p>

<p>As someone who is actively looking for proper workflow/team management, I can say that that particular line is not particularly interesting. All it makes me do is think of Dropbox...and I have that already.</p>

<p>No, doesn't interest me at all. It's too generic and bland (and obvious). </p>

<p>The world "Group" is too generic, and the word "Organized" is obvious. Would it possibly be unorganized?</p>

<p>Having all my content in one place doesn't tell me at all why I NEED to use your product. I could have all my content "in one place" in a network file share dumping ground...</p>

<p>People are attracted by something they know are popular, or by something that they never know .... Your message is too 'normal' and meaningless , I suggest better analysis of your public and see the niche which you are working in ... at least try to bring something new to that people , so they can stop and maybe, look at your product.</p>

<p>As EkoostikMartin confirms my opinion, your message it's too 'common'.</p>

<p>As DaveyBoy says, you do not attract people from his niche.</p>
