What are the services that must be included in a school management software?

How should one market it

What is your take on the idea?

If you don't have domain knowledge or a partner with that knowledge I'd suggest staying out of it.

(the following assumes public school.  Some points are specific to public schools, not private ones)

The challenges:

- Unless you are targeting a small niche of functionality, you will have to go through a bidding process - FOR EACH customer
- Most of your target audience already has software and you have to displace that existing provider.  If they are not already using software you will have to convince them they need it.  That is expensive.
- There is a lot to "school management software" - tricky things like scheduling algorithms, privacy policy compliance, etc


If you are asking on a forum like this, I'd guess you should sit this one out.

If you already have the software and infrastructure based on another vertical market, then you can probably leverage that expertise.  If you are just starting out, it is going to be an uphill battle.

If you are up for the challenge, good luck.  Let us know how it goes.

<p>These guys are going at it with a Software-As-A-Service business model.</p>

<p>You would need to have a prototype and visit lots of schools (in the beginning).</p>

<p><a href="http://schooltool.org/" rel="nofollow">School Tool</a> is an Open Source School Management System. </p>

<p>The vast majority of schools in the UK use <a href="http://www.capitaes.co.uk/SIMS/sims.asp" rel="nofollow">SIMS.net</a> (School Information Management System) from Capita.</p>

<p>BECTA (which used to be called the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) holds online functional specifications for what (they say) School Management Systems should be able to do, <a href="http://industry.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?page=1819" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>
