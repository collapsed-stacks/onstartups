<p>I am now running an IT company in Australia and providing Software Development &amp; Web Development Services in Australia. I have a team and enough project however I don't want to bound only within Australia. How can I trade in other countries without physically presence. What are the best ways to market in United States in order to attract projects from United States? Can anyone suggest free marketing techniques such as SEO to trade globally?</p>
