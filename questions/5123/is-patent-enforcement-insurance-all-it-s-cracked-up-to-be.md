## Is patent enforcement insurance all it's cracked up to be?

There are a few companies out there that seem to offer insurance packages for small(er) players in a market that want to be able to defend patents that are likely to be infringed. 

On the face of it, this makes good sense (given reasonable premiums and terms), but there seem to be very few providers of this kind of insurance product, and very few stories online that tell of successes/failures which would give a prospective buyer more insight.

Has anyone here had experience dealing with some of the providers in this market? Has anyone used this before, and if so was it money well spent?

I didn't work directly on it so can't quote prices and experience but I would suggest to ask yourself some more questions on what it is that your defending against.  

A startup that I was an employee that was a JV from some larger firms where working in space where there was a lot of patent possible fighting as the companies tried to position themselves for the 3d movie technologies in theatres.  For them it made sense because of the financial backing, the protection the investors required and to get rating from the rating agencies.

So I suggest asking yourself what is the market competition like, what kind of backing do I have and what am I willing to throw at it.  I believe cash is king so in general I wouldnâ€™t go down this road at start-up phase.
