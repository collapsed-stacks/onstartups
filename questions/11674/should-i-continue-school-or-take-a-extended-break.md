I just received some bad news from my college finance office which basically translates to I need to come up with around 6k to finish my degree program. I am trying to calculate the return on time invested trying to search for scholarships, or spend time building my product so that I can fund the rest of my school when I get into a profitable state.  

I am a non-traditional student who's sole purpose of going back to school was to obtain a degree in order to look more credible  to potential clients and investors.  I guess what I am asking is should I spend time developing product or should I spend time scouring for and applying for scholarships that I can hopefully piece meal together to finish my degree?

and welcome to this site! :-)

**Only you can decide what's best for you.** But allow me to tell you a little story.

I had a mentor in business once, a man more intelligent than I, but especially a man with  wisdom and warmth. Now, this was in the thick of the first dot-com crash, and the company we both worked for died.

So this man, he was in his fifties, he had held executive level jobs, and the last two companies he had worked in where not successes. The job market at the time didn't give him a chance. He was dumped like a hot potato. For executive level jobs there are many many applicants; and there was always someone younger or hotter in the race.

On the strength of his original academic degree (he had *excellent* grades) he got a good job in teaching. It pays well enough, is interesting, and keeps him on his toes.

IMHO the value in formal education is not so clearly seen when things are going great, and the economy is booming. But when you're having bad luck, and / or the economy is in recession, **a good education affords you more options and a certain safety net.** And know that life has its ups, and its downs.

Weigh the "how close you are to graduation" to "how realistic is it that you will go back after too long of a break" and how long is too long? 

Get a job or consult if you need to pay bills. Set aside time to look for grants (maybe a friend would look for a few hours a week?) and work on the product. Don't stop working on the product even if it means just a few hours a week.

In general, the ROI on grad school can be depressing, so that's why people usually pursue them for other reasons. It can offer more job opportunities and give you a chance to teach. An MBA may be the exception as far as increase in salary.

Good luck and keep us posted.
