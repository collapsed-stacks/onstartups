Is there any way to set up an affiliate program to market android or iPhone apps?  Where I can pay someone in a given market space (say "cooking for diabetics") for each app installed as a result of their blog?

<p>You're talking about creating a "pay per install" network. You want to look through the <a href="http://code.google.com/mobile/analytics/docs/android/#referrals" rel="nofollow">documentation on tracking referrers to the Android Market</a>, which will allow you to give a site a unique link to use to promote the app, and allow you to track how many installs come from that particular referrer.</p>

iTunes has an affiliate program but it is not as mature as internet site affiliate type sites. Read more here http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/

<p><a href="http://www.appbrain.com" rel="nofollow">Appbrain.com</a> have a pay per install advertising service, they advertise your App on their website and in their App and you only pay if the user actually installs the App. I believe this is android only, and you need to publish your app first and have a few ratings before they allow you to promote your App.</p>
