<p>For some time I was involved in tech startups a lot, and obviously used the lean methodology. </p>

<p>Some time ago though, I got an interesting offer from a corporate (one of the largest meat processors in EU) to run a spin-off of their company. (I do have some experience in food tech/microbio).</p>

<p>So this is what I am doing now. And obviously food industry, as most of you perhaps guess, is as stale and reluctant to innovation as it gets. </p>

<p>I am trying to structure the spin-off around lean principles, but there is 1 massive question I don't know how to get around. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Food industry has always worked by the principle of 'sell what you produce' rather than the normal today 'produce what you sell'. It's just how things work here - we discover a new recipe and we push it. The problem is - today's retailers have gathered so much bargaining power and are so risk averse that 'pushing' happens once a year, takes another year to implement and eventually may fail anyway.</p>

<p>My vision is to reverse this and build a consumer-oriented food enterprise that would ship new products to market quickly, and, more importantly, in response to consumer needs. So here's the question:</p>

<p>How to get around the retail structure?</p>

<p>I appreciate how wishy-washy this is. Just throw anything at me, I'm really happy to consume any ideas.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
