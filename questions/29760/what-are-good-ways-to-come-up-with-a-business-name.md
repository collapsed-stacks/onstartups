I have been working at this non-stop for almost a year now, and I can't come up with any names that aren't taken.

At this point, I am exhausted.

**Does anyone have any ideas for thinking of a name?**

If you have $200, go to crowdspring.com, post your project, and dozens and dozens of creative people all over the world will give you suggestions. 

p.s.: I am not affiliated in any way to crowdspring.com. I just think it works wonders.

The name really doesn't mean too much. Just name it and concentrate on building up your reputation as great a customer service, great value, great price etc. etc.

A slogan would be more useful than wasting time on a name, like:

"The Huge Long Named Open Source Solutions Company" - "Need Help With Your Open Source Software? We're Your One Stop Solution".

Hell, that isn't that great, but I only spent maybe 20 seconds on it. Concentrate on what you'll do for your clients and what value you'll bring, rather than worrying about a name.

Eg. What really does Pepsi, Coke, Yashoo or Google mean before you knew what they did? It's more about what they do for you that counts.

Might I suggest PCOpener.com? It relates to PCs, open source, and the .com is available (at the time I write this).

It also includes the subtlety of the fact that you open up computer use to others who could not otherwise afford it.

<p>There are no rules to naming a startup. And most entrepreneurs do assume that the name they choose will change before their businesses really start to gain momentum.</p>

<p>Consequently, it doesn't shock us that some of our favorite startups were sired by picking names out of hats, by throwing out odd proper nouns that might be cheap domain names and by haphazardly removing vowels.</p>

<p>Ever wonder what a "Twitter" is, or who the "Hipmunk" is? We've asked nine startups to share the story behind their names.</p>

<p>This is an excerpt from the article on <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/05/startup-names/" rel="nofollow">Mashable</a></p>

<p>As what A. Garcia had said you could try crowd sourcing websites when you <a href="http://www.squadhelp.com/" rel="nofollow">need help naming your business</a></p>
