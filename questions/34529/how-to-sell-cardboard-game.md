Okay. I have a prototype and design of a cardboard game. 
I need to figure out a way of selling it.I was thinking: print a small volume and sell on amazon, ebay and related websites? or contact some company that deals with cardboard games?
How can I sell my game in walmart, for example?

I agree Amazon is better for established products.  On the other hand, it doesn't cost anything to list your product on Amazon, and the number of buyers is huge, so you'll get some page views.  Your sales won't take off overnight, but they could build into something meaningful over time.  You can also send one of your games to a 'professional reviewer' for free to get a review on Amazon, that will definitely help.

I think spending the money to build a small number of games (10 - 20?) and look for groups on Facebook, LinkedIN, Gamer Blogs, etc. to distribute the game to for free for feedback first. I'd also look for some niche game e-commerce sites that already have an audience of game players looking for something new different. The big stores like Amazon, etc.do really well with brands and products that are already known - they aren't as great for breaking new products unless there is a large marketing push behind it.

Good Luck!

Looks like you want to get into a very competive market.  I would definately not carry too much stock of the game.  You can use sites like you mentioned as well as Etsy.com.  You should also pitch to independant hobby/game shops.  It's best to start small and build a fanbase and word-of-mouth sales.  

I would also try to get these shops interested early enough in the year that you can fill an order before the holiday buying season.  I would only produce large quantities if there is a legitimate order placed. Consider your manufacturing time.  If you start pitching early in the year and get a sale, you can have the product manufactured in time for the winter holidays.  If you focus starting out on the holiday season, you will likely see greater sales that can help with revenue in a consolidated period of time.  Of course, this doesn't necessarily apply to your independant online sales through the mentioned sites or your own website.  

If you gain momentum (profitibility, increased demand, volumes that can lower manufacture costs), you might want to think about licensing.  I would wait until you could prove strong growth over time (year-over-year, it's going to take time), so they take you more seriously and may give you a better offer.  Getting an independantly produced game in a major retail store without a lot of marketing capital and store placement will just mean a more expensive death since there is so much name brand competition with the best placement and brand awareness.  You could end up losing *everything* to expenses at the majors instead of making *something* from the independants.

<p>I think you might want to listen to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p006czx8" rel="nofollow">Richard Tait telling the story of Cranium</a>. It's an entertaining story - with a really smart approach to initial development of the board game, some disasters (such as messing up the timing and landing up with a container of games and no distribution at all), some triumphs and a fairy tale exit.</p>

<p>The lessons I learned were:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the first case, it's all about creating a game that other people love and want to play again and again</p></li>
<li><p>Once you're there, find any way you can to get your game into the hands of people who can help you</p></li>
<li><p>Then you're ready to engage with professional buyers (and, of course, the right angel investor could open doors with and for you)</p></li>
<li><p>And if the doors don't open, get creative: find any and every way you can to get your game on sale in stores - even just a few</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck! If you create compelling play value, you deserve to reach the point where those retailers are coming to you!</p>
