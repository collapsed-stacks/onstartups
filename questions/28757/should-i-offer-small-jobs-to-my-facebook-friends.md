I use Elance.com to hire writers to write high quality, unique content for a few websites that I own.

I usually pay about $10-$15 an article on Elance and have received surprisingly great content from knowledgeable people in a given field.

I was about to post another listing on Elance but then I thought... "Maybe I'll post a Facebook status seeing if any of my network of friends want the work first".

I'm sort of torn because $10-$15 an article is a low wage in the USA (where I live), but I also know there are some friends on there who would probably take it (e.g. stay at home Mom's, friends still in college, etc).

I'm also thinking it's best to keep friends as friends and keep business as business.

Does anybody have expereince with this?

It's best to keep friends as friends but this is not particularly high-stakes business. 

I'd ask the question, do you risk your reputation with your friends for being as cheap as Elance ad placers? That appears to be the only area of risk I can see. 

My opinion is that a personal relationship with someone makes them a known and therefore their work output (if you believe that they are capable) is more of a known quantity than an unknown person on Elance. Therefore I would personally be inclined to pay someone I already know a bit more than minimum wage. 

Of course that often works out badly, because the meatspace friend may feel that they can take advantage of the relationship. 

I'd probably hire such inexpensive work on the "downlow", all factors considered. You're mixing elements together here that are not meant to be mixed.

I don't think I would advertise to the world that I'm outsourcing all my content writing for my websites for $10 - $15/hr.  Probably because you are charging / the value of that service to the end client is much greater than that.  Your clients could easily see your Facebook statuses and how you work.

If you do want to have friends help you out. Send them direct messages of the opportunities.
