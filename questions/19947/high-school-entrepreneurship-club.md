I am a High School Business teacher and I have had a couple of students ask to start an Entrepreneurship Club.  I have looked everywhere and cannot find anything at the State level for high school.  Tons of stuff for college but the age group limits what we can and cannot do at the high school level.  If anyone has anything and would love to share, I would GREATLY appreciate it!!!!!

Thank you!

Great idea! I was class president in high school and would have loved to start a business club. If were to become a highschool teacher, I would definitely do that now.

Looking back on my former self (I'm 23 now) this is would I should have learned in high school based on what's happening to me now:

- Read some books together about starting a business. I recommend Founders at Work, How to Win Friends and Influence People, and Delivering Happiness to start. Those will keep you busy.

- Basics about business (Revenues - expenses = profits, how to get customers, how to maintain customer support, how to scale your business, etc.) That stuff is exciting and will give anyone interested in your business club a leg up when they get into business school.

- Lastly, nothing teaches you how to do something than having to do it. Why not just start a business? Sell breakfast sandwiches and make the kids do the order, customer service, clean up, scheduling, etc. You could have them start a t-shirt company. It does really matter what you sell, as long as you incorporate what you're teaching into the program. I think this would be most exciting for kids, and teach them how to work on a team and respect the hard workers, and not necessarily the "popular" kids.

As for resources on where to start...I can't help you there. I'll keep looking though. Good luck!

<p>I've volunteered for <a href="http://www.ja.org/" rel="nofollow">Junior Achievers</a> in the past.  That seems like a pretty great organization.  Maybe you should look at starting one of these in your community.</p>
