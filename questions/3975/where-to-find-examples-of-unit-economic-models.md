We're meeting with a VC on the east coast right now and they've asked us for a "unit economic" model.  I'm pretty familiar with a pro forma financial model but not as familiar with unit economic model.  Does anyone have any good examples of this?  Maybe a template on the web or something?

Also, is this a fairly standard question or do you think this is an example of a VC running us in circles just to see if we'll run?

From my experience with this, the unit economic model is the a break-even analysis but in terms of the number of widgets that need to be sold to break-even. It sounds like you have most of the data, you just have to divide by your Revenue by your ASP and that should be close.

I don't know of any models out there for it. I have been asked this before because they want to see if the unit ramp "scales" in a reasonable way but it was always a side question -- not a formal request.
