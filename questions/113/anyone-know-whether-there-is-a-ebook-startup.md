I was wondering, does anyone know of any good ebook writer/providers out there for self publishing? For example, I want to be able to write the book and publish in pdf/html on the site, or perhaps import latex file or something.

thanks a lot!

Jason

<p><a href="http://www.lulu.com/" rel="nofollow">Lulu</a> is great.</p>

<p>They take Word, PDF, etc..  If you want to give it away for free, they'll do it for free too.</p>

<p>If you want to make money, they'll do all the fulfillment and getting money.  Plus you can offer it as a bound book too!  (For money of course.)</p>

You can also try Clickbank.
And for print-publishing, try CreateSpace



But you're better off figuring out how to market yourself. Selling is the real skill. Content creation without marketing is a commodity. Not a good place to be.

Start blogging. Build traffic. Sell your own content to your own community.
