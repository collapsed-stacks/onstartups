I'm starting a business that helps small businesses build and maintain a website. I will be managing most aspects of the website, including domain names and email addresses. I like the idea of setting my clients up with Google Apps Standard Edition so that all I have to do is point the MX records to their servers. I guess I have a few questions about this:

 1. Does anyone have any experience doing this?
 2. What legal issues should I be aware of?
 3. How can I promote this feature on my website? Am I free to use Google's name so long as I include a TM?
 4. Is there a way for me to (legally) automate the creation of accounts?

<p>Google actually has a reseller program that you might be interested in: <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/resellers/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/resellers/index.html</a></p>

<p>I don't know if you can officially "resell" the standard edition since it's free, but I bet you can get answers to all your questions on that website even if you don't sign up for that program.</p>

This may not be the type of automation your after but standard edition does provide ways to bulk create users and offers API's and desktop utilities for migration from existing mail providers.  I personally have not used these features but you can access them from the "Advanced Tools" tab when logged in as an administrator.

I have started the same concept and have the website up and running already - www.cloudarya.com. I have personally setup a client using the standrad edition and didn't have any issue with that - and also the customer just loved it. I also got a customer who wants to have the application built and deployed on Google Apps Engine - utilizing the Google spreadsheet and big table, which we are looking at currently - we are thinking this application can be marketed to other industries. We also have an idea on utilizing  Google Health and doing EDI on Google, which is very unique because we haven't seen one yet. On top of that we have built the an application that wraps up google services - docs, spreadsheet, calendar and so forth so that companies don't need to traverse through multiple URLs. There are a lot of concepts but looking for some help to materialize these ideas in terms of business plan and marketing and investments. If anyone interested doing the partnership or help me startup then that would be really helpful. I also have EMR and Clearinghouse concepts that may be able to tap some portion of the healthcare spendings in coming days. Please shoot me an email if anyone is interested in hearing from me.

Thanks
