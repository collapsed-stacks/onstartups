I am launching a new product this week. Basically, it's an educational series of PDFs and video instructions. Not a membership site, but more like a multimedia ebook.

Since this is the first version, I want to test to make sure it's good and valuable. As many would be, I am a little nervous about selling something and I want to get good feedback.

I have a list of about 75 interested emails (used LaunchRock to promote) and I was thinking of offering them a 1/2 price discount to start and then a full refund if they provide feedback (set up some type "rules" i.e. you have to make one suggestion for improvement and detail one thing you liked the most/why or if they love it, write a testimonial). This would help me improve the product on the negative comments and provide good sales material for those who love it. 

I am suggesting the refund idea because giving it away for free and then asking for feedback will generate nothing while I do want to reward those for taking the time to help.

Anyone tried this? Thoughts or things I am missing?

How are you taking payment? If it is by credit card your merchant account may prohibit this type of action, or they may charge you for doing multiple refunds, or they might cancel your account. 

If you have a relatively new merchant account, taking in 100 charges and then refunding 50 of them is going to look like a defective service/product to the credit card provider.

I don't think you should offer refunds for feedback.  You might be surprised how many people are happy to give feedback if you make it easy enough.  Even a follow up email to ask what they thought would probably be enough.

Another few reasons not to:

 1. It devalues your product, it makes it look like you don't think it's worth anything.  Put a price on your product and stick to it.  Don't feel like you don't deserve their money.
 2. If they are giving feedback because they get "paid for feedback", then you will get feedback even if they don't have anything of interest to say.  They will just be trying to get a refund rather than actually help.
 3. Read Gary's comment, he is spot on.

You don't say what the offer is all about but I would offer a relevant prize, but one which is highly motivational.  Simply getting your money back doesn't cut it and in fact its more likely to put people off since it might appear even you don't think its worth what you're charging.
