I am really no good at B2C marketing, but this is the first thing that jumped into my mind for pre-event PR: 

Distribute it in advance to key celebrity bloggers with the "inside" knowledge that it will be in the grab bag. Include something that says "You're getting it before Brad Pitt" or "Have you ever scored before Angelina?" so that they open up the package and take out the sample. Include an easy way to link to your website to learn more about and to link to your Facebook Fan page to befriend you. Make sure you follow up with each on if they liked it. Monitor their blogs so that you can promote any positive reviews or mentions of your product. 

Any more detailed and helpful of an answer would require a little more specificity about the nature of the product.
