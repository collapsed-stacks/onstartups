I am planning at a new startup and would like to a-b-test several elements (such as the brand name / logo / sales pitch) before the actual product launch.

Ideally, I would love to pay a service money to show two versions to a lot of users and have them pick their favorite. Of course, once the service launches there will be a-b-testing with the real-world users as well - this is only for the pre-launch phase.

The only general service that to my knowledge is currently suited to do this is Amazon's Mechanical Turk which is unfortunately unavailable for Non-Americans.

A Google search for paid questionnaires turned up a lot of services that allowed users to **take** the questionnaires but none that allowed me to post one for pay.

The key is that the people taking the questionnaire have to be provided and either micro-paid by us or paid by the service-provider with us paying for the service. (As opposed to a classic questionnaire where we provide our own users.)

Are there any (trustworthy) services for this purpose? A breakdown of gender, age and location groups for the answering people as well as the ability to leave detailed feedback would be perfect but ultimately a simple percentage voting will do as well. Also, pointers on other ways to reach the same results are also greatly appreciated.

<p>How about this list - <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-crowdsourcing-services-similar-to-Amazon-Mechanical-Turk" rel="nofollow">"Quora - What are some crowdsourcing services similar to Amazon Mechanical Turk?"</a></p>

<p>Some are alternatives, some are meta-platforms built on top of mtuk and may not have the same US-only restriction.</p>

If appropriate to your market audience, you could try testing a variety of Facebook ads and work out which is working the best by the click through rates you get.
