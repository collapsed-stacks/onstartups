I've been asked to review a few advertising systems by my employer.

1. Google Ad Manager looks like a safe choice but it puts all our eggs in one basket.

2. OpenX is another safe choice but I want more than it currently delivers.

3. [Trafficspaces][1] looks awesome but it has only been around for about a year - 
I'm stuck. Any help will be welcome.

Are you looking to manage your own ad program? I.e., work closely with advertisers to help setup campaigns, and so on... or will it be self-service?

If it's the former, I'd consider BanManPro, That's the software we use for The Daily WTF and Stack Overflow and it seems to a do a decent job. The interface isn't all too great, but it's a few hundred bucks, so it's hard to beat the price
