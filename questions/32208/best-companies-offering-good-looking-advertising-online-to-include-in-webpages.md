Other than AdSense, you can check out Yahoo YPN, Kontera, Chitika, AdBrite, InfoLinks, BidVisor and ClickSor. They are all best Google AdSense alternatives and people trust them as well.

Check out this reference URL for further illustration http://www.bestadsensealternatives.info/. I hope it will help you.
