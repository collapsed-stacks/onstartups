I'm the founder of an interests based social network. A well known advice for promoting a startup launch says I should identify key bloggers, and introduce my startup to targeted early adopters.

Well, the problem is that my startup is targeted to pretty much everyone above the age of 13.

I'd like to ask what's the best way to narrow down the "good targeted" bloggers list when my startup is a social network?

Look for bloggers who hate Facebook. Or blogs for early adoptors.
