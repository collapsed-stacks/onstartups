I am setting up a Web Design and Development business and planning to outsource development services to Eastern Europe (not part of EU). I am wondering what sort of working contract can UK registered Sole Trader have with person outside EU?

Thanks!
Marko

I don't think the question is what kind of contract can you have, but rather: "How would you enforce the contract?"
