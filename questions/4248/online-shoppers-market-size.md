"Infinite," and "bigger every year."

If you're planning a company or planning to raise money, the market size is so big that it's unnecessary to quantify.  Focus on how you're going to address the market in the whirlwind of competitors, not what micro-percent of the massive market  you need to "acquire."

<p>This <a href="http://www.couponsherpa.com/ask-coupon-sherpa/30-top-online-shopping-trends/" rel="nofollow">link</a> from Coupon Sherpa may be of use to you. It addresses only USA though. </p>

<p>Quoting from that website -</p>

<ul>
<li>More than half of Internet users -- totaling $875 million Americans -- make at least one online purchase per month.</li>
<li>Online shopping is forecast to reach $329 billion by 2010 -- increasing to 13 percent of all retail sales and encompassing almost half of all households.</li>
</ul>
