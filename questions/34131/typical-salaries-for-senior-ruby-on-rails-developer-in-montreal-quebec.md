What is a typical salary for a senior (with 3 years of experience) Ruby on Rails developer in Montreal?
And how much does it cost totally to the employer?

Thanks

You could probably look at the [Payscale](http://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Country=Canada/Salary) website to see what the salary should be.

I found [this document](http://www.cpq.qc.ca/assets/files/dossiers/2009/dossier0509_en.pdf) giving an estimate of what it might cost an employer in Quebec.
