What if I am traveling internationally, and want calls forwarded to my local number?

Google Voice only forwards to US phone numbers.
What service should I use to forward calls to my local number?

I use skype-in numbers and forward them anywhere in the world.

<p>I use <a href="http://www.tollfreeforwarding.com/" rel="nofollow">TollFreeForwarding.com</a> and in addition to standard forwarding, they provide their customer with a full featured customizable voice menus!</p>

When you travel internationally take your MagicJack, Vonage Box, or my personal favorite NetTalk Duo.  

If you use any of these services for your call in number they will work almost anywhere that you have decent internet.   If not, you can always forward your main line to your NetTalkDuo number, and you are set!
