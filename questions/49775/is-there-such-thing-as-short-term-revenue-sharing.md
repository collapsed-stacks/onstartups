I have an iOS game that I need developed. I wanted to know if I can make a deal with a third party developer where we share revenue for the first year or two (50/50). I just do not feel it is fair to share revenue long term because I have designed the graphics, features, and will be doing all the marketing for the game. I also will be hiring my own development team to continuously work on the game. The developers and I both believe that the game will be successful. If the developer is willing to take an upfront payment for a large sum, would it not be a better deal to share revenue for a short term and they would make more in the long run? 

Does that seem fair? And if it doesn't, is there a way to make it fair while keeping revenue sharing short term? Please help. Thanks.

One problem with this is that you could sit on it until the bulk of their earning potential is gone, then release.  They then end up with 2 months of money and 22 months of nothing.

A fairer thing for both is to set a price of $X to be paid out of gross earnings 50/50.  You probably should factor in some percentage 4-8%/year on any unpaid amount.  If they would build it for 100K, then if you never earn 200K, they never get their money, but if you earn $1Mil, they are out at 100K.
