The best advice I got was to pick an attainable target and put yourself into their shoes. Where do they hangout online? What magazines do they read? What conferences do they go to?

Then just find the hangouts, magazines, and conferences and start pitching. Pay attention to responses and overtime you can tweak the approach and messaging until it works consistently.

Good luck!
