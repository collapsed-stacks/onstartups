<p>You need to contact the right holders and their representatives in India. <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/" rel="nofollow">MPAA</a> for example represents many of the right owners in the US. Not necessarily all of them, but you can start with them. They have <a href="http://www.mpaa-india.org/aboutus.html" rel="nofollow">presence in India</a>.</p>
