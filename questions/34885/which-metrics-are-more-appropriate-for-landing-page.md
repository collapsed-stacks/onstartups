right know I have an idea that would like to test out and would like to know which metrics are regularly used to understand why people are signing in or not.

So far I have just Google Analytics, and 1 goal which is conversion rate, so I just measure how many people sign for the newsletter out of the total.

Did you do A/B testing with the landing page? Did you use any particular tool to accomplish this that would recommend? 

Could you shed some light on the process of choosing metrics?

The basic metrics for a landing page include: 

'Bounce Rate' (which can be higher than usual if all you want is an email signup on the landing page itself and nothing more)

'Avg. Time on Page' - your design and content needs to keep them there long enough to lead to a conversion

'Pages Viewed per Visit' - not applicable if you have a one-page site

'Referring Sources' - provides invaluable insight into *how* people are finding your page. 

The goal you have created is of course the most direct measurement of whether people are doing what you want them to do; set a goal for the conversion rate, at say, 2%, and then yes, by all means, A/B test multiple landing pages with different copy, with different email signup locations, etc. to see what your particular users engage with the most. How (with what external links) people are finding your landing page will impact the ease in which you can create multiple landing pages, and the multiple links needed to direct people to each. 

Just be sure this page clearly spells out *the benefits to the user* of entering their email address and giving up personal information...
