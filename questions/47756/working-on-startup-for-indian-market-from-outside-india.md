I am working on a Software application designed for Indian market from outside India. I have a partner (in India) who knows the Indian market and knows the domain of the application inside-out (15 years). We know there is a demand for the product.
 
The question is prob. for someone who has worked/lived in India and in foreign country. What are the things that we need to consider when developing new product in India?. The question is not regarding usual hurdles like late client payments, corruption etc but challenges a new entrepreneur faces when developing new business or launching first product at national level?

Thanks
