I believe usually 3 directors are required. Is there a way around this?

Interesting. I have a corporation here in Ontario, and there is one director - myself. I believe that you require a president and secretary, but the same person can serve as both.

In Ontario you can register a corporation with 1 member. Call your accountant or lawyer and he/she will do it for you or do it online it's simple
