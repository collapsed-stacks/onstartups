I'm planning on setting up a new business in the UK and gather I need a "Memorandum of Association". How important is this for a one-man company? Unbelievably, googling it does not yield any example documents.

<p>As a principle, I would recommend <strong>using an agent</strong> - they supply all this kind of thing and it costs about GBP 50 to get the company registered including a standard set of paperwork - see <strong><a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/26110/uk-ltd-company-formation-agent-advice-and-pitfalls">this question</a></strong> for some suggestions.  My view is that unless this is your core competency, your time and effort could be better spent that on the fine details of company formation.</p>

<p>Having said that, from 1 October 2009, there was a change in UK company law which meant that a separate Memorandum of Association was no longer required - the official registration form you submit to create the company is effectively the memorandum of association - it states who the intended shareholders are, that they wish to form a company and that they agree to be shareholders of it.</p>

<p>Separately, you will need a set of 'Articles of Association' or 'Articles' for short - this is the document that states what activities your business is permitted to conduct (i.e. it's own house rules, if you like).  A standard set of articles usually let's you do anything that's legal; however, it is unlikely to matter much until you come to sell your company (for many millions :-) of course).</p>

<p>A good book to understand what's involved in starting and running a UK limited company is <strong><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1846612616" rel="nofollow">"Running a Limited Company"</a></strong> by David Impey &amp; Nick Montague (although make sure to get the latest edition).</p>

Explanatory Note (p6) (note the "Schedules" are included in the pdf):

>    The Companies Act 2006 (c.46) makes changes to the form of a company’s constitutional 
documents. The Companies Act 1985 (c.6) and the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 (S.I. 
1986/1032 (N.I. 6)) both require a company to include a substantial amount of information in its 
memorandum of association and allow a company’s constitutional rules to be divided between its 
memorandum and articles of association. Under the Companies Act 2006 all the constitutional 
rules will be contained in the articles of association; the memorandum of association will be a 
much shorter document. 


>    Regulation 2 prescribes the form of the memorandum of association required under the Companies 
Act 2006. The forms in Schedules 1 and 2 serve the limited purpose of providing evidence of the 
intention of each subscriber to form a company and become a member of that company and, in the 
case of a company that is to have a share capital on formation, to take at least one share.
