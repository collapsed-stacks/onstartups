We're a small company of 4-6 developers/designers. We have bizspark so we get free software. Now I see Microsoft Dynamics CRM available to us and from what I understand, it helps us with customer relation management. We deal with clients who want websites and software solutions built.

Is a CRM like dynamics suitable for us? Should we spend the time to learn and integrate it?

<p>If your startup is less than 10 people and CRM Dynamics requires you to <em>"spend time to learn and integrate it"</em> then it is not the solution for your business. You need a lighter and simpler solution, I recommend you look at <a href="http://www.zoho.com/crm/index.html" rel="nofollow">Zoho CRM</a>, <a href="http://highrisehq.com/" rel="nofollow">Highrise</a> or even <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/" rel="nofollow">SugarCRM</a>.</p>
