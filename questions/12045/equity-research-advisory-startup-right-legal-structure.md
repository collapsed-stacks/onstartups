I have a few questions: 

1. Whether LLC or LLP is better for equity research advisory business? Or there should be any other legal structure? 
2. Can LLC be registered in Ontario (Canada)?
3. If there is only one owner involved, and would like to limit potential liabilities; then what is the feasible legal structure?

<p>There was a question previously asked on this site that answers some of your questions:</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/1572/is-there-a-canadian-equivalent-of-an-llc" rel="nofollow">Is there a Canadian equivalent of an LLC?</a></p>

<p>In the US you can register a one person LLC. However, from your question it appears that you reside in Canada - not sure what the laws are in Canada.</p>
