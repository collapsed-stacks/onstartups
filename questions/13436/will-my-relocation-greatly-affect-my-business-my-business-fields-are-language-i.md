I am building my own business and tentatively I will go into business interpretation, real estate market, travel market, and international trade market. I am trilingual and I like to travel around the world and meet people from different countries.What about my choice? If I live in a country for some years then move to another country, will my relocation significantly affect my business? Can I live a good life by going into those markets? What can I do in these fields in order to achieve financial freedom in a relatively short period, say, 5 to 10 years?

My god. Seriously - if you think 3 minutes about those questions, then - guess what, you ahve the answer.

No, you will TRY to go into those. Having 4 different and not related main business means you will not have the time in ANY of them to actually do a decent job.

Absolutely not. All the customers you know will suddenly be interested in buying real estate in your new location and / or all you inventory you can sell to them will magically reappear in the new location with you, too.

How the hell do you even get the delusion that a local dependant business will NOT be affected by you moving to another country?

Well, given your guestions adn the fact that you like doing a couple of things, I am sure YOU can NOT live a decent live in a short period. That requires dedication and focus - and you definitely lack focus already. You have to work on that.

If you focus in ONE area, and actualyl are willing to put in some real work (and not move from country to country every other year) then it MAY be you can build a business, that you MAY be able to sell. Main problem here is... you are not alone in those markets, so even if you would be focused and a hard worker.... basically... a lot of luck is involved.

You are much better off with a location independant career. You know, something like prodessional gold player, professional poker player, professional blackjack player (yes, the later two exist and you CAN make a LOT of money as those).

If oyu want to move around and have financial freedom, strive for something that:
* Earny you money without talking to epople at your location
* Doesn ot involve customers where you have to be local
* Does only invlove an infrastructure that you can put into one place regardless where you are.

One of my business ventures is like that. No customers (technically: one customer), computers in one place in a data center and all I need is a decent high quality internet connection.
