I need more vendors to join my startup, likebids.com, but I only have 10 so far. Can anyone give me more information on where to find the right advertisers that would be interested in our concept?

The concept is this: vendors give away one product free in each auction to the top bidder. The top bidder wins the product free by referring friends/followers to click like/tweet and the user with the most shares wins. Also, users get discounts for a minimum amount of shares vendors give. 

Thanks in advance.

If you haven't worked out how to get users yet, you have a piece of software - not a business.

Have you established whether people actually want your service, who your customers are, whether they will pay for it, how will you make money?

If not, if I were you, I would take a step back from the website development and start talking to potential users. Then you will quickly find out if you have a go-er and how to find the users that would be interested.

The vendors that will be most interested in your company will have budgets dedicated to acquiring likes & tweets. Try to chase those dollars.

At least three strategies to consider:

- leaders. Try to identify the brands that are already actively seeking likes/tweets. They probably have budgets for facebook. The top 10 or 20 may be hard to crack, but they might be willing to experiment with new technologies to get incremental likes/tweets. A few months old but this might be a starting place: http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/10/25/the-25-largest-brand-facebook-pages-with-most-likes/.
 
- new approaches. Monitor newsflow on brands that seem to try new things: http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/02/21/featured-facebook-campaigns-zynga-oreo-nba-pizza-hut-subaru-and-black-eyed-peas/

- complementary services. Think about who else has a similar value proposition as you and identify their customers. an example might be: http://hootsuite.com/
