Once the BizSpark program ends for me is there a low cost solution for getting access to tools like Visual Studio?

I've seen before people talk about $300 or $400 annual subscriptions but I wasn't sure what that was for exactly.

If that entity can't get profitable in 3 years (enough to pay for msdn licenses) then it is probably a goner anyway.  Time to start a new venture...

What is it that you are using the BizSpak program for?
Is it to build your product/solution?
If this is the case, then you are being too slow bringing your product to life... as Tim mentioned, this might indicate that this venture is already dead!
 
Can you explain a little more what is it that you're doing and what are the longer term plans?

<p>You get to keep your Visual Studio licenses, and you <a href="http://www.microsoftstartupzone.com/BizSpark/Pages/FAQ.aspx#q9" rel="nofollow">must buy SPLA licenses (or the similar at that time) for your production servers</a>. SPLA is not low cost, but then again, BizSpark is intended for startups wanting to become successful companies, not hobby projects.</p>

Establish a new entity, transfer IP to new entity, outsource development to new entity, sign up for BizSpark with new entity, then repeat in 3 years.
