I have seen sites like klout.com used in measuring social influence of people. I want to know if it's possible to develop a payment system where people pay using their social influence. For example we can have:

Pay with Facebook  
Pay with Twitter

I want to know if it's a violation of any terms or policy of the these social networks.

I'm very much concerned about the policy of such system.

Stanley, I don't think this would work for Facebook. I am not a lawyer, but it would seem to specifically break their Platform Policy:

> You must not incentivize users to use (or gate content behind the use of) Facebook social channels, or imply that an incentive is directly tied to the use of our channels.

And from their Terms of Service:

> You will not show third party ads or web search boxes on Facebook.
