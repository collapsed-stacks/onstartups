I'm an independent game developer with a team consisting of solely of myself. I am considering to hire a Creative Director who will help me complete my projects. I am promising 10% of the revenue gained from the project we are working on. I'd like to make it official with documentation so that there will be no problems in the future.

How do you write a contract for Revenue Sharing?

Having done this myself, and seen others do similar, there's a lot of things that need to be considered, most of which will be based on your unique situation. Therefore the advice I would give is: **via a lawyer.**
