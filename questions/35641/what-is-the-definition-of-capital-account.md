It seems that it's a virtual term. It is not a bank account. It is the net result of gains-losses. And it seems that there are two types of such accounts â€“ the llc's, and members'. The account should be recorded, but the record is not "the account", it is a record thereof.

Is this correct?

EDIT: (Since I got two answers referring me to Wikipedia.)
I've seen the Wikipedia entry _before_ posting my question. It tells us that this is included in something else and also the number of these. It does _not_ tell us if this is a bank account or a file (whether paper or computer) or just a number.

<p>Capital account is an accounting/bookkeeping term. It is used to represent an owner's equity in the business. It is <strong>not</strong> a bank account.</p>

<p>With respect to an LLC, you will set up a capital account on your LLC's <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/a/13025">books</a> for each member.</p>

<p>A member's capital account represents the current value of that member's percentage of ownership interest. It is the total of a member's contributions to the LLC, adjusted by his share of profits or losses in the LLC.</p>

<p>Side note: Please don't take this the wrong way, I'm only trying to help. You have asked a couple of fairly basic questions recently. I think you would benefit a lot from reading a basic book on starting a business. I suggest picking up a copy of <a href="http://www.nolo.com/products/legal-guide-for-starting-and-running-a-small-business-RUNS.html" rel="nofollow">Legal Guide for Starting &amp; Running a Small Business</a>. Also, take a look at <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/13694/can-you-recommend-one-or-two-books-that-will-explain-the-process-of-creating/13704#13704">my answer here</a> with more recommendations on getting started. But don't spend all of your time reading. At some point you need to actually start doing.</p>

**From Wikipedia**

Do not know what is the reference to virtual here. What has been mentioned is NOT correct. Capital account is a very important account and concept in financial account. What exactly is the question? I feel given the quality of this board, the question should be more serious and proper.
