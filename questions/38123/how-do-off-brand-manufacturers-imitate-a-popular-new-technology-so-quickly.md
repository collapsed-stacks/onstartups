## How do off-brand manufacturers imitate a popular, new technology so quickly?

While I was reading on my Kindle this morning, I thought about how many other kinds of similar E-Ink readers there are now (Sony's, Kobo, Aluratech, Nook). I realize Kindle wasn't the first E-Ink reader, but my question scopes a lot of technology industries: why all the others all of a sudden?

For example, the iPhone and iPad seemed to start a whirl of buzz about multi-touch screens, both small and large. Now there are several major offshoot brands (and even major brands) with similar technology. As I understand it, though, that technology was "new," as in: nobody had developed it at a reasonable price before.

Similar spurs of innovation could be seen from the notebook computer, flip-top phones, MP3 players, hard disks, flash drives, web startups (complex back-end network infrastructures like cloud computing), etc.

One company comes up with a practical way to distribute or apply the new technology and then all of a sudden, everyone else does.

**What enables other companies to release similar, innovative products about the same time as others?** Yes, I know it is to compete, but how do they figure out the technology so quickly? Did they happen to be developing it at the same time themselves? Do they reverse-engineer the leading brand? Practically, how do they do it?

I suspect that knowing something can (or will) be done is a great motivator for "invention".

Before something is announced, it may seem impossible, or at least not viable, but if you know that your competitor is going to be doing something that can easily spur you into action.
