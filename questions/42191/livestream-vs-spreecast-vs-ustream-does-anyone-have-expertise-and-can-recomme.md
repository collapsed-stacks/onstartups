My company is about to do a webinar via Spreecast. The folks there are very helpful but there are some problematic UI issues and feature limitations. I just had someone recommend Livestream to me. And then Ustream.

We are doing webinars that could have anywhere from 100 to 700 participants. Pretty basic stuff - 1 to 3 people who'd be on screen at once. A broad audience, not always technically savvy.

Any help appreciated!

Why not Gotowebinar? I use them and while I like their technology, I REALLY LIKE that when I screw up something they have excellent support and can usually solve my problems.
