So you have decided to hire some interns... You don't have much time to go to a college/university and get the word out... where do you find the best interns for software development? I know of craigslist.org, are there any other places?

<p>We've used four different approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Job Board</strong> - not craiglist, but I think cleveland.com/jobs or something. We had a lot of non-interns apply, even though it was posed in the intern section. In the end, we couldn't find a single candidate.</li>
<li><strong>Blog-based Job Board</strong> - we posted on <a href="http://hiddennetwork.com/" rel="nofollow">Hidden Network</a> and found one wonderful intern; but he was from Detroit (as opposed to our home town), which meant we paid extra for boarding</li>
<li><strong>College Career Board</strong> - we are basically on campus, and figured posting at Baldwin Wallace's careerboard would work. We got nothing. Not a single resume. For a paid, flexible-hour internship with offices on campus. It was seriously embarassing</li>
<li><strong>Ask College Professors / Students</strong> - baziiing! This was the goldmine. Once we made introduction to the professors, and told them about us and what we do, we had a steady stream of some of the best students. </li>
</ul>

<p>So in the end, we realized that... students first go to their profs for help, and the profs do what they can to help.</p>

Most of the University of Waterloo's students are actually required to complete 5~6 internships before they graduate, so their recruitment system is quite well established. Bonus points for students with existing industry experience. As a student there, I'm noticing that recently there has been an influx of startup companies looking for interns.

Just crossed my mind -- since most college students have a Facebook account, why not just start there? Announce it on your profile, join related groups, create a page, etc.

Here in Austin the University of Texas and St Edward's University make it pretty easy to find students interested in being interns.  

We've also had surprisingly great results in obtaining interns from a local high school that caters to gifted and talented students.

Personally I would never hire anyone from craigslist. The university is your best bet with out a doubt. Most universitys have a email list of students and you can send out a job opening through that, put the due date soon if you need a quick hire. Students are always looking for a good internship, you will be able to get someone eager to help.

I think you might be overestimating the amount of time investment college recruiting can be.  You can get by decently with little investment (obviously, if you put in more time you'll get better results though.)  If you can write up a couple paragraphs about your company (make it sound good to a college kid), the college career center will generally have a way for them to submit resumes to you through their web portal.  You don't have to throw an Info Session or attend a Career Fair (although it'd be a good idea) - and then take an afternoon to interview 5-10 kids for an internship.

Reach out to Entrepreneurship clubs at college campuses. The two most notable are probably Startups@Berkeley (ST@B) at UC Berkeley and BASES at Stanford. Both groups have job boards and members that are eager to join startups. This has been a great resource for staffing interns (and eventually full-time hires) at our company.

I don't know if the original question is valid. In general interns will cost you a lot of time. It's a two way thing right? They learn something from you or your company and the work they do is more or less for free. 

Getting interns up to speed/quality takes effort, and if you don't even have the time to search for them, I wouldn't advise any intern to come and work at the company.
