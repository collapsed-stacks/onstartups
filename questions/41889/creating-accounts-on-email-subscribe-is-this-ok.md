## Creating accounts on email subscribe - is this ok?

I'm working on a large initiative that involves allowing my blog visitors to subscribe for updates via email. Once they've subscribed, we offer them the opportunity to claim an account that's pre-populated with free software plugins & resources. No additional customer info is required for the account outside of their email address, and we do not send them any messages outside of what they've requested.

My question is, is this ok? Should I be aware of any potential conflicts with CAN SPAM or other relevant regulations?

I don't think you'll run into any legal issues, the problem is whether your users will feel they're getting an overly hard sell or not. Do you actually create the accounts upon them subscribing to your blog as the title suggests, or do you send them an email and only setup the account once they explicitly activate it?

It comes down to the personal marketing tolerance of the user, personal I would unsubscribe immediately in both cases, but you need a larger sample.
