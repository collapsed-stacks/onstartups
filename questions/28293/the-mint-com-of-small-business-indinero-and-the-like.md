I currently use mint.com to keep track of my personal finances and I love it! Is there an equivalent product in regards to quality/execution  for small businesses/startups? What does everyone here use in order to keep track of their business finances? So far I just use a plain excel worksheet (not much money coming in and out at the moment).

From doing some limited research I found the following...

Indinero: https://indinero.com/

Outright: http://outright.com/

Freshbooks: http://www.freshbooks.com/

Has anyone used this? What has your experience been?

<p>I've found <a href="http://www.xero.com" rel="nofollow">Xero</a> to be excellent, but it may be that it has a more Australian/NZ/UK bias than you might like - well worth checking out; I have no financial qualifications, but with a little guidance from my accountant, I can handle most activities very easily.  Billing via PDF over email is especially straightforward - handy if you're doing consulting work to support your start-up.</p>

Edgar I use:

Waveaccounting.com and 
Freshbooks.com

And those keep my life sane!
Waveaccounting imports all my bank and credit card data for reporting and taxes etc.

Freshbooks makes it easy to manage my accounts receivable and invoice.

Love it!

I'm using [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com) for my business and they've been pretty good. Invoicing is easy, clients are able to log in and view invoices, the interface is clean, quick and simple to use.

Have heard fantastic things about Xero as well.

My main gripe/pain point is probably the UK banking system. I'd like Mint.com's ability to automagically download transactions. For now I have to do reconciliation fairly manually.

QuickBooks online may be an option as well, but it's not free as well :(
