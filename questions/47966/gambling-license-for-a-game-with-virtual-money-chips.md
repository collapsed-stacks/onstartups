Do I need a specific license for operating a casino game (lets say poker Hold'em or video slot) that players are supposed to play with virtual money (chips) only? I am speaking about games like Zynga poker, Poker Deluxe, Slotomania and the hundreds other similar games on iTunnes or Google Play. Player starts with certain amount and if he run out of it he can rebuy a boundle of coins so to keep on playing... The users may not exchange those collected virtual funds (chips) for products or services, or cashing out for real money, but just keep on playing for a fun... So, do I need any license for operating such a game ?

Thanks in advance!!

<p>Doubt that EA requires a building permit to create sim city, or a gun permit to sell crysis3.  Since your game doesn't exchange actual money (or buildings or bullets) one would think that you would be okay. If you require a definitive answer, suggest ask a lawyer - since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL" rel="nofollow">IANAL</a>.  </p>
