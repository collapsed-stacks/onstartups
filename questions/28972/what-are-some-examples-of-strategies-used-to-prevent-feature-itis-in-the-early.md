Are their examples I can give to those that work with me to let them know, more features is not what we want at this point.

<p>I think the best thing to do is use an example like 37signals and basecamp. They made the most simplistic 'to do' list type of app and sold it as a project management tool. Thing didn't even have due dates :] and they were wildly successful.  Have them read '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=rework&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">rework</a>' by 37signals team. Their entire mantra is less, and you don't really need that feature you just think you do.  They say no to pretty much every feature, it takes a lot of battling to get them to add something new.</p>

<p>Also, use something like <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/" rel="nofollow">pivotal tracker</a> to track features, estimates, etc. so everyone can see what a new feature will take, what needs to be sacrificed, how it will affect timelines and you can order it's priority easily.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
