We are a gift baskets company and part of our business is through our web catalog, which is custom-built in WordPress. I've heard some people saying WordPress is not secure and we should not keep our user information in WordPress. Is there any truth to that?

We've been trying to learn about usability and shopping cart abandonment and apparently one reason for shopping cart abandonment is people simply want to save their cart contents to review other options and come back to complete the purchase. I'd like to give people that option but I don't know how to hold cart values inside user profiles - I don't know what system is best for all of that. 

What would you recommend for a company like us?

<p>You would get a better answer over at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" rel="nofollow">StackOverflow.com</a>.</p>

<p>To answer your question, WordPress is actually pretty secure - although I have never heard of it used as an e-commerce. Perhaps, mentioning what shopping cart plugin you use would help.</p>

From what I know (I work in association with two companies, one that does WordPress-type sites, and one that does eCommerce sites) is that WordPress is pretty secure, but it offers limited support for eCommerce within the framework. For that, you would either need a customized plugin, or just rebuild the site using a more standard eCommerce solution. 

If you want a referral to those two companies, just let me know. I took a quick look at your site, and it should not be too difficult to convert your site to an eCommerce platform from WordPress. Is there a reason you chose WordPress initially?
