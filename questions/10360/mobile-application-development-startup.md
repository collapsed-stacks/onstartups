I am in the begining stages of a startup that offers mobile app design, development, and marketing, but I can't afford to hire full time developers yet. Do you think I should hire them on a freelance basis? Or can I outsource the development of the app to individual developers and charge those developers a % commission? I still want to be the connection to the client and follow through with the app from concept to marketing, but I need to keep a low overhead. Also, where is the best place to find mobile developers that would be interested?

You claim to offer many services, but clearly you don't really have expertise or access to *all* of those services.

Maybe it would be best to decide which of those pieces -- design, dev, marketing -- you have something special to offer.  For example, reselling consulting hours from developers you're unable to vet isn't a business, whereas a new way to market mobile apps is.

That way, when it comes to the services you don't add value to -- e.g. development -- you're not worried about how to make money.

You can outsource the projects to mobile companies. As you can't afford the payment you can hire developers for part time. Freelancing the project will be a good idea as they work on less rates as compared to companies but also check their capabilities by seeing their work and their reviews as they will not leave you in the mid. You can post your project in freelancing sites or on on mobile forum where this type of discussions are going on.

I might be just a bit too late to reply but I will continue hoping that I could be a help in some way if not at-least to someone else. As you are looking for experienced experts in mobile development it would be much cheaper for you to outsource it. I'm not telling this because im a developer my self but because I have done many over sea projects for such a low cost with less time consumed.

As a project and marketing manager, it sounds like you just need to get your system set up with your specifications, with perhaps a little support if needed.  If youâ€™re unsure of what specific applications you may need, I might recommend finding and talking to a local expert just for your setup.  They can figure out exactly what you need and help you make your decision and make it happen.

Sounds like you need to find some local companies that you can outsource any work to that you are unable to provide yourself. I would suggest find some local people you can count on and figure a way to price your apps/consulting so it can work out for both of you.  I would be hesitant about online contractors and freelancing websites.  Find some people you can count on and can meet up with initially.  If needed in the future once you have a better handle on things you might be able to manage some remote developers, but that's a lot more complicated than it may seem.

You may start with Sales, Marketing and Design services. Mobile app development can be outsourced to software development companies. You can check them on [ODesk](https://www.odesk.com/)  or [Elance](https://www.elance.com/). I`d recommend to search for Eastern Europe companies (the most promising and reliable IT-outsourcing destination).
