I founded my startup a while back, (a year ago) built the first two versions myself. This summer i built a new version and about 50% of the way i brpught in a person to work with me. Then a month later another person.  

They have had significant contributions nut Im not sure they are co-founders.  What should their "titltes" be.

I normally wouldn't care, but we have to build a pitch deck and put a team slide.
