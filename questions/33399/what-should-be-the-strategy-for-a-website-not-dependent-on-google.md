If you are going after the social angle, I'd like to reiterate the answer I gave to another question on this site.  Being active in online communities is a great way to get the word out.  Find forums and groups consisting of people with interests in line with your product.  Build relationships and add value to the community, *then* you can talk about your site when relevant.  It is just one option I can offer.  If it is a high volume site/thread, like a digg or reddit, it can create significant traffic.  From there it is your job to retain the visitors.

First of all, I don't understand why you would want to attempt to create a web strategy without Google, but since you asked...


Consider an inbound marketing strategy that focuses on providing valuable content that will attract your target audience:

 1. **Create remarkable content**: This means creating content (using a WordPress blog) that your target audience will find compelling enough that they will want to share it with their peers. This could be because it's informative, inspirational, entertaining, etc...
 2. **Optimize for search**: Normally, this would be the second step. I know you've stipulated that you're looking for strategies that don't rely on search engines, but I still don't see a reason not to optimize for search. The one area of SEO you could skip would be link-building and it would save you some time and resources.
 3. **Promote via social media**: Create syndicate your content on social media channels like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube (product demonstrations), LinkedIn, etc... Since you don't want to depend on search engines, this will be your main source of traffic and critical to your success. You'll need to build a highly engaged, quality audience and keep your stream filled with great content. Over time, you should build up a large, opt-in email list and this would become your primary source of leads.
 4. **Convert visitors to leads**: Make sure you have strong calls to action on your website that direct users to landing pages. Calls to action include things like "purchase now," "download the demo," or "sign up for newsletter."
 5. **Measure**: Make sure you have analytics installed on your website so that you can measure where your traffic is coming from and (most importantly) what your conversion rates are on those landing pages.

All of the above answers are good, however it doesn't matter how good your content is or anything else you do in your site... you still need to generate the traffic and Google is one of the best ways to do that, via search and adwords. 

You don't have to "depend" on Google, just use its services and reach to drive traffic to your site. If you really don't want to deal with Google (they will still crawl your site eventually), you can try Facebook ads, or any other type of ads along with a social media campaign to drive traffic to your site.

In the end, the majority of internet users still uses Google search to find anything on the web, why not take advantage of that?

Good luck!

I have a number of blogs that I did not even bother to optimize for SEO. I simply signed up for the blog, wrote whatever came to mind about the niche I was interested in. I then did things on that blog that can penalize any website from an SEO standpoint--
<ul>
<li>plagriarism</li>
<li>not using tags in the copy</li>
<li>poor anchor text for my links</li>
<li>Senseless rants (eg, documentation for troubleshooting)</li>
<li>...etc</li>
</ul>
The subject that I was writing about was technical stuff--programming, computer repair and troubleshooting, and all that. Now and then, I'd find myself with a question or problem that I can't figure out by myself and I have to use google to look for answers. 

Surprisingly, I would find my non-SEO-optimized-blog in the search results every now and then. I guess the particular niche I was writing about did not have a lot of other blogs/websites about that topic.

Even if you wanted nothing to do with search engines, they are still going to find your website. But there's a way around it.

I'm not sure how you do this with other blogs, but with blogspot, when you go into settings, there's a check box option where you can tell blogspot not to let search engines crawl your blog. I haven't tried it, but I think that is one way for your blogger website to not be crawled by search engines.

I recommend focusing on the upcoming strengths of mobile search. In other words, learn and prepare for the next wave so that you will be positioned at the forefront. In doing so, your work will filter and benefit at other search levels and yet your time and ideas will be forward-focused. 

Mobile search is smart (when I say mobile I'm referring to smart phones). If, for example, I go to Las Vegas this coming New Year's, with mobile I can find places to eat based on where I am (since my phone knows), or based on specials for meals or, based on what my phone knows to be my favorite music. If it's my 6th trip to Las Vegas, my phone knows that too and will recommend places complementary to previous visits/interests, such as comedians, or in the geographic area of previous visits. There are white papers on the web and Standard & Poor's recently wrote up an interesting international mobile recommendation. 

By studying, planning, and implementing mobile search, you will continue to optimize for Google/Safari/Chrome/Bing/etc. even though you're relegating them to the background of your thoughts. At this time, mobile search is not strong in many companies and, as such, your organization should be able to move toward the top with a reasonable effort. There are strong indications that people are attempting to search with their mobile device and that it's the results that are disappointing rather than the technology available. 

Mobile search is a slightly different mindset: local, personalized, and more "intimate" than general search. Think of yourself as a guide in the phone, welcoming the user. People are, as you know, more intimate with their mobile device-it's a one-on-one technology. Your "voice" then, with SEO and content for mobile search, is **you** talking to **me** rather than your company talking to users. 

Learning about mobile search is fun, it will continue to boost your juice with existing search, and you'll be an early adopter able to get traction.

You are looking for a diversified marketing strategy.  I'll assume you have a great product. If not, build a great product first.   

Google/SEO is one way to market your product or service, but there are several others.  The tips below all center around becoming a leader in your space.

**1. Twitter**
Use twitter to (1) become a thought leader in your space and (2) directly engage your users.  Become a thought leader by pushing out relevant content in your industry, engaging in conversations with current thought leaders and RTing them, and writing your own original content that you also tweet out.  

**2. Forums**
Participate in forums that are relevant to your industry and provide value.  Over time, people will look to you as a leader in the space and treat your word as gold.  Don't overly promote your service, just focus on providing value.

**3. Write amazing content**
If you have successfully become a thought leader and provided value on forums, you can then write content which people will share, because they think of you as a leader in the space.  Focus on quality of content, not quantity.  

**4. Use following that others have built**
Start guest blogging with the amazing content that you have written. This way you can leverage the following that others have built to your advantage.  And they benefit from having a upcoming leader in the space writing for them.

**5. YouTube!**
YouTube is the 2nd largest search engine (I think?) and if you create great video content that provides value, people will find you and you will continue to build your following.
