<p>I am currently working on a startup (<a href="http://qrlot.com" rel="nofollow">QRlot</a>) which is a platform for launching QR code-enabled Virtual stores. 
I am doing a research on why this new marketing channel and mobile commerce initiative have not picked up yet in the US. 
I would appreciate your thoughts on this, I wrote the questions in more detail at my <a href="http://erkan.me/post/68263517139/why-the-qr-code-enabled-virtual-store-concept-is-not" rel="nofollow">personal blog</a>.</p>

<p>It hasn't taken off in the U.S. because:</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to download an app just to scan a QR code. It is not native to my Galaxy S4, or any other smart phone I have owned.</li>
<li>It's a huge security risk- scan a QR code and you get transported to a web site that can infect your phone with a trojan or virus. This has already happened- with people printing their own QR codes on stickers any placing that sticker over the real QR code on an ad.</li>
<li>I'm busily traveling from one place to another. I can read an ad and think about it. But what does the QR code do for me? To get any value from it I must stop in a public place, take out my phone, fumble around and scan the code. I will more than likely be blocking traffic.</li>
<li>What value does the QR code bring to me? If I get a discount now, that discount will be available at any time. If I don't get a discount, why bother.</li>
</ol>
