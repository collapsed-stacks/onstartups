<p>I view competition in china in the social network through the hourglass of how it will improve human rights.  I know pretty specific but I still recall the violent reaction in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and how China recently reacted to this year’s rewarding of the Nobel Peace Prize.  So I don’t see these type of sites in terms of profitability but in terms of social impact.</p>

<p>I was unrelated looking to some analytics around web usage and what firms are big in China.</p>

<p>So more related is the population of internet users:</p>

<p>So what are the top sites that are being used in China via alexa.<br>

Most people outside of China have very little interest or knowledge about internet companies and their practices within China.

This is due to the lack of media coverage, the difficulty for foreign internet / web companies to participate in the Chinese market and Western-centric view of the internet.

What is detailed in the link you provided may be seen as unfair outside of China, but may be viewed as reasonable inside China so it's hard to comment from that perspective without having any prior knowledge of the case.

As there is very little opportunity for foreign companies to participate in the Chinese web space it is not worthwhile for us to know. If it doesn't affect us, we don't really care.
