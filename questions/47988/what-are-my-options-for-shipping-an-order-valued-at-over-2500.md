We normally ship through the USPS

We just got an order for over $2500 and got this alert:

An Electronic Information (EEI) form must be filed for each international shipment valued over $2500.

That requires registration and taking a test at aesdirect.gov

I doubt we'll get another order requiring this anytime soon.  Is there an alternative such as using UPS or Fedex?

Its not a USPS form, its the US government export form, so you'll have to fill it regardless of carrier.
