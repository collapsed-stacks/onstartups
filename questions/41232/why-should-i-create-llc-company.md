Putting it simply...

Let's assume I'm your customer and your application caused me damage due to some negligence on your part (software design, lack of legal agreement to cover an option like that). I lose $500K - or at least claim I did.

If you're an LLC - I can only sue the company, **not you personally**. If I succeed in court, your company will have to pay me. If it can't, it may have to go bankrupt and shut down. In that case you'll still be able to start over with a new business free and clear of the previous business excused debt...

If you're not an LLC -- my flesh eating lawyers are **coming after you personally** -- if you lose in court - you and your family may **lose your house** and/or **forced into bankruptcy** if you can't pay up. Not something you want bring home...

LLC Protects you from business horror becoming family/personal horror.

Do yo know what a Corporation is? LLC provides the same beneft  
As Ron mentioned, LLC provides a huge Liability benefit. Any legal action must be taken against the company, not you personally. Depending on the state the LLC is registered in, that's great protection. I would suggest for a website to register in Nevada, as they provide amazing legal framework, you can then register in your home state as a foreign entity. It costs an additional couple hundred a year, but that's what you'd spend on 1 hour for "decent" lawyer.  
Additionally, it separates the company's debt from your own. Ever hear that a lot of small business owners have horrible credit? This is due to them charging company expenses on their own credit cards. If you have say $100k in personal credit limits. A small to mid sized company can have those expenses in one month, and it'll look like your cards are constantly maxed. If you don't succeed and go bankrupt, that debt gets discharged in business bankruptcy, not gets transferred to you unless you personally guarantee it.  
Another benefit is if you decide to sell, it is much easier to sell the whole company than just 1 site. Additionally, it makes you look much more professional, and shows people this is a business not a "hobby" site.  
You also get a variety of tax benefits, although you get those with sole proprietorship as well, it is easier to separate and record when you are fully registered.  
You are also afforded better protections in terms of Intellectual Property, although in this regard I suggest speaking to an attorney, because this topic is too big for a Q&A site

The principal benefit is that the liabilities of the company stop with the company, and you can't be pursued personally for its debts (unless you act recklessly, negligently or illegally, in which case the corporate shield may be broken).
