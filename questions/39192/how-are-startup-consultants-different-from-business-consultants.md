In the general sense, I'm wonder how [startup consultants][1] might be different from [business consultants][2]?

Some thoughts that immediately come to mind:

**Startup Consultants** focus on:

 - Founding considerations (incorporation, bylaws, early contracts, founder equity split, intellectual property allocation)

 - Investment considerations (pitching to VCs, ownership allocation after investment)

 - Establishing a development model for products/services after some testing. Not much hierarchy in place, so there's room to discover an optimal way of organizing work.



**Business & Management Consultants** focus on:

 - Cost-effectiveness and profitability of product/services provided

 - Working with established depts. and improving on existing methods of business organization. Adaptation to existing/legacy systems is involved. Even the wikipedia article you posted says: "...primarily through the analysis of **existing organisational problems** and development of plans for improvement"
