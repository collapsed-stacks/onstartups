<p>I have an app that gives info and trivia facts about globally recognised brands, sports teams etc. </p>

<p>If I want to use photos or logos that belong to these brands, can I use a disclaimer notice that very clearly states that the IP belongs to Brand X and that I do not hold or claim to hold copyright of any of the images etc used?</p>
