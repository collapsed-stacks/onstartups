Always, wondered this, and never found a good answer. Guess the opposite applies, too -- how do you know someone does NOT have the right to enter a legal agreement on behalf of a company?

**Please cite sources: US Federal Law and/or Case Law**

Thanks!

<p>You don't know, though sometimes you can do research to gain comfort.</p>

<p>In practical terms, one relies on:</p>

<ul>
<li>The signing individual's representation that s/he has authority to bind the company. If that representation proves to be false, you can go after him / her personally.</li>
<li>The fact that, under certain circumstances, an individual with apparent authority can bind a company, even if s/he did not have actual authority. Please see "<a href="http://dana.sh/9tfRFT" rel="nofollow">Who Can Sign a Contract for a Corporation?</a>"</li>
</ul>
