I'm developing a product for creating software installers. Initially this was a hobby project; just prove to myself that I can acheive my technical goals writing this product. The product is available for free and I know there are several users because they are asking questions on my forum and through e-mail. The product has been downloaded about 1k times. It is now reaching its third version.

But I'm thinking of commercializing my product. The question is whether it will be profitable. I do have my local idea for profitability. I also have some statistics of downloads, site usage, number of questions from users, etc. How do I make my attempt at rough estimate of possible income if I charge for my product.

A bit more info that can be useful: platform is Windows/.NET/Visual Studio (excluding Express). Therefore most likely users of my product have some money. And if they do not (because they got their Windows/Visual Studio from MSDNAA/BizSpark) I can still give it away for free/at reduced price (possibly with some license restrictions).

So the bottom line is: how do I estimate my income?

As I understand your question, you have built a software installer for the desktop market and want to know how profitable it will be. Is that correct?

I have **very bad** news for you. You want to enter a **very crowded niche market**, with yet another installer. There are not many people/companies that need your product. There are **lots** of great products already out there that do what your product will do. **And there are free products, like Inno Setup, that you have to compete with**. 

Let's assume you come up with a product that is **better** than everything else that is out there already. In that case your income is going to be limited by your ability to **market** your software **and** the fact that people have to invest signifigant time converting from what they are usingnow to your product.

Now assume that your product is **at best equal to what's already out there**. No matter how much you market, few people are going to invest the time and effort converting to your product when it is no better than what they are already using. And if they are using a free installer, they are not going to be willing to fork over money to you and convert, if you are just the same as what they are already using for free.

I don't think I have to analyze what happens if your product isn't as good as the existing ones.

<p><strong>Congratulation</strong>! I have a hard life with the existing offer. I'll be more than happy to try what you have to propose.</p>

<p>To start, I suggest you the following book. I think it's the best book ever written on the subject of pricing and income estimation.</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0136106811" rel="nofollow">Strategy and Tactics of Pricing</a></p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YFq8l.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>You will figure out what to do. Good luck with your product, and please tell us what your product is, I really need it myself.</p>
