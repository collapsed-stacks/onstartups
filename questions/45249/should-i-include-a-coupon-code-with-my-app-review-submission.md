I will be submitting my Android app to bloggers and review sites very soon. My app has two editions: a 30-day free "trial" version, and a paid "pro" version. I've created coupon codes that unlock the 30-day trial, essentially turning it into the pro version. (I cannot give them free coupons for the pro version as Google doesn't allow it).

My question is, should I include these coupon codes when I submit the app to bloggers, or let them ask for one? To me it seems a no-brainer to include a coupon, but my PR consultant says to wait until they reply, in order to build a relationship.

I believe building an relationship is important, but I also believe the majority of bloggers are too busy to ask for one, and so my app won't get as many reviews. They may still review the 30-day trial, but I think there is a good chance they will like my app enough to actually want to use it personally, so I don't want to make it as easy as possible. IMO that is an even better way to build a relationship.

**Bottom line: send a coupon code or not?**


Thanks in advance...

Do not send the coupon code. You wont necessarily built rapport by having them ask you for a coupon code but you are basically wasting coupon codes. This is what I suggest.

If your 30-day trial version does not limit a blogger from checking out every feature your application has to offer, then you dont even need to give them coupon code. However, you are willing to give them a fully unlocked version as a good gesture (a holiday gift ;)).

One thing I would like to suggest is that you make take special note of which bloggers host competitions and ask them if they want 5 or so coupon codes to give away to their readers. This will actually get you more bites from bloggers and you will essentially be giving away coupon codes that you would've given away to uninterested blogger anyway!

EDIT: One more reason to not give away coupon codes is because some bloggers view it as bribery. It seems odd to me too, but this comes straight from the horses mouth! I've asked a community of game journalists (who receive such codes on daily bases, I was one of them!) and they say most indie developers blatently send them codes because they feel like THEY have to appeal to the journalist. Usually it's the other way around. Journalists usually, in the video game field, have to message publishers for codes. 

Be confident in your creation. They have 30 days to email you and ask you for a code. Think about it, don't you appreciate it way more when your family members give you something you asked for instead of you being offered a present which you might not even want?
