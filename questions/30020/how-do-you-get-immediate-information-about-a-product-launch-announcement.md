Well, I use an RSS reader (most email clients like TrulyMail and Thunderbird include RSS readers) and subscribe to the major press release sources like PRNewswire: http://www.prnewswire.com/rss/

If you know the specific industry you would like to monitor for product launches, I would suggest using google alerts.
Just configure the relevant search term, and you will receive any news updates on that directly to your email.

Also you can try to create a saved search on twitter, and follow that for any interesting data.
