Well, I guess that same story goes around for some time - I have a pretty good software and have some market for it, but I guess that it could find its use in various targeted niches.  It has to do something with video.

So, I would like to post my ad on some site and try to find some selling partner for some niche for my software.  Someone that will help me move from program to product.

Do you know of any such site?

Daniel, your best bet is probably to get in touch with the local entrepreneurial community and meet someone who's a good match.  I'm dicey on using a web site to find such a person, as it doesn't give a good feel for whether you "click" or not.
