I am interesting in moving out to another city to work at a promising startup, particularly one with venture funding and user traction.

How do venture-backed startups generally handle candidates who are not local? Does this put me at a disadvantage? Would the company be willing to fly me out for an on-site interview?

Also, what consideration, if any, is given for relocation costs?

I am aware the answers to these questions will be different from company-to-company but would like to get a general idea of what to expect.

Also, just for background information, I am a recent college grad who is looking for a software engineering position.

It depends on whether or not they can find local candidates for the position (and how much money they raised).

For a junior programming position, if the startup is in silicon valley, it's not so likely that they would pay for relocation.

For a senior, experienced programmer, if the startup is in Anchorage, Alaska, they're going to be relocating a candidate, so they would probably pay for travel to the interview and relocation.

If they got seed funding of $250,000, it's less likely they will pay for travel. If they raised $100M, they probably will.

It's all based on supply and demand; there's no one answer.

Anyway... why are you asking us? Ask the company. They will tell you. Asking will not hurt your chances of getting a job.
