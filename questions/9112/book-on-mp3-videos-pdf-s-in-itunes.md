Does anyone know how to get books on MP3 or videos listed for sale in iTunes?  

How about PDF's of books for the iPad or iPhone?

<p>From what I can tell, it needs to be an actual app that delivers your content - ebooks as apps are one of the biggest categories at the App Store.</p>

<p>There are lots of companies that will package your content feeds and create the app in your name - That's what I did with one app for <a href="http://47hats.com" rel="nofollow">47hats</a>, the <a href="http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Startup Success Podcast</a> and the Twitter feed from my <a href="http://startuptodo.com" rel="nofollow">startup</a>. I went through <a href="http://Appmakr.com" rel="nofollow">Appmakr.com</a>. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/47hats/id351121898?mt=8" rel="nofollow">iTunes link</a></p>

<p>You can do a free, no ad app, an ad-supported app (splitting revenue) or a for sale app (but you need to be in the Apple iPhone Developer program for that - $100).</p>

<p>Also, read this <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/03/the-wordperfect-axiom.html" rel="nofollow">post</a> by Seth Godin, try out the app of one of his older books (search for Vook) and you'll see the potential this has.</p>
