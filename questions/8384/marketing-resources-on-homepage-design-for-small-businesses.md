Title says it all. Do you guys have some resources (slideshare, blogposts) on the marketing (+copywriting) part of homepage design to share?

"standalone" advice in this thread is appreciated too :)

Assorted tips:

- Shorter is better.
- Don't be afraid of whitespace.
- Every pixel counts; don't waste it on meaningless clip-art.
- The goal is to get them to click to the next page, not to tell your life story.
- A/B test to empirically determine correct messaging, layout, etc.
- Make sure I know what pain you're solving in 3 seconds.

+1 for Jason's suggestions. I'd add that I need to be able to answer these questions within a minute of landing on your web site:

1. Why is this page here? (What does it sell?, inform?, offer?, etc.)
2. Are you professional? (Is your page polished and clean?)
3. What do you want me to do? (Call to action.)

<p>Well, since you asked, I sell an ebook, <em>MicroISV Sites that Sell!</em> ($19 USD, sometimes on sale for less) has received a good number of positive mentions.  It's 90 pages on how to build, concept-by-concept, an effective, compelling web site for your small software business. </p>

<p>Here's a sample: <a href="http://bit.ly/6PRuff" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/6PRuff</a> and here's the book: <a href="http://bit.ly/okRSW" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/okRSW</a></p>

<p>Here's a few links to consider:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.clickz.com/838531" rel="nofollow">WIIFM</a> - a good article about defining your unique selling proposition. </p>

<p>Once you have that down, here's a good two part article on how to apply this to your homepage (the process the author uses to measure effectiveness is worth the read) </p>

<p>article: get visitors to read and remember your homepage</p>

OK, this REALLY depends on what you are trying to sell, or convey.

Are you doing e-commerce or just generating awareness?
Do you sell services or products?
Do you use 3 parties?
etc., etc., etc.

Ultimately, less is MORE on a website.  Also PLEASE make sure your contact info (phone, address, email,etc.) is one the landing page.  You cannot believe how FEW companies actually MISS the marketing 101 item!  Yes, even F100s!!

Other than that, Inc. has some pretty good ideas on what works and what does not.  

Good luck

I recommend that you spend some time on this SEO forum:

- http://www.highrankings.com/forum/

I have learned a LOT there which I have been able to put to good use for our web site, and I also came to "know" a number of experts who participate there and eventually was able to select some to help my company.
