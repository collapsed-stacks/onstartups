Don't really know if this is the best forum for market feedback - but I'll throw in my opinion here.  

While many would put importance on the "eco-friendly" aspects of a product - I think function and practicality within a target market is more important.

Example:  Solar chargers would seem to be a slam dunk for those of us who are gadget obsessed - but where are they practical?  If we're talking indoor applications, the value proposition isn't any better than plugging into an outlet. In outdoor applications, many of the ones I've encountered were either too heavy or too fragile for backpacking / camping applications.  The ones that were interesting hit another snag - their price/performance ratio (capacity, weight & dollars) could not compete against a dedicated secondary battery or hand crank.
