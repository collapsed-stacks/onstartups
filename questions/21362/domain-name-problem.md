I am searching for domain name over a week. But all options i have tried bought someone else. And those domain names are not active. They parked somewhere. I am almost out of options. In that case what do you suggest? Which way i should follow?

<p>Whenever I need to think of a new name for a project, I make an Excel list for it. As I think of names, I add them to the list, check to see if the domain is available using <a href="http://www.godaddy.com" rel="nofollow">GoDaddy</a>, check if someone else is ranking for that name in Gooogle, and then check to make sure I can get the usernames on social networks using <a href="http://www.namechk.com" rel="nofollow">NameChk</a>.</p>

<p>I then look at all my options, and I usually have something that is available and I'm happy with.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to finding a good domain name/business name:</p>

<ul>
<li>Combine two thoughts - (Applications + sumo wrestling match = <a href="http://www.appsumo.com" rel="nofollow">AppSumo</a>, Cool + Chat = <a href="http://www.hipchat.com" rel="nofollow">HipChat</a>)</li>
<li>Choose a mascot - This has worked for some webcompanise (<a href="http://www.hipmunk.com" rel="nofollow">HipMunk</a>, <a href="http://www.duckduckgo.com" rel="nofollow">DuckDuckGo</a>)</li>
<li>Just make something up that sounds cool or is witty (<a href="http://www.chartbeat.com" rel="nofollow">ChartBeat</a>, <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Wordpress</a>)</li>
<li>Change the spelling of a word (Google, Flickr)</li>
<li>if all else fails, you could try an add on domain (GetDropbox, GetHarvest, theFacebook)</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion - You are better off coming up with a fun and interesting name that has a story behind it and people will remember instead of choosing something descriptive and kind of boring.</p>

It is the same for most people. Finding good domain name that describes you business accurately is difficult task. I can only suggest you to try harder and to brain storm for new ideas. If you have enough money you can try to acquire some domain that is parked, but be prepared for some negotiations and high price.

<p>If you have at least 200 bucks you could start a naming project on <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/company-name/" rel="nofollow">crowdSPRING</a> to let their community help you find an awesome name with a free domain.</p>

<p>In my opinion it can be really worth it instead of paying for parked domains.</p>

Finding domains that are "dictionary" words but not obscured is next to impossible today. "deals.com" was up for grabs around 1994 or so... ;-) forget about 2011.

Instead, make up a word that's catchy or try combining words with short words like "In", "On" and such. (e.g. Groupon.com"). I made up "fooyaz.com" which was available for registration.

good luck.

A great way for finding an available domain name is by using the tools available on DomainHole. The site is in beta, but you can get in with code DOMAINS.

The expired domain search is fantastic - you put in a keyword and it will give back 2 word domains, that include your keyword.

The name spinner is also a great tool - gives you suggestions you never even thought of.
