I am looking for guidance on building models for subscriber growth to a B2C software app.  We have existing channels of distribution (partners) that refer business to us and we provide an offline service today with a cd-rom based deliverable.  We are moving to offering less offline service and are building a web app with a monthly subscription.  Interest and demand are present however we are trying to build our models and projections to determine how many subscribers we will have at X date, including many factors (i.e. acquisition cost, attrition, etc.)

I thought I remember seeing Sean Ellis talking about how to get"traction" with subscriber growth in a viral approach but cannot find the post.  Any input on how to project subscriber growth, attrition, refund rate, etc would be appreciated.  We do not expect to use a lot of marketing dollars on advertising but rather use existing channels to fuel growth.
Thanks,
@gesco

<p>I honestly believe you cannot predict the rate at which you'll grow.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/how-i-got-6000-rss-subscribers-in-12-months.html" rel="nofollow">my blog's RSS subscriber count</a>, for example, you'll see bumps and bends.  I didn't do <em>anything</em> differently at those times -- it happened on it own.</p>

<p>What you can do is model your revenue and expenses with a given number of subscribers and determine where you're breaking even and so forth.  But <em>when</em> you achieve a given number, it's too chaotic to know.</p>
