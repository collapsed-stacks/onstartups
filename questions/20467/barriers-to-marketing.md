I just started a daily deals website company that deals in the alternative/holistic healing industry and the medical cannabis industry. 

Since we have started with the medical cannabis side of things, we have found it extremely difficult to do local marketing effectively and have found little resources to help us along this journey. 

What are some suggestions in finding out how to effectively attain this type of audience?

There are two constituencies that you have to focus sales/marketing on in a dailydeals business: customers and suppliers.

You are probably aware of which dailydeals sites have a local presence (groupon, livingsocial, and if you are international do a quick scan of http://www.alldailyoffers.com/). Try to network to local sales / marketing guys to learn best practices on addressing both customers and suppliers. 

Zippy has a great tip on how to network here: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/20025/how-to-get-introductions-to-investors/20512#20512 

In the meantime on customer side, start with an email list of people you know and create a referral bonus to grow your database of users.

Both Facebook PPC ads and Google AdWords offer good options for geo-targeting. Target searches that contain the city name + relevant keywords, or interest-target on Facebook and then narrow to the city. 

Flyering at local festivals could work well, also.

If you're starting this business, I assume you know a lot about the subject. You should start a blog to share all your knowledge with your clients, and then that will turn into paying customers. 

Read Inbound Marketing by Dharmesh Shah for more information on how to get started.
