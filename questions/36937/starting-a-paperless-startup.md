We are looking into best-practices to make our startup paperless from the get go. We are using dropbox of course, but what kind of tools would you recommend to scan, archive and share documents, which come in on paper?

I've been exceptionally happy with the Fujitsu ScanSnap scanner coupled with the DevonThink Pro database. Scanning is easy. Searching is easy. The documents are saved as PDFs that have the original image along with the OCR'd text.

I too like the ScanSnap scanner and have it scan to Evernote and Dropbox [for redundancy].  Of course, stopping the info from becoming paper in the first place is key.  Our company, Zumbox, has a service that does for mail by making it Digital Postal Mail.  Getting your bills sent this way and saved for free, forever is key.

<p>There are a number of document management systems available <a href="http://www.alfresco.com/" rel="nofollow">Alfresco</a> has an open source version and <a href="http://box.com/" rel="nofollow">Box</a> has a SaaS offering. I think you'll have some additional work to do get scanning of paper documents working with either, but there are add on products available for both.</p>
