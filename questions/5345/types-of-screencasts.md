<p>Marwa, can you clarify what you mean by the three definitions please?</p>

<p>1) On-screen screencasts - I'd call these 'true screencasts' if they record the computer screen and use a voice-over to tell you what's happening.  The term was coined by Jon Udell in 2004: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast</a> and they're the kind of video that I make.  Think of the Ruby on Rails 15 minute weblog video and all the videos you'll find in a site like ShowMeDo.</p>

<p>2) Paper cut-offs - I'm guessing you mean hand-drawn animations of the sort created by <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.commoncraft.com/</a> ?  They aren't screencasts (according to the original definition) because you're not recording the screen but instead using a video camera.  They are commonly used to demonstrate software.</p>

<p>3) Spaghetti screencasts - I'm afraid I don't know what this refers to - can you clarify?</p>

<p>Other techniques I've used in screencasts include the combination of: pure screencast, video recording (e.g. a person in the street being interviewed), screencast with embedded web-cam, PowerPoint slides and animations.  I refer to these as hybrid videos.</p>

<p>Another hybrid approach might be to create animations of software using a tool like Flash or Blender and then add a voice-over - I'd call these animations rather than screencasts but the line is rather blurry...</p>
