I and a couple of friends from PandaForm (blog.pandaform.com) is doing a web startup in Hong Kong. We're quite lonely there in Hong Kong as the ecosystem of web-startup is not even there yet. Anyway I will be traveling to LA / SF / MV on 15 - 19 Mar and NY on 8 - 14 Mar, so I hope there is a chance we can meet and talk with others...

Would you suggest any meet-up for us, or would anyone of you around the area interested to meet?

Thanks a lot and I can be contacted at: bencheng@oursky.com.

Best,
Ben
Founder, Oursky.com / PandaForm.com

Ben, , for SF, check out http://sfnewtech.com/. They have an event on March 17th. For others, check out meetup.com and search for startup and other tech events at same time. You can also try http://www.svase.org/.
