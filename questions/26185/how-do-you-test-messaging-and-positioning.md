I know this varies as to who your audience is. But for those targeting enterprises and for those targeting consumers (online applications) how do you test your messaging? Focus groups, A/B testing, usertesting.com, advertising tests, champion groups...how do you make sure your key messages are resonating with your target audience?

Thanks!

A/B testing using Google Optimizer. We have done this with great results. Focus groups have been slanted and way off in a few cases.

We continue doing this, tweaking one thing at a time to increase conversions and goals.
