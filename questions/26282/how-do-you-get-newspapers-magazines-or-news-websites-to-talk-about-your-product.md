So many web 2.0 type sites these days have a "As Seen In" or "Featured In" section on their website. Does anyone know what the best approach to achieving this kind of PR is?

One way is to subscribe to "Help a Reporter Out".

You will get an email list of requests by media people for specific topics - a California short sale real estate expert, or mothers of twins, or people who drive hybrid cars. When there's a request that fits your business or product, like a request for time-saving business software suggestions, you can respond, and there's a chance the reporter may feature you in their story.

When you distribute press releases they can be picked up by media and sites like that.
