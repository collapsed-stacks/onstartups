## How to Start-Up and Internet marketing company?

We would like to start up an “Internet Marketing Company” to market our own product range.  We have minimal experience in online marketing.  We are not sure even where to begin with this. 
What would be the best way to establish what expertise we would need regarding staff we would need to hire and skills they would be required to have? Should we seek advice from online marketing companies? 

Or are there consultants who specialize in helping to set up an online marketing business?

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Thanks

John

***NOTE --- Just to clarify.  We have previously hired companies to market our products. The problem is that we have 30 websites for them to market so it costs a fortune. eg: Our optimization company wants to charge us $2,000/website (60k/month) which is too much. So we figure if we hired our own in-house team the cost would be significantly less.  We are not actually looking at becoming an Internet Marketing Company to market for others. It is purely to market our own products and to make it more cost effective to do so.  ***

<p>I do not understand the logic in starting an internet marketing company when you are not experienced in internet marketing. It will take a lot of effort to become experienced enough to sale these types of services.  If you just need help marketing your own products hire an internet marketing consultant to get you started or check some the resources below. </p>

I work for an internet/social media marketing agency. We offer an array of online services, but if you are just interested in SEO for your websites, we could help with that too. What type of budget are you comfortable with? Let me know and I'll check internally to see if we can do it for you.
