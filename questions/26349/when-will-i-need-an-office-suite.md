Ok this is directed to all eCommerce owners (or anyone in the online business world). Do you actually use office suites like Word or Google docs? I really cant think Of a situation Were I would need it for my Saas (still an idea) start-up. Could you guys kindly share and give me advice on when I would need such software. Esp if I have stuff like quickbooks for eg meaning there wont be a need for excel right?

You are the expert on your own needs and practices, but I find an office suite useful for dealing with complex documents. Your attorney may, for one example, send you some docs for comment.

If you were to choose the OpenOffice suite you would have a powerful tool for the price of a download and a bit of orientation.
