Our startup has been selected to go to Seedcamp Paris next week. We are very excited and flattered. It's the first time all the founders get to participate in such an event. Any recommendation on how to make the most of it?

Wow! First of all i would like to say congrats and would hope that you guys become successful! In my opinion i would make the most connections in the small amount of time that they would be giving you since that's what really counts! This would open you to more opportunities and learning which is also really important.

Just be open and straight up straight forward with people as well as sincere and Im sure you are gonna have a great time :)

Do you have any ideas for your startup? I would love to see how you guys develop your startup since we are bootstrapping ours.
