## How could I obtain a very focused IT vendor list?

I would like to obtain (compile myself or buy) a list of vendors of software development libraries and SDKs. 

In other words I would like to get a list just of vendors of just this one particular type of software tool. Just library and SDK and API vendors. 

I *may* care about platform in the future, but right now I do not have a need to be that restrictive. Given a list of such vendors I could do that type of restrictive narrowing down myself. 

The traditional list brokers like InfoUSA do not appear to be granular enough with their searches or their data. The most restrictive search you can perform there by type of product is by SIC code. For this purpose that is not good enough because you still wind up with thousands of vendors that sell every kind of end user software. 

Any thoughts other than using a site like Dmoz and crawling through all of the dead links?

Bump for October. Still interested in a solution here.

What you gotta do is ripp off the list from sites like component source, strike iron, programabble web etc.

Next i would start looking at Repositories on Github. 
Write a spider that searches for the keyword SDK and parse the links for what seems to work for you.
