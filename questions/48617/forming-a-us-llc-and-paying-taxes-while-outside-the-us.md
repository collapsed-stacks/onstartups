I am currently a resident alien in Virginia. I have been in the US since November 2011 (never left) and I have a J-1 visa, which expires on February 2014. I am going to leave US and go back to my home country (Turkey) before the end of this year. I also don't have any US-income as I am sponsored by my home country, however, I do have an SSN.

We are planning to form a US based LLC with a friend, who is a Turkish citizen but resides in Russia. This is a software company, and our income will be through Apple App Store sales, and maybe some individual app sales through PayPal.

Both of us will be members of the LLC, on a 50% basis. I understand that by default, LLC is a pass-through entity with respect to taxes, and each member pay taxes on their share of the profits on their personal income tax returns. That wouldn't be a problem if both of us were in the US. However, the situation is complicated. I also have limited information about ITIN, EIN, etc. I also would like to state that we will definitely hire a third-party registered agent.

What would be the best scenario for forming the LLC in our case? I have the following questions:

> Scenario One: Form the company in Virginia
> -----

>  - As I am currently a resident in Virginia, should we form the company in Virginia?
 - Since I have SSN, I think I will be able to obtain EIN for the LLC and also open a business bank account. Would my partner needs to do anything, i.e. apply for an ITIN?
 - How would we pay taxes? As I've stated before, I will be back in my home country by the end of this year and will no longer be a resident in the US. Will I be able to pay income taxes from my share while I am outside the US? Would my SSN expire? Will I need to get an ITIN? What about my partner, how will he pay taxes?
 - Can we renew the LLC in Virginia and continue our business after I leave? Do we need to follow any other procedures?



> Scenario Two: Form the company in Delaware
> -----
>  - I hear that Delaware has several advantages, especially for companies whose members are outside the US. However, since I am currently in Virginia, can we start the business in Delaware? Would it be a better choice?
 - Same questions about taxes, EIN, SSN, ITIN apply here, as well.
 - Also same questions about what should we do after I go back.


It is unclear to me if it is beneficial to start the company while I am in the US, or if it is better to start it when I get back. I also would like to know about registered agents, because they have different and much more expensive plans for forming LLCs from outside the US. What difference does it make? If I start the company right now, would we need to switch to another registered agent or another plan?

I am sorry if my post is confusing, but I am really confused on what to do. I would appreciate any help. Thank you.

You are **not** "resident alien". You're on J1 visa, and as such you're not considered resident for any purpose (neither immigration nor taxes).

> I do have an SSN

Irrelevant piece of information. Having SSN doesn't give you any rights whatsoever. Its just a number.

That is correct.

> That wouldn't be a problem if both of us were in the US.

How does it matter where you are? Tax-wise you're non-residents, both of you.

Your questions:

> As I am currently a resident in Virginia, should we form the company
> in Virginia?

Since you're not planning to stay in the US - it doesn't matter where you are now. Open it in the most convenient (=cheapest and least troublesome) state.

> Since I have SSN, I think I will be able to obtain EIN for the LLC and
> also open a business bank account.

You don't need SSN to get EIN. Any TIN will do. But in your case, since you have SSN, that is your TIN.

>Would my partner needs to do anything, i.e. apply for an ITIN?

Yes. Your partner will need ITIN, you won't since you have SSN which is a TIN. You both will have to file US tax returns.

You'll also have to file a partnership tax return (form 1065) for the LLC itself

> Can we renew the LLC in Virginia and continue our business after I
> leave? Do we need to follow any other procedures?

You can renew. Check the State laws about other procedures.

> I hear that Delaware has several advantages, especially for companies
> whose members are outside the US.

Not really relevant to you, these are advantages for companies looking for investors/public companies.

Other questions are location agnostic, DE or VA, the answers are the same.

Corporation formation is just one of the hurdles you'll have to overcome (and I think littleadv covered that pretty well already).  You might have banking issues as well.  You'll need a bank account in the state of Virginia/DE if that's where you form your LLC and it's very likely that you'll need to be present to open it.  The fact that your an out-of-country citizen *could* be an issue for a business account.  It's worth looking into sooner rather than later.  

There is also the issue of paying foreign-owned entities through paypal and the apple store.  Look deeply into their rules and regulations - specifically about internationally owned businesses.  There is the potential of them permanently withholding payment if you are in violation of one of their rules.
