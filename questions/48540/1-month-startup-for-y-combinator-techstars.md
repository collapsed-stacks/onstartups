I am a software developer working full time in USA and my half paycheck is going to my startup that I just started this April 2013 (off shored to India - my home country). I am the Founder/CEO of this company so far...

Now my question is that should I apply for startup incubators like Y-Combinator/Techstars now or after going live? The deadline for this startup is this August so we are going intense right now (Nights + Weekends).

Also, moving forward should I book my company's Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. pages right now?
