We don't have any natural english speakers with our company, so what is a good site to have our blog posts, etc. proofread for style, grammar, etc?
Any comments and thoughts on the subject are appreciated.

In the past, I have used http://www.theproofreaders.com to proof our copy and the results have been acceptable.

<p>The first thing I would ask is who will be reading your blogs? What country are they from? What level of education do they have? You want to write your material to your audience. </p>

<p>For example, if you are targeting scientists, I would consider <a href="http://www.biosciencewriters.com/" rel="nofollow">BioScience Writers</a>. Perhaps its Academic, try <a href="http://paperproofreader.com/" rel="nofollow">Paper Proof Reader</a>. Otherwise I have heard these people are good for a general audience <a href="http://www.megoodengrish.com" rel="nofollow">Me Good Engrish</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.paperrater.com/" rel="nofollow">PaperRater.com</a>.</strong>  Highly recommend, have tested essays with this site, and does the job well and free!  All online and no downloads...</p>

Not necessarily proofreading, but a spell checking (which is a part of proofreading) site: http://www.spellr.us/

I'm going on vacation until May 25th. But I'd be happy to help proofread your site for you as I'm sure others would be as well.  I think it's a bit silly to pay people/services that much to proof read unless it is a lot of paper work like 100+ pages or non-standard or legal documents.

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://peopleperhour.com" rel="nofollow">Peopleperhour</a>. Its is a very large community of free-lancers and at last count they had 2,069 freelance professionals who do proofreading. You have to pay them but the quality should be a lot more consistent than what you could get for free.</p>
