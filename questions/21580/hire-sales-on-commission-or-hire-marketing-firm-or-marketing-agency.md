I started a data management consulting and accounting firm, while business are having traction, at this point I have more business than I can handle myself, so I hired a part-time employee to help out along with outside contractors from time to time.  I decided to really grow the business so I can have more employees, especially to keep the part-time that I currently have because she expressed to me that she would want to work full-time.  

I have been doing my own marketing, mainly online marketing and blogging to attrack customers and it is working ok.  Since I do not have much marketing budget nor time, I don't want to loss on high costs marketing strategy that gives no results.  I want a more aggressive growth plan with a tight budget. I am wondering if I should hire a marketing firm, an advertising agency or hire a sales on commission.   What are the price level am I looking at if I hire a marketing firm or advertising agency to do the job.  

Thanks
Cecilia

If you're willing to hire, I find always best to keep marketing in-house. Generally, you know what marketing you need so I tend to go for intelligent graduates in subjects that aren't great for getting them a job. The non-science and engineering grads tend to be very grateful for the chance and (sorry geeks) better at personal interactions required for marketing and sales.

Basically, someone intelligent that you can mould. External firms never care enough to do it right.

If your business is not limited to a certain geographical location, you might want to consider outsourcing. You can head over to oDesk and find hardworking talent in sales and marketing.
