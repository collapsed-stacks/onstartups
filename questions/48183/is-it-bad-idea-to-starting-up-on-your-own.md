(actually the title may be misleading, but couldn't find better one)

I am planning for a start-up soon. I prefer to start it up all alone, but i have heard people saying start-up is a too-much an effort for a single person. I agree with that, but i just want to skip those issue between co-founders. Because Its something like my dream being an entrepreneur, so want no compromise on it, thus might not  bear lagging efforts of other co-founders. (basically my friends). Though, as an alternative i think of hiring good people who are happy with stack options. Any advice on this?

Conventional wisdom is that you need more that one founder, but this is not true for every case and there are startups with just one person.

Being an entrepreneur can be a lonely journey, especially if you are alone, but it is ultimately a rewarding thing, if you are that kind of person.

It is slightly worrying when you say you "...want no compromise...", as business is often about compromise, given limited resources.

In any case, I'd say, it is possible to startup on your own, but I'd advice joining some group of like-minded people (local tech-scene, etc), so that you have someone to bounce ideas off of.
