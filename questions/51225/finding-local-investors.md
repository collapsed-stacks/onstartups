<p>I am planning to start a web service. I really don't understand business stuff, for that reason I need to hire a marketing and another business person. I live in Brisbane, Australia and wanting to know where can I find an investor who could simply fund me well enough so that I could hire what I need?</p>

<p>Business and seducing investors is really not that complicated. You must have a credible story as to how your company will make them rich(er). I suggest, rather than trying to hire marketing and business people, you figure out a lot more of your business by yourself.</p>

<p>Who will your customer be? Who pays for your product? How do they find out about it? How much profit do you make on each sale?</p>

<p>If you are shooting for a free site and don't have immediate plans for monetization, the questions would look more like: why would your site grow exponentially, is there something special about your users that make them attractive targets for advertising? Etc. You can figure this out by yourself, there are so many resources online to cover every angle.</p>
