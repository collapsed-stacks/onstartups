I was thinking of including the word "business" in a slogan for a new service but I was wrestling whether or not this is really necessary. I say business because that's the target market I'd like to go after.

My question is, is this really necessary? The more I think about this, the more I see more application that non-business types can use... and I feel like I might be deterring that traffic if I target everything towards business. 

So, to reiterate, should I 

A) include a reference in the slogan that I'm targeting businesses, 

or

B) just pick a slogan, it doesn't need to imply anything about businesses. I should gear my marketing towards businesses...

I'm probably overthinking this. Thanks.

A good slogan will explain **what you do for a market** not just point to what market you are in.

A good slogan is only part of your overall brand and identity. It should convey, in a word, phrase or short sentence what you do. Adding a market to that might limit your reach. Just look at some of the more famous slogans:

 - Nike: Just Do It
 - HP: Invent
 - Apple: Think Different
 - GE: We bring good things to life
 - FedEx: Absolutely, positively overnight
 - Travelocity: You will never roam alone
 - Google: Don't be Evil

In all of these cases, there is really no mention of a specific market or type other than maybe FedEx or Travelocity but those are still more general for what they do.

If you really want a good slogan, then boil it down to your core value. If you got 5 seconds to pitch me why I should pay attention to your company, what would you say? Write down a 10 or so of these simple phrases and your slogan will be among them.

I think you overestimate the impact of your slogan to the market. For you, the slogan is very special and important; for your customers, it's just another slogan like the thousands of slogans they hear or read every day.

<p>Do your competitors include the word "business" in their slogan? Your slogan should define your company as it relates to your competitors. If offering your product <em>for businesses</em> is a differentiating factor (i.e. the competition offers a similar product but they target consumers), then I say you should use the word. However, if offering your product <em>for businesses</em> doesn't clearly differentiate you from the competition, I would suggest keeping your target audience in mind (business owners) but not include the said word as it doesn't really help <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning%5F%28marketing%29" rel="nofollow">positioning</a> your company.</p>

Your mission matters.  If you don't know what your mission is, you don't know what you're doing.

You're not really asking about your slogan.  The question you're asking is a very, very important one for your business: are you creating a product for businesses or for consumers, or both?  The answer to that question will have a profound effect on the product, your marketing, and your priorities.

Don't worry about your slogan.  But be very clear on your mission.

I completely agree with Jarie, the easier and the shorter the slogan, the better it is understood and remembered
