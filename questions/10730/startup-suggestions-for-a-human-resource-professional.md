Own a startup means starting a company to sell products or services.

This is what you want to do?
Be a company owner??

Well this is easy to get. 
Being a successful needs a lot of work and experience.

I agree with Slatecaster : Do some soul-searching and discover what you want to do..

There's nothing glorious about being a startup owner, unless your startup is successful and brings value to its customers.

What are your interests? Are you looking to make a pile of cash or would like to have fun with it (rich or king dilemma)? And what do you mean to "own a startup"? Do you want to buy or start one? What do you want to be when you grow up? 

Before you spend any money pursuing this idea, do some soul-searching. Nobody can give a suggestion better than you can do it yourself.  Good luck with whatever you decide to do.

In all of your experience in HR, have you come across a problem that could be solved or improved with technology? It seems to me that would be a perfect place for you to start.

<p>I think there may be a value in creating a company targeting small businesses which would help them first understand how technology could add value to their business and then find professionals who could implement that for them. </p>

<p>Right now, big firms have technology consultants helping them create value through the web, but as the internet gets more commoditized, smaller firms can start to hire people to create software for them. I think there will be many people who would love to use <a href="http://www.odesk.com" rel="nofollow">ODesk</a> or <a href="http://www.elance.com" rel="nofollow">Elance</a> to get some of their nagging issues solved or optimized through technology however they dont know a. what is possible, b. what kind of person could do it for them at Odesk. </p>
