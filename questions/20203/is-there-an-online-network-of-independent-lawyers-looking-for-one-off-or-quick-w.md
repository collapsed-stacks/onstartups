I'm looking for a network that matches lawyers to people looking to get a contract written or have a bit of legal work done. I know there are lots of freelancing sites and networks out there for logo design/graphics work, but is there a good equivalent for legal work?

check out fizzlaw.com - a network of attorneys experienced working with small businesses and startups (lawyers don't paid to be listed, it's built on referrals and research). You can use the find-a-lawyer tool to send out to your request to the network and only interested attorneys will respond.
