Recurly recently revamped their pricing model.  Previously, subscribers would pay $69 plus $0.10 per transaction.  Now, the cost is 1.25% + $0.10 per transaction with a $69 minimum per month.  This new fee includes the new Recurly Gateway, so the idea is that you would not need to pay a "Gateway fee" to your current processor.

Unfortunately, I have no idea how this compares to my current total processing cost.  I've only ever seen a blended processing rate from my current provider, so I don't know what the "Gateway" portion of that fee is.  It's something I'm going to look into, but in the meantime, I'm interested in hearing what everyone else things about this pricing change.

Also, Recurly is grandfathering existing users at their current plan, however these users will not get access to any new features.  There is already a new "Subscriber Retention Report" that is unavailable to grandfathered users.

<p>I think recurly's pricing is too much now... Minimum of $69/mo, .10 a transaction... you are going to pay 2 - 3% with your merchant account and then 1.25% to Recurly... So it's not so good.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.stripe.com" rel="nofollow">Stripe</a> - great credit card processing, and supports recurring payments. It's a flat 2.9% and they serve as your gateway.</p>

<p>I've been moving my projects over to it.</p>
