Whats the best way to promote your website if still in beta? I have a sign-up page for anyone who wants to create their own social trivia game, but the platform hasn't launched yet. Where can I get people to see this page and sign-up?

<p>The good news is right now there are several sites that want to help you do just what you're asking.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://betali.st/" rel="nofollow">Betali.st</a> is run by a very friendly and helpful guy, and his web site/twitter feed/email blasts reach thousands of people.</li>
<li><a href="http://launchrock.com/" rel="nofollow">LaunchRock</a> is building some helpful tools that encourage viral sharing (to some degree) of your sign-up page, with people sharing the news about your startup in order to get a higher position in the beta invite list.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.betacandy.com/" rel="nofollow">BetaCandy</a> promotes startups to their audience by way of special offers (kind of like Groupon for startups).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many avenues to explore.  But there's no substitute for working hard and making a good product that people <em>want</em> to use and <em>want</em> to see succeed.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
