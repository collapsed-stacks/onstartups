I've been running a software startup for the last year - basically the business model is that I customize the software products released under GPL for my end customers. These customizations are quite major, so I would like to brand the original open source product with my own branding.

 1. Under GPL, can I legally put my own logo & copyright, considering that I have made significant changes?
 2. Is there anything that I have to be careful when I am branding, since I do not want to run into legal issues.

I am not a lawyer - but from what I understand:

1. You can change the branding as much as you like, you may change the logo, name and everything else.

2. You may not remove or change the copyright notices, but you can add another copyright notice next to it (the exact wording is way behind my expertise but I guess that if you use "portions copyright ABC" or "based on XYZ copyright ABC" you'll be safe).

3. You must give the full source code including your modifications to your clients, this code must be licensed under the GPL (so the client can change it, resell it or give it to someone else if they want to).
