I have been looking into creating a site that incorporates multiple area artists' work into a centralized shopping experience. Basically, there would be an option to purchase the original and an option to purchase a print.

I am looking for a cart/merchant processing solution that follows through to a local printer of my choice (based on [quarterly?] renegotiations based on through-put and vendor performance). Although I am familiar with online sites that process prints (and have their own solutions) it would be preferred if I could use a local.

Which solutions allow for vendor selection? Are these solutions cumbersome in comparison with those sites that you simply upload the pictures and wait for processing? (...and yes, they're pretty decent prints from those sites so assume quality is equal across the board).

Not sure why you were voted down?  I am unsure of any print queue integrated with consumer ecommerce solutions out there.  This may be something you develop on your own (or at least we had to).  The upside is though this should not necessarily be a hard problem to solve.  Every major print shop allows for electronic submittal for pre-paid pickup.

Edit: in summary, I don't believe there is any pre-packaged service software.  I may be wrong, but none of which I know.  You may need to roll your own.  (and maybe resell said service as a side operation?)
