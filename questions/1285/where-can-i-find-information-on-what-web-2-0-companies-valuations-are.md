Does anybody know of any source where I can find out what 'real' valuations internet startups are getting? 

The term 'real' valuation is totally made up, but I mean what actual investors are paying. So if an investor pays $1 million for a 10% stake in company X, then company X has a 'real' valuation of $10 million.

Thanks.

EDIT: As per Tim's request, this is my intention behind the question.  1) We had somebody offer to do work for N% equity.  We felt N was too high, but don't have a clue what to counter offer.  And 2) We feel that we should always have some clue how much it's worth so we'll be prepared for future investor and/or buyer opportunities.

I don't think there's a public source of the information you are seeking (because these companies are privately held).

There's information on the amount of funding raised, but not the actual valuations.

There are some numbers mentioned for Wufoo and a few others in one of the workshop presentations from FOWA 2009 Miama - I was looking at it yesterday.  Go check out their website under the Miama content and view the presentations.

Since I don;t have the points necessary to comment I have to ask the question in the answers portion - why do you want this information?  Maybe there is another way to get to the result you want without that?
