The web is full of gallery websites for CSS design. e.g:

- http://www.css-showcase.com
- http://www.cssmania.com
- http://www.awwwards.com

Is there such a thing for startups?

I've also used...

http://www.killerstartups.com/

http://www.feedmyapp.com/

http://www.startupnorth.ca/ (if you're Canadian)

Depending on the type of startup, there's likely niche related sites. 

I suggest doing a google search for your competitor, look who's linking to them, and submit to the same sites. A search would look like: 
>link:www.whatever.com
