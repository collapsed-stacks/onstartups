<p><strong>Background:</strong>
I am a US Non-resident and have no connections (personal or business) with the US. I have an online portal that sells apparel.</p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> 
A global customer buys an apparel from my site, using credit cards. Lets say at 50 USD.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> 
I forward this order to the facilitation service company's (FSC) site. The FSC is located in the US. It will manufacture, print and even ship the apparel for me directly to the customer. I just have to order the same design from them, paying by my credit card. Lets say I order the same apparel for 45 USD.</p>

<p>Questions: <br/>
1. Should I register a Company in the US? <br/>
2. Should I have any reseller permits or license?<br/>
3. Do I need anything specific for this situation?</p>

<p>Any response will be highly appreciated.</p>
