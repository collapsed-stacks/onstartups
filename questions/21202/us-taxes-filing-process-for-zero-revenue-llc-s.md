I am currently employed full-time but the rest of my time is spent on my startup LLC.  I was wondering when the US taxes deadline is for LLCs and, more importantly, what the filing process is when you have only expenditures and $0 revenues.  I had heard from a friend that filing for business was on March 15 but filing personal taxes was due April 15. Any guidance would be highly appreciated in this matter. 

Thanks,

Li Zhou

<p>I am not a CPA, but I have two LLC's of which I am the only employee.</p>

<p>On the federal level you file your LLC when you file your personal taxes, so that would be April, you can read more are <a href="http://www.irs.gov/" rel="nofollow">irs.gov</a>. Your filing should be pretty straight-forward if you are zero revenue.</p>

<p>The IRS would like you to file quarterly estimated payments of $0 so they can keep an eye on you, but legally you should only have to mention the LLC on your personal filings as a $0 company. This changes if you want to claim expenses for the LLC, but if you don't it's pretty simple.</p>

<p>Now, state and local taxes all depends on where you are. In my locality I have to file by March 1st, whether there was revenue or not.</p>
