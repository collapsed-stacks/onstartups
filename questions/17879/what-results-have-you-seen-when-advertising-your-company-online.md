I wanted to know if any one here has used any of the following methods to advertise their startup company and what results have they seen?

 - Google Ads
 - LinkedIn Ads
 - FaceBook Ads
 - Online Press Releases
 - Dynamic Ad listing service

These are typically services you have to pay for, but you are guaranteed a certain percentage of online displays that you can track using their tools to see metrics like click thru rates and such.

Are there other ad services that I did not list that you have tried?  Lessons learned?

Any info would be useful as I start to market my site and explore all the options available.

I used both Google AdWords and Facebook Ads. I blogged about the stunning results: http://blog.fairsoftware.net/2010/07/22/facebook-ads-crush-google-adwords-for-the-founder-conference/

Your mileage will always vary, but if I was Google, I'd be very concerned about Facebook right now (and they are :-)
