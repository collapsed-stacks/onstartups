I am looking to purchase/obtain a list of specific US businesses in niche categories such as photographers, salons, spas, dentists, etc to populate a website/app. Very similar to companies such as **Yelp** or **Angies List**.

There seems to be a few options:

 1. **Download a database from services like Factual**. Their US Places
    product but the listing categories are very vague so its hard to
    narrow businesses down to a specific niche. For instance,
    photographers are categorized under creative services, as are a
    million other types of businesses.
 2. **Purchase lists from services like InfoGroup**. That can get very expensive, very quickly for a new startup and i'm not sure i'm even allowed to display the data on the web.
 3. **Custom crawling by services like 80legs**. Seems promising, but
    again cost is an issue. Building custom crawl packages can get into
    the thousands of dollars per month.
 4. **Buy a database from the "cheap" companies usually listed in Google Adwords**. They offer an entire database of US
    businesses for around $200. Which sounds ideal, but because of the
    low pricing...i'm sceptical. Last thing I want is to build an
    application around outdated data that provides no real value and a
    frustrating experience to the user.

Without using an API (must be a downloadable database in CSV or TXT format) what is most accurate source of business listings for the money? Are the "cheap" lists accurate? What is the most common method of obtaining this data these days?

I remember I needed a database of local businesses too so I know what you mean. Personally, I went with what you call the "cheap" $500 version that you can find online. Even if the database is not 100% perfect (none are), you'll be able to get your site live. Then, as your company grows, you can always buy a more expensive database.

So my recommendation is to go with the cheap non-exhaustive option for now.
