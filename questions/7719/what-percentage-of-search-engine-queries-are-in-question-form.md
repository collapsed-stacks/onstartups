I'm curious about the percentage of searches on major search engines (Google, Yahoo, etc) that are questions. I've noticed a recent proliferation of Q&A focused sites, like this one. Is there a trend towards more questions being asked on search engines?

I don't know the percentage, but there's more.  I've read articles about that phenomenon, also about how average query length is much greater now than before.

I don't think it's because of Q&A sites per se, but rather because if you search for something short and general (i.e. "baby sleep") you'll get a ton of unrelated results -- products, companies, blogs, whatever -- whereas if you search for "5 month old baby won't sleep in swing" you're more likely to get something relevant to your actual problem.

You know, not like I have *that* problem or anything....
