## How to document transfer pricing policy for IP

In Europe, there is enormous tax differences between high tax and low-tax jurisdictions for holding IP (for example 60% for owners of a "3:12" Swedish company vs 5% for a Luxembourg IP company).

So even for a startup, some amount of tax planning/education needs to be done IMO.

For IP, one often has a transfer pricing policy for how one does pricing of transfers of IP rights, and for licensing of IP.

I understand that this is lawyer meat usually, but I feel that this is something that one just have to deal with, so I wonder if there are standards for this that one can use to avoid the expensive lawyer route?

This is a challenging area, so I suggest some legal advice is worth investing in. However, you *may* be able to use a set of principles around transfer pricing that should mitigate some, if not all, of the legal risk.

The main driver, as I understand it, is the notion of **arms-length** pricing. You need to be able to demonstrate to the tax authorities on both sides, if audited, that the price you charged for IP is calculated in a fashion that would be no different if you were transferring that IP to a 3rd party company, rather than a firm that is a member of your group/holding company, or even to a firm where it can be shown that you have a sufficient (equity) interest for there to be a (potential) conflict of interest.

You will be in hot water if the taxman thinks that you are massively under-pricing the IP as you transfer it between entities in a group or that you have a financial interest in.

Update (as a result of your comment):

This becomes the more general question then, of how one attaches a value to IP. The answer is not an easy one. 
Some thoughts are:

* how much did it cost you to make the IP (e.g., time, materials, etc)? This, you could argue, is fair value (and indeed, doing so would be best from a TP perspective, as the value should be the lowest of all the valuation techniques available to you).
* how much could you make if you monetised the IP into a product and sold it for a period of time. You could then do a Discounted Cash Flow analysis of this cashflow projection to work out a fair value.
* how much would a 3rd party pay for this IP? If you could obtain 2-3 objective, 3rd party estimates or "offers" for the IP, it would strengthen the basis of the valuation.
* can you cite cases where IP of a similar class/category was valued from an arms-length perspective that can add credence to your valuation of your own IP?

There are a number of ways of valuing a company which would incorporate or suggest models for doing this.

I'd guess that the taxman is *not* going to be an expert on this, any more than you will be. As long as you can meet the arms-length test you *should* be clear of tax troubles.

Its probably worth talking to an accountant, or buying a book on the subject. 

It goes without saying though, that this will all depend on the nature and complexity of the IP under consideration.
