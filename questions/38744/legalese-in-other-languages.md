I recently translated my app to German and Spanish. The German translator recommended leaving the copyright notice in English while the Spanish translator translated it. Which is better? My app is copyrighted and trademarked in the US.

P.S. Same question for my privacy policy.

I would translate everything, since it definitely increases the chances that your legal notices are considered valid by a foreign court. It's true that English is generally accepted in Germany, but better to be safe than sorry.

The fact that your intellectual property was filed in the US is irrelevant. If you want to extend the protection, you should file a [European Trademark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Trade_Mark).

About the Privacy Policy, be aware that the regulation in Europe are different. Make sure you meet the [safe harbor requirements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles).
