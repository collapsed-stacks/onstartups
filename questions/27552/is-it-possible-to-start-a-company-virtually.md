I plan to start a web project which will be an advertising company. Providing a service where a publisher and advertiser can connect with each other and start the ads posting agreement. Something like buysellads.com

At the moment I am a self employeed and not working for anyone. I do not have any company yet but I would like to start one. I'm from Indonesia and right now I am in China.

I want to ask if it is possible for me to start a company virtually? I mean start a company and everything will be done from internet(email communication or phone). Sending legal document(ID) with email or send to related address physically and so on.

I do not know yet where the address should be. At the moment I have virtual addresses in New Zealand and USA.

Do you guys think it is possible to start a company virtually like in New Zealand or USA or any country?

I just want my project to have a company.

<p><strong>Regarding starting a 'virtual' company:</strong> You cannot start a true 'virtual company'. Corporate structures are given by law, and your company will need to have a registered domicile (home address) somewhere. (This could be at the office of an attorney or chartered accountant working for you.)</p>

<p>That said, you should take a <a href="http://foundrs.com/incorporate-startup-online" rel="nofollow">look at Foundrs.com</a>. It's a service, which in part provides a lower-friction way of setting up partnerships, based on sensible legal contracts. You can then later 'move' this partnership to a real company if/when needed.</p>

<p>That said, I think you should consider <strong>why</strong> you need a company. You could start off by <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/incorporation">looking at the "Incorporation" tag</a>. Keep in mind that:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can do lots of idea generation, early business development etc without having a company yet.</li>
<li>Where you choose to incorporate is a very important decision; it will set which laws your company is subject to, including fx tax laws.</li>
<li>Don't wait too long! An important aspect of incorporating is risk management. As you do business, you take on some legal risks. If you <em>personally</em> do the business, then these risks are <em>yours</em>, and in the extreme a potential future creditor could seize your property. It is far better to have a <em>company</em> hold these risks, and compartmentalize them there.</li>
</ul>

I think the goodness of computer world is that, you can start your business without having a company first, thus minimizing ROI risks financially, then you can start your physical company. I think you should first deploy your application and during your business, you can judge if you really need a **company**? I mean, maybe you can achieve what you want without having one.

You can start a company in Delaware, USA. But the main problem is that you cannot open a business bank account there or at may be you have to flight in the US. So you should open a company in Indonesia. Otherwise, in your project is interesting, you could find a partner in the US or UK.

sure, you can use services like http://www.ocra.com/ but they are not cheap (they aren't expensive neither, sometimes just expensive for a startup).
