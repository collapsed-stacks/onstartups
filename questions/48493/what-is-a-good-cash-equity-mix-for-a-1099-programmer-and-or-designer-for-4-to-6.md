We have been coding now for about 6 months on our startup.  Up until now, we have bootstrapped the entire project on pennies, being cash poor.  Fortunately we were able to raise a small friends and family round of about $50,000, which is great because it has become increasingly clear that we need to bring on at least one more coder, and a good designer. 

For now, we would like to offer a 1099 position with a cash/equity split.  The job should last for about 4 to 6 months, with the possibility of full time employment soon thereafter.  Since our cash reserves are still low, we are offering equity to keep the hourly compensation reasonable.  

My question:  What is a good cash/equity mix for the above scenario, including vesting options, and possible future employ?  Open to all and any suggestions.

FYI...we are located in Sacramento.

Thank you in advance for your help...as it is very appreciated!

There is no standard formula here, it's all about what you're willing to offer and what they're willing to accept. To make this simple enough, here is what I would do:

 1. Give the person you're getting on board enough money to properly spend on themselves during that 4-6 months period. The amount should be enough for them for their basic needs, and a bit more for their recreational activities. 
 2. The equity depends on how much valuable the company is. Since it's still starting, I suggest you get into an honest discussion with whoever you're hiring, and reach an agreement on how much the company will be worth once it starts generating income. After that, you can give them equity accordingly.
