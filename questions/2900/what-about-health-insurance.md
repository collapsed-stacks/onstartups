Lately I have been considering quiting my day job and working on my website business ideas full time but everytime I sit down and run the numbers I come to the same consulsion, I can afford everything but health insurance.  Is there any secret out there where someone starting a business can get decent health insurance thats affordable?

Thanks,

Frank

At least in the USA, I would speculate your dilemma is very common amongst prospective entrepreneurs and existing small business owners. Besides myself, I know several other self-employed individuals who have had difficulty acquiring and/or maintaining affordable health insurance.

Until recently, I was on a high deductible individual policy, paired with a health savings account (HSA). An HSA allows you to put money in tax free, earn interest tax free, and withdraw it tax free. Even if you subsequently take full-time employment, any money left in the HSA can still be used for health expenses (unlike a medical savings account through employers, which requires you spend the money or lose it). In comparison with COBRA, this option was about 1/3 of the cost to cover myself and my family. My family and I recently switched over to my wife's employer plan; however, in hindsight we actually liked our individual coverage more - especially the HSA part.

In addition to COBRA and professional associations like IEEE, you might also check if there's a small business association in your state. For example, in Arizona (my home state), there is a small business association which offers group health insurance (see http://www.asba.com/benefits/health_insurance.aspx). I'd also ask around with other small business owners in your area - Even if they work in an entirely different field, they can likely give you some suggestions.

In general, I suggest you leave no stone unturned in researching your health insurance options. Perhaps with a few more hours of phone calls to insurance companies, research on the internet, and asking around with other small business owners, you might be surprised what you can find.

By the way: Unfortunately, I don't think IEEE is allowing members to sign up for their group policy (see http://www.todaysengineer.org/2006/Dec/plan-pt2.asp). Until I learned of this, this was my first choice for health insurance.

COBRA is your best option. Keep you covered for 2 years which should be long enough. You still have to pay but it is probably cheaper than buying it on your own.

Google COBRA.

Like Steve, I have been using a high-deductible plan coupled with an HSA.  

You will end up paying out of pocket for many things that you may be used to getting free but it's a great and relatively inexpensive option to cover a catastrophic event such as a major surgery.  

The savings account component functions as a safety net and you get the benefits of a tax deduction.  

Your insurance options will vary by state.  I am in Washington and use the LifeWise WiseSavings plan: https://www.lifewisewa.com/lwwa/groups/public/documents/pdfs/018102.pdf

For the HSA, I use https://www.hsaadministrators.com/.  They let you invest your savings in Vanguard funds and it's very straightforward to set up and use.

COBRA often tends to be quite expensive.  I've been considering this issue too, and I'm planning on going with the high-deductible personal plan that other people have mentioned.  Online sources like ehealthinsurance.com offer a broad variety of plans on a month-to-month basis.

It depends if you are a member of a professional organization, or some other group that may offer insurance.

For example, I am a member of IEEE, so I can get insurance from them at a reasonable cost, for medical, dental and vision as well other other types. They offer this because many of their members are consultants, so self-employed.

If you're in California, most health providers are required to offer similar terms to small businesses as they offer to large ones. This requires insuring at least 3 employees to be eligible, and they all have to be working at least 20 hours, but once your COBRA runs out, that's a reasonable option.

**ACM -- Association for Computing Machinery**

If you're working with computers, you may qualify for an ACM membership, and they have a group health plan.
