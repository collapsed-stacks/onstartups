I am considering choosing between these two. Does anyone have any experience with Adbrite?. What are the pros and cons?

Adbrite and Adsense offer similar services. The upside of Adbrite is that you can make more money, it rarely bans publishers (unlike Adsense) and is super easy to get into the program, even with a less trafficked site. The only downsides are that sometimes Adbrite doesn't match the ad to the page content, and that there are a lesser amount of advertisers. Hope this helped.
