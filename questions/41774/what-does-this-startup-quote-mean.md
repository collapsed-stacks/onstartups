Why is it the biggest mistake? (to invent a distribution channel and a new product category at the same time)

Because now you have to convince people to do 2 things: buy into something new AND do business differently.

One or the other is hard enough. Both together - it's like launching a new TV station, but you can only access it with a propitiatory box. Even if the box is free, it's still a big step.

Because  that way basically you will not have customers to sell to. 

New distribution channels work great but with well known products that the masses are using and looking for.

New products are hard to sell because you have to educate people how the new product is better than the rest. 

I guess with new product and new distribution channel you will have product that people don't know they need as well as they do not know where to buy it from.

Basically, with a new product and new distribution channel it's like starting all over again. You don't have anything to go off of. 

If you're launching a new product to seasoned distribution channels, they're more likely to succeed as you already know the audience. 

If you're launching a new distribution channel, it's more likely to succeed because you have the products reputation to build off. 

If you' try both...you have nothing to build off.
