With the freemium model. Should we launch the FREE offerings first, then BUILD and sell the premium stuff, or have at least one premium service available before lauch?

I would launch the free version first for three reasons:

 1. **Spread the word:** You'll get more people trying out your product if it's free. By increasing your initial pool of users, you'll increase the number of people that will learn about your product through word of mouth and online buzz. Giving you more potential users to convert to paying customers.
 2. **More Feedback:** This is really tied to number 1 above. The more people you have using your product, the more feedback you're likely to get. Giving you more opportunities to improve your product, and develop what people really want.
 3. **Modularity:** Theoretically, your free version will be a basic version of your paid version. Meaning, your paid version will use the free version as a platform, and all you'll do is add more features to the paid version. So you'll end up having to develop your free version first anyways.

Launch now! Take a look at the startup ecosystem: the overwhelming majority of the startups you know, use, and love launched with a free plan first, then added more premium features later on. You'll still have the users you gained with the free model, and you can get started earlier.
