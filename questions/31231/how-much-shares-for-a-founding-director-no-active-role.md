I am about to register an online technology company in a country where I am not a citizen or permanent resident (PR). Law requires me to appoint a local citizen or a PR as a company "director" in order to be able to register company in that country.

I wonder what do you think how much shares should I offer to this "founding director" considering I don't expect him/her to take any active role in the company (at least for now) and their role is purely to comply with the legislation in order to be able to register a company.

It's a bootstrapped start-up and I can't offer any salary especially since this "role" is only admin and not an active business role.

Thanks

0 shares - pay them hourly or some fixed fee for their efforts.
