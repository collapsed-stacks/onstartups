We recently launched our word of mouth advertising startup, www.boostria.com. We want to rapidly grow our user base to mature our system. But it takes lots of time/effort to sign new users. So, my question is:

Is it a good idea to pay users to sign up to my service? What are the pros/cons?

Thanks
James

Clint,

Thank you for the input. I would like to response with 3 points

 1. Maybe the "word of mouth advertising" slogan is misleading, but, we help to boost businesses with **short stories**; we encourage people to write an interesting story, rather than a personal review. Take one of our advertise laterdog.com as an example, one booster signed up as "a dog", and speak her boosting message like this "***So, my owners were going on a vacation. They had no idea what to do with me, so they went to www.laterdog.com. It changes you, man. I'm a whole new Labrador***.". This is really nothing different from a actor doing a commercial on TV, right?

 2. I agree with you on "don't sell out to your F&F", so we don't publish stories into users' Facebook, Twitter, other social network account. Instead, you publish stories into opt-in publishing sites like Google AdSense did. So the scenario of "selling to your family and friends" does not exist. 

 3. Lastly, I believe that Word of Mouth (WOM) is about transparency. So we mark every sponsored boosting clearly with "sponsored by..." label. It is up to the users to decide whether the story is interesting enough so they want to click the site to learn more.

Does this make better sense?

Are you referring to paying users to write stories? Or paying advertisers to post opportunities?

In terms of the former, giving some form of incentive, whether cash or some piece of merchandise might be a good way to get people on the site. Since people are paid for the actual writing they do (though you might want to show how much that could be per click), you probably don't want to pay for the writing itself. So a better approach might be to say that the first 100 people to write an article/boost will get a gift card, or a t-shirt, or whatever.

In terms of the advertisers, you don't really want to pay directly, though you may want to consider giving reduced rates on the first 100 advertisements , which you seem to be doing already.

Paying for *word of mouth* is a bad business model!

Read *Word of Mouth Marketing* by Andy Sernovitz and you will know why.

Joel Spolsky, the founder of this very site's software, has stated publicly that paying people as a motivator doesn't work. Do a Google search for specifics.

Word of mouth is organic. You spread the word to your friends and family (F&F) because you honestly feel some product or service gave you value and can benefit them as well.

Ask yourself, would you recommend something to your close F&F just because you were paid to do so? I wouldn't. First, if I recommended a bad service (because I didn't use and vet it first), it could impact my reputation. Second, if my F&F found out I was getting paid, they would label me as a sell out (i.e. trying to capitalize on them).

Word of mouth occurs natually when you provide value to your customers (i.e. they get more than they *feel* they paid for).
