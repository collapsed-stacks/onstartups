I read that creating communities are key to sustainability of a website.  Big site like FB, google, started with a small community in this case the univ students.  

I thought since I will be launching a website soon, I should try the same, I thought my neighborhood would be a good choice. 

But for started how can I get this community to be my first few loyal users who would spread the word? Any sort of incentives I can provide them with. 




PS- admins - My questions is specific this time, please do not close it. thanks

If you are "launching soon", but don't have any idea who your customers will be, how to reach them and how to motivate them, may I humbly suggest you drop everything else and concentrate on that for a while.

If I were you, I'd get a few customers signed up ASAP, at least as unofficial advisers, so you can let them guide you in building what you need.

In the meantime, read Lean Startup, Crossing the Chasm, Purple Cow, etc, etc.
