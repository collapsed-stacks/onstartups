I'm a web developer and I live in Iran. Unfortunately my country is under international sanction. However, I'm able to work for foreign customers and get their job done. But there is a problem. A big one actually. I don't have an international account, and our banks are also under sanction. PayPal closes created account permanently for Iran IPs. 

How can I do my money transactions in this situation?

Note: Please don't tell me that it's impossible, as that is the most disappointing answer. Any idea is welcomed. Any payment method may work for me.

<p>Try <a href="http://bitcoin.org/clients.html" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin</a> ;) No legal block possible - if you can find someone exchanging it to your local currency.</p>

How about go to another country? You probably have family, properties and other important things in Iran, but to move is a good option to consider if it doesn't offer the proper opportunities for you to work.

There are money transfer companies that can send funds to Iran. Western Union doesn't seem to, but Sarrafi says it does (easily found on Google).

Of course, it may be difficult to convince people to use a service like that, but that is another story.

Alternatively, there are lots of Iranian people in the UK, for example, with banking facilities, so maybe you know some relative or other trusted third-party who could act as agent for you.
