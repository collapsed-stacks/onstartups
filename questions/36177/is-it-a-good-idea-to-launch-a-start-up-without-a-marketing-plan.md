My friend and I have invested $40-$50 k in a website we are launching in April. We have full time jobs but put all our savings into this project. We are done with the development phase and are currently doing bug fixes and user testing. 
Questions - 

1. We do not have a marketing plan yet. Our plan is to launch the website bug free, then think about the marketing plan. We do not even know if we will start to target one city or multiple. Is this a good idea or is this the path to failure? 

2. Beta Testers - what is the best way to get users give their honest opinions on our product. Should we post on criags list that we will pay $40 - $50 an hour to users who will test our website and share their experience? Is there any website for such users? 

3. Any other comments are welcome. I apologize for not sharing the idea because it is not an exisiting one. But as Paul Graham says, execution matters, we are worried we might not be able to execute it well. 

Thanks

<p>Well, I think the horse is already out of the barn. The marketing plan would have come in handy before spending the $40k-$50k. But it sounds to me like you need more than a marketing plan - sounds like you need a business model. You might want to take a look at the <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/book" rel="nofollow">Business Model Generation</a> book. It will help you organize all of your strategies and perhaps come up with a better launch plan.</p>

<p>To answer your original question, I would not launch without a marketing plan. The reason is that you only get to launch once. This is an opportunity to build excitement and anticipation around your launch and pre-build your beta-testing list (not to mention email marketing list) before hand. Don't waste the only launch you'll ever have.</p>

To answer question 2, i dont think that you should be paying beta testers, i feel that the people who would give you the right type of feedback would be those wanting to try it anyway and depending on what has been built it might be a case that some would feel privileged to try it.

Also by paying them it might influence their feedback, some people tell you what you want to hear, not what you need to hear.

Without being paid a penny, many will test something and share their experience, either with you or the outside world as long as you allow them to speak freely, so if they hate it let them tell you at least.

<p>It looks like you need a plan, and marketing is just a part of it. You are planning on a bug free website. I have never seen one. The biggest potential bugs you have yet to address is marketing, and testing.</p>

<p>As a site for potential testers, you might be able to use <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" rel="nofollow">mechanical Turk</a> by Amazon. Are you testing the website or the product?</p>

If you are too busy to do it yourself, why not outsource marketing to someone who has a proven track record?

With your guidance, a marketing specialist can help effectively sell your product for you.
