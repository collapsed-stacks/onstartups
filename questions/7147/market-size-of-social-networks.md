Obviously determining Market Size is a vital step in starting a business. With ecommerce or the sale of a product it seems to be a much more concrete process. On that note, does anyone have any advice as to how one would compute market size for a social networking site? Does anyone know how sites like facebook, linkedIn, Ning, etc. compare? 

What about (non-sicial network) sites like StartUpToDo.com or 37Signals.com?

Thanks

Well 37signals is not a social network. They are however probably the only company that is profitable.

The market size of social networks are potentially limitless but even though it's fairly easy to make revenue it's very hard to be profitable.

First and foremost because most social networks are ecosystems and start out as free.

Second of all because it's very hard to get people to pay to work which is potentially what they do when they join a social network.

But you can work with the following parameters to determine potential market.

1. Advertising
Google ads, Premium Ads (ala those on Smashing Magazine)

2. Subscription
Well.com as I have been a member of for 10 years now is a subscription based discussion forum. They haven't changed for years yet it's the place I know with some of the smartest people on the planet. You can course also calculate based on the "freemium" model 

3. Free to play, pay for sway.
This is very popular with habbohotel.com and with a lot of casual games.

If you want to calculate the market size I would suggest you simply multiply number of users with the unit prizes for the above mentioned possible models.

<p>One way is to compare their traffic. You can use one of the following tools:</p>

I just listened to a podcast of a Stanford seminar with DHH.  He said 37signals had 3 million users - but that data is over a year old.
