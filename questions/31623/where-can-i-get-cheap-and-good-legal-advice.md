I am looking for good/cheap legal advice for a web application my friend is building.

We will need to write a Term Of Service. 

- Do we really need a lawyer for that?
- Are there templates out there? 
- If not where can I get a good/cheap lawyer to help me make one?
- I have many legal related questions where should I go to get it?

I live in Canada. But I think I will need from US lawyers incase I get in trouble there.

Thanks in advance for any help.

I suspect that relying on cheap advice, while assuming that it is good will eventually yield an underwhelming outcome.

As they say: Good, Quick, Cheap - pick two.

I'm a lawyer- I'd recommend finding some precedents of the terms of service and drafting what you want, and then just running them by a lawyer.  That will save time and money.   Be prepared to pay a retainer, though.

Non-lawyers frequently think, "why did I pay a lawyer for that" but when problems arise down the road, you'll be glad that you did.  Consider a lawyer an ounce of prevention (of legal problems)...worth a pound of cure.

$500 is way too low for TOS + privacy policy.  A decent lawyer should bill at at least $250 an hour- if not more.

Avvo.com is a Q&A site with lawyers. There may be answers on there already that meet your needs.

<p>I'm afraid that Steve Jones answer (though well intentioned) is a bit of a clich√©. I've worked with plenty of lawyers who were expensive, slow and consistently underwhelmed with their results and knowledge of the law.  </p>

<p>I've become a big fan of taking responsibility to learn as much as I could and hire an attorney to do those things that require passing a bar exam to accomplish. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nolo.com/" rel="nofollow">Nolo.com</a> has a tremendous supply of lay oriented books, forms and law related educational materials. <a href="http://amazon.com" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a> is your friend as well.  Your local library often can order the more popular titles for reading free of charge.</p>

Since you are Canadian, you should definitely check out Rob Hyndman's (a pretty reputable lawyer) resources, in particular http://hyndmanlaw.com/blog/canadianized-wordpress-terms-of-use/

As per your questions:

 - no, you don't **necessarily** need a lawyer to write terms of service (TOS). TOS variations mostly depend on industry. But for example if you simply have a blog, the form above will probably be 100% covered. Of course, having a lawyer check out your TOS is a good idea that I will always recommend, but drafting them yourself might save some good bucks.
 - There are a lot of templates out there, but some of them are behind a paywall (and not even that good) or come from sketchy websites. The best technique is to have a look at competitors and get "inspiration" from their TOS. 
 - Unfortunately cheap + good is a very rare combo with lawyers. The average price of TOS + and privacy policy is around $500. Anyone who asks for more might be good, but is clearly a shark. Some Law Schools might have clinical programs where they give you free legal consultation, actually of good quality (professors check on students' work). Check out if there's one near you.
 - If you have a lot of legal questions, definitely go to a lawyer.
