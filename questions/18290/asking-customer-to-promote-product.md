I have a new customer that is very happy with my software. He asked about a feature that the software does not have, but would be simple for me to add and would be a good feature. I am thinking of telling him I would add it in exchange for some type of promotion. What would be a good thing to ask him to do? Write an article or review, post positive comments on relevant forums? What would you suggest?

Good customers will refer you anyway. I wouldn't do something "in exchange." Adding bargaining into the equation cheapens the relationship in my opinion. Just add the feature for him, since it benefits you too. You can also ask him for a recommendation to use on your site or whatever you want and my guess is that if he is like most people, he would be quite happy to do it without having to receive some kind of payback. In other words, look after him and he will look after you.

Try a referral model. Give him a new feature/update for free for every new paying customer he refers to you. Articles, reviews, forum posts are all things you can do.
