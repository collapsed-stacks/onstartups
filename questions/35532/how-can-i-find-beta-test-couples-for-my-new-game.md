I am having trouble finding test couples to beta test my new couples' game and website.  I have what I think is a great landing page,  and get good feedback on it but because it's for adults (not porn but definitely erotic) I can't post on many of the typical sites.  

Since it's not a computer game most gaming sites aren't the right fit.  I'm looking for couples that want to play a game of erotic exhilaration  while at the same time improving their relationship. The game has an on-line community where they can anonymously discuss everything they ever wanted about their sex life & hear what others are doing. Plus our Resident Experts add their input too.  The game is ever changing as the rules grow and change by the very members playing it. Test couples receive the game for free as well as an on-line membership as long as they participate.  I also offer cash award contests for best suggestions, feedback, etc.  I think my biggest issue is figuring out 'where' to post my information to find the couples. I have also featured my site on StartupLift, which btw got me extremely informative feedback on my website.  

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

You can get in touch with some erotic/sex shops, both online and physical and create a partnership.
Their customers would get the game for free - if they like, they may help spread the word - and you are already building a possible network of sales. 

Since it's a partnership, and in exchange of they recommending your game to their customers, you should give something back to the shops, like a couple of games for free for them to sell when it cames out.
