We (my partner and I) have been developing a twitter like application but with a goal to provide with some differentiators. Though I would love to share the links now but I am restraining myself as it is early for us to release it to the world.

We have some questions:

 1. Is there a market for a twitter competitor (considering all others in the playing field)?
 2. If we provide functionality which is more targeted towards the corporates where branding matters, will it help?
 3. As a company would you like to host a twitter like application from your server for a price?
 4. would you like to use a twitter like app for day-to-day updates for a group and pay for it (different charges for hosted mode and intra-network mode)?

I tried to be as clear as possible but in case you need more clarification please feel free to ask.

Cheers,
Samik

<p>Go for it, the best way to find out is to try it. </p>

<p>There is a company called <a href="https://www.yammer.com/" rel="nofollow">Yammer</a> that does what Twitter does for companies, of course this does not mean you shouldn't do it, all the contrary, it proves there is a market for it.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
