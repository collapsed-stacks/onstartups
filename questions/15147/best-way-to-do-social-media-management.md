I am aware that the use of social media is a must for most of the companies. When it is about my start up, what is the best way to manage them? In the beginning I will take care of them but thinking for growth, should I hire someone to take care of them or is it better to keep that task for myself?

It is time consuming. If you have the means to hire someone -- do it. It is not a must though -- it all depends on your business. if you are a government contractor making millions in defense sector, you're better off without a page on facebook. ;)

Also, have a very clear idea of what you are trying to do and why (just like every other activity).

Like Mark said, first of all, it's important you to know why you need be present on social media channels (ex.: Twitter)

After understanding why, it's time to know how you will make the things happen. For example:

If you will be present on Twitter, because you'd like engage your customers and provide a nice after-sales. You will need:

 - Attend all mentions about your brand;
 - Help your customers to resolver their problems;
 - Share relevant information about your services/products;
 - etc

You can look for some tool, that may help you and your demand. But the process of choice the tool, must be done, only after you had understood what you need to do.
