<p>I quite often see a limitation of liability clause in contracts...</p>

<p>Could anybody explain to me what this means in plain easy to understand English please?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing in these Conditions limits or excludes the liability of the Supplier
  for any liability incurred by the Customer as a result of any breach by the Supplier of the condition as to title or the warranty as to quiet possession implied by section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982.</p>
</blockquote>
