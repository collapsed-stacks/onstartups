I am trying to register a domain name for my incorporated company in Canada, BC.

[Mylastname]Soft Inc.

*[Mylastname] is not literal here.

I found [Mylastname]Soft.com already....

so I am thinking of registering [Mylastname]Soft.ca ....

Would a person think, only Canadian firms are covered and get bad impression ? Should I just stick with .com and get [Mylastname]Softinc.com instead ?

Large corporations have both (microsoft.com and microsoft.xx where xx is the country domain).

Simplify things for you: use the .com.

Or you can get both and use the .ca to advertise to Canada and the .com for international.

I agree that country-specific TLDs can leave a taste of "local-ness" to people outside your country.

I agree that you should start with the .com. 

I'd go further than Stefanos, though and suggest you register the .ca, but only redirect it to the .com for the moment. It leaves a possibility to use it as part of your marketing strategy later, but at this point, keeping it simple and focusing on the core of the business is more important.

I heard the founder of Honda Motor Company say once that his only regret was that he named the company after himself. I think he was expressing genuine humility.

Depending on your specific business, it could be advantageous to have a Canadian TLD for local SEO purposes.

If you are considering just the .ca then I would also purchase the .com and redirect it to the .ca.

If it were my company I would use the .com as my primary site.  You could use the .ca as a landing page when targeting Canadian users.

As I understand your question is that 
you are not able to get younameSoft.com. ( already taken by some one else) 
but you younameSoft.ca is available and yournameSoftInc.com as well. 

my suggestion would be 
if you are targeting international customer, then go for .com 
if you are targeting only candaian then you can consider only .ca with caution. (Since .com domain is de-facto)

otherwise most of the international customer will visit .com  domain first, before landing to your .ca domain. 
and if .com domain has the some similar business like yours then you probably doing -ve marketing for yourself.
