I have a small start up company, and when I first started raisng money some shareholders got antidutable shares. The company is moving forward and will need to raise more funding but new investors won't put in money when some of the other shareholders have antidilutable shares. 

Does anyone have any suggestions what would be fair to offer the shareholders to give up their antidilutable shares and how would I word it to the shareholders?

Convince other investors to buy them out.

That's the best way I can think of. 

Then be sure to tell your current shareholders that if they don't sell, or give up their non-dilutable shares, the company will fail and they'll lose all their money.
