<p>does anyone have experience with getting a TN visa (I am a Canadian engineer) as a tech cofounder (aka software engineer)? How did it go for you? How did you handle the equity-only part, the job title, and the fact that the company has no revenue?</p>

<p>I did some research and have a general idea of what needs to be done. I need a job offer letter and proof of qualification to make the request at my port of entry. But most information are assuming that the employer is an established company and for a typical employee position. We have a lawyer that can help us but we'd like to learn as much as possible before racking up the legal bill.</p>

<p>Check with a lawyer.... I don't think you can come in on a TN visa as a software engineer who is also the co founder of the company. Of course I don't think there is anyway they would know this.</p>

<p>The TN visa is setup for an employer\employee relationship. And the fact that the company has no revenue makes it even less likely for the TN visa.</p>

<p>Again you need to contact a lawyer for this.</p>
