I have an idea for a social network site. I know Facebook has many patents and I'm afraid of violating one of some of them. I'm not located in the US, main questions:

1. Do you think I should talk with a lawyer and ask him to check the patent of Facebook and other companies before I start to work on the idea? I think that to do that I'll need a few thousand dollars and this is something I don't have now. What I really want is to start working on the idea and then receive funding and then pay for things like a lawyer and patent. 

2. Will a lawyer in my country be enough to check patents in the US?

Thanks!

Regardless of what you'll start you will violate many of the ridiculous US patents anyway. So what, sit quiet and do nothing then?

Go ahead, start with your project and don't worry about US patents. When the time comes you'll register a company far away from the US so that legal disputes cannot be easily resolved in a US court. And when it crosses the Atlantic, the fact that Facebook is slowly becoming a security concern in many other countries may work in your favor.

Hopefully one day US demolishes its software patent system. Or due to the shift in economic powers nobody will care about them any longer.

Definitely consult with a lawyer. 

Start with a lawyer in your country and ask him if he can search US patents. 

In the mean time, keep working out your idea. There is a lot that can be done before actually going in to the production of it.
