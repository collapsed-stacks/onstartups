## Are fundamental business topics (e.g. accounting, administration, etc.) the same in Canada and the U.S.?

I never studied business formally, so to get a better understanding I figure I'd work through some textbooks used by business programs. However, I'm in Canada and most textbooks are from the U.S.

I know that each state and country has some unique rules regarding businesses, but will reading a book based on American business cause any disadvantage to running a Canadian company? The book in question is regarding Financial Accounting and I don't want to learn something that isn't fairly universal (or at least across the two countries).

Both the United States, and Canada follow GAAP guidelines, though there will likely be some country specific reporting standards that you should learn. 

For the basics of accounting though, you should be fine learning from an American book. As long as it purports to teach GAAP Accounting (Generally Accepted Accounting Principals).
