## What are typical advertising rates for national print magazines (like Time, the now defunct Newseek, etc.)?

I'm considering advertising in general national magazines. (So far we've only advertised in specialty magazines for our industry.)

I'm wondering what the range of rates is (for say, a 1/6 page color ad) per 1M (1,000) primary (not "pass along") readers.

<p>Many magazines have their media kits online.</p>

<p>Time Magazine: <a href="http://www.timemediakit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.timemediakit.com/</a>
Time's US national rates: <a href="http://www.timemediakit.com/us/rates-specs/national.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.timemediakit.com/us/rates-specs/national.html</a></p>

<p>For instance, a 1/3 page b&amp;w ad that runs 48x in a contract year will run you $99,300 per insertion or $4,766,400 for the full contract.</p>

<p>Links to the media kit can usually be found in the footer of the mag's main site. Some kits don't include prices, but many do.</p>

<p>each publication has different reaches and ad rates.  you need to contact each one and ask for a rate card. Or visit their website and see if they publish their rates ( <strong>example</strong>: <a href="http://www.quirks.com/advertise/print/adrates.aspx" rel="nofollow">Quirks</a> lists theirs, but this is unlikely with national magazines).</p>
