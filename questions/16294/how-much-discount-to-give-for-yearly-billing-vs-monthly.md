I have pricing plans ranging from $50 - $200 monthly. How do I figure out what to charge for annual billing?

Multiply your price by 12. Figure out what it is worth to you to have 12 months worth of money up front. Is it worth $25, or $50 to get the money early? Does your credit card processing add additional charges for 12 separate billing vs a single bill? Will some of your customers stop your service midway through a year long billing cycle? Will they be less likely to do so if you charge them a year's fee up front?
