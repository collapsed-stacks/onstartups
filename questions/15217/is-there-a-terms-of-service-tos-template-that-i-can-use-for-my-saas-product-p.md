I am at a point where I need to have a Terms of Service (TOS) page ready before I launch my SaaS product. Is there a template somewhere that I can use, or is this something that only a lawyer can help me with?

<p>I don't have much experience with this myself, but I've looked into it, and I found the following questions helpful (although you may have already seen them):</p>

<p>You can try the free privacy policy generator at <a href="http://www.freeprivacypolicy.com">http://www.freeprivacypolicy.com</a> and customize it for your needs.</p>

<p>Also the <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tos/">Wordpress TOS</a> is licensed under Creative Commons and seems to be a popular one to use as a template/base for your own.</p>

<p>I don't see anything wrong with using one of these templates to start off with. However, once your product starts getting some traction I would definitely have one drawn up for me by an attorney.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
