<p>ive got a brilliant idea for an app that will fix a problem for many! there is nothing like it out there. and while i know some about coding, its not enough to make this happen. seeing as how it would be a startup, i dont have much money yet. but seeing as how i know this will catch on quick(think snapchat in terms of ease of use and popularity) i would be willing to give stock or work out a deal in return for the help(possibly being the principal programmer for the long run if everything goes as planned as well). if someone could at least point me in the right direction if this isnt where i should be id appreciate it :)</p>
