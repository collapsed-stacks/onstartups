I am close to being done with my first iPhone app. I applied for a DBA but I signed up for an individual membership to the apple developer program (haven't received either yet).

Is it possible to switch an individual account to a business account? Or should I just shell out another hundred bucks?

You can switch, contact Apple. Unfortunately a DBA won't get you a company account, you need an actual company. (LLC, S/C Corp, etc if you're talking USA)
