Recency I read an article about growth of dropbox. Drop is growing with an amazing pace with 50 million users already with only less than 10% paid customers. They are expecting that next year their user base will be double the current number. And it seems even if they don't get even a single paid customer, they revenue would get doubled. How does this work?

<p>I read the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriabarret/2011/10/18/dropbox-the-inside-story-of-techs-hottest-startup/" rel="nofollow">Dropbox: The Inside Story Of Tech's Hottest Startup</a> article.  The reason they expect their revenue to double even if they don't get a single <em>NEW</em> user is because they expect more of the current 50 million users to become paying customers.</p>
