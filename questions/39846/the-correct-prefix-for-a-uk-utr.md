What's the correct country code/prefix for a UK unique taxpayer reference I should give in an invoice when supplying services overseas? I suppose it's simply UK, but I couldn't find anything about it on the Net. I found some articles regarding tax numbers in other countries, and they for example say that in Poland you should add PL before a tax number, that's why I suppose it'll be "UK" in the UK, so:

> UK 1234567890

Am I right?

<p>I think you're mixing up the Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) and VAT registration numbers.</p>

<p>A <strong><a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/information/help?helpcategory=cis&amp;affinitygroup=organisation&amp;helpid=companyUTR" rel="nofollow">Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)</a></strong> is a number given to individuals and companies and is a way for the tax people (HMRC) to idenitify you. </p>

<p>No one apart from you, your accountant and HMRC should ever need your UTR's unless you're in the <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1080728518&amp;type=RESOURCES" rel="nofollow">construction industry which has a special scheme (CIS)</a></p>

<p>A <strong>VAT registration number</strong> has different formats in different countries and is prefixed with the country code UK, PL etc. You should show your VAT number on invoices (assuming you're VAT registered). </p>

<p>You can find all the <strong><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/esl/country-codes.htm" rel="nofollow">formats for VAT codes issued by  EU countries here</a></strong> and you can <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/" rel="nofollow">verify VAT numbers here</a>.</p>
