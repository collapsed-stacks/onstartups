I want to start a business and have an opportunity to immigrate to US. I am at a crossroads in my life. I have a good business idea and need web developers and programmers to start my website as first step, but don't have enough money or experience to start my business in US and must find partner;co-founder;investors or VCs. but i can afford it in my country because the programmers are cheaper than US.
my country doesn't have a lot of expert people but have some smart student without experience and without entrepreneurship culture and are more cheaper than US. 
I like immigrate to US but fear of immigration's problems is an obstacle for me.

my questions:

1-how long does it take to me to start my online business in US? is it possible in first year?

2- should i take some experience in US and then start a business? can i learn business skills by going to college? should i start with cheap and physical jobs?

3- is immigration good for me in this situation? what is your opinion?

4- is it good idea to find some smart students in my country and make a team then start my business?

5- is location important for online business? 

I'm sorry for my English.   
hope to help.   
thank you very very much.

The standard solution that I have seen a number of immigrant entrepreneurs do is:

- start your business going now, at home, using the coders from home
- move to the US, register the business there, and be the 'business person' or 'hustler' on the team
- get out and known in an entrepreneurial network (classically Silicon Valley) and build your financing contacts/grow the business
- keep using your foreign programming team (ideally run by a close business partner you trust) as your secret weapon that people in the US don't have

This can give you the best of both worlds.

As for getting the US business experience, I prefer not to comment: it depends on you and what you want to do in the rest of your life. If you want to be an entrepreneur, just start doing it now. If you have other ambitions, then the advice here may not apply.
