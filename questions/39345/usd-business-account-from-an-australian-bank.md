My business is based in Australia and I receive all my customer payments in USD via PayPal. I'd like to transfer the money out of PayPal into a USD account. I don't want to do a currency conversion with PayPal because their exchange rates are extortionate.

I've queried a couple of Australian banks about USD business accounts. HSBC have a product but only for businesses with a turnover in excess of 3 million. NAB said they do it but then didn't seem too sure and wanted to charge USD50/month of something for the privilege.

Has anyone found a good USD business bank account product available from an Australian based bank?

HSBC.  I use their USD account for exactly this.  Exchange rate is pretty good.
