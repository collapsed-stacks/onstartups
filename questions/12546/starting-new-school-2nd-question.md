Also,

Initially we will be starting as a business/entrepreneurship school. I've toyed with two ideas for teachers. Experience entrepreneurs or somewhat experienced generalists that have great and dynamic personalities, but haven't necessarily started a business. 

Question: Experienced entrepreneurs as teachers or generalists (essentially facilitators), or both?

I'd like to suggest a third group: technologists.

As a technologist (web developer) who works with many startups, I've seen a lot of entrepreneurs get hamstrung by their own misconceptions about technology.  Even if it's just a guest lecturer or two, finding a way to expose your students to technologists they are likely to need to deal with in the business world would give them a strong leg up.

I see a lot of wasted money and missed opportunity stem from business types not understanding the technology their businesses rely on.  A good developer, engineer, IT guru, etc. can help a startup through many of those hurdles, but only if the startup's leadership knows how to choose a good technologist and work with him/her effectively.

To start out, take what you can get as long as they have the knowledge, can teach, and are motivated to do it.

I don't know the name, but in the US there is an organization of retired business people. Many would have liked to teach, but probably didn't have the time when they were working. 

Look for entrepreneuers who just sold their business. They may have time on their hands and are interested in sharing what they learned.

There are others who have specific knowledge in business as well and may be able to facilitate in areas of: accounting, finance, lending, banking, public speaking, business writing, marketing, etc.

And when your students use this site, make sure they tag their questions as Homework ;)

I think credibility is paramount when adults are paying for an educational experience. Why don't you survey your target customers and find out what qualities are most important to them in their teachers.

Speaking with my educator hat on, I think the best outcome would be people who have a mix of business experience and an understanding of current entrepreneurial theory and research. Happy to talk to you more about this if you want to PM me.

I agree with Jeff - people who have just sold their businesses are going to be ideal, because they have the experience of running the business, but they also have the time to devote to teaching.

If I were going to pay for such a school, I think I would want EXPERIENCED entrepreneurs.  I wouldn't be impressed by "somewhat experienced generalists that have great and dynamic personalities, but haven't necessarily started a business."

I have a a BA and Master's degree in teaching - I taught for many years, but now I now own my own website publishing company.  But I look back at my own college education - 80% of it was sitting through theory-type classes that didn't teach me anything useful.  The other 20% was real, down-to-earth practice stuff I actually used in my career.  Makes me feel like my 6 years of schooling should have taken much less time.

So my opinion:  Experience.  Experience.  Experience. 

Good luck to you!
