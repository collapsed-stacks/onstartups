I'm currently finishing up a business plan that's based on a social network that would solve a critical problem in the recruitment industry. 

I am working on this project with one other person who has the same level of experience I have - roughly 6 years in the work force. 

We have a mix of strong technical(QA Analyst, Business Analyst), Sales, and Business Development experience. We don't have the knowledge or resources to put together a prototype of our idea. 

How critical is it to have a working prototype in order to get seed funding? If not critical, what else do we need beside a business plan and passion? We think we have a winning idea that will scale, like everyone.. Thanks in advance for the feedback.

If you can't put together a prototype then your team is incomplete, and you are ask people to invest when you may not be able to build a suitable team.

That would mean higher risk, so they would probably want more equity, but, since your idea is just an idea right now, you don't even know how long it will take to build, so your numbers will be very suspect.

I haven't been through a VC round, as I am going the self-funding route, but, I would expect that the odds are very low with the risks being so high.

The farther along your prototype is the better off you will be, as you are able to then give a better idea as to how long before it could be complete, and to demonstrate some of the abilities, even if they are hardcoded.

At the very least your team needs to be complete, first, so you need an architect that has the ability to do what you want, and how fast he can do it will be based on resources available.

Funding is all about trust. 

My experience, we have people willing to seed-fund us only based on idea alone (except, we have worked together before). The investor said it bluntly, "I am funding you, not your idea". There is that trust involved that we are smart enough and won't mess up his money for no reason.

Having said that, we lose our interest for the investment. At that early stage, we knew we haven't proved most of our assumptions in real world. There are many things that might go wrong and i feel bad having to use that money just to prove the initial model. After all, i rarely see business plan work as how it is written.

That is good problem to have. If you haven't got that level of trust with someone or having a rich uncle (family, friends and foes), then your best bet is probably to get someone to do the screen-shot, do a cheap advertising campaign (Google Adwords / Facebook Ads) and prove that there is a traction to your idea.

Try to use oDesk, 99designs etc to do the screenshots. It should be affordable.

If you can prove that people are coming to your site, and clicking 'Sign up' or 'Register' even before you build the back-end, that means, you have something that people want. It's easier to convince investor with all those data available than just a 'plan' that full of assumptions.

If my explanation is unclear, maybe you want to do some reading about 'Lean Startup' or 'Minimum Viable Product'.

Hope that helps.

At the very least make some wireframes or screens that walk someone through the use cases.  

You're going to need technical people anyway, you might as well engage some now.  

You have to decide whether you want to bring on the technical talent as a cofounder or as hired help or outsourced.  Outsourcing is the worst option - you are taking a huge gamble there.

I think in order to be taken seriously you will need to have a technical person in the founders camp.  (not to mention higher chances of success)  

So, go find someone who can actually implement it.
