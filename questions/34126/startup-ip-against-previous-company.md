I am working as an SEM engineer for a California-based eCommerce company, and I want to leave and start my own SEM company. Are there any intellectual property concerns?

I would think it depends on your contract with your employer (e.g. Anti-Competition Agreements / Non-Compete clauses) which may indicate a cooling off period you have to wait for after leaving the company.

The most important thing is to make sure your are clean in terms of not taking anything that does not belong to you to new company, especially since it's in the same business. Be ethical in the spirit and letter of the law.
