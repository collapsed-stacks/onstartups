I am looking for an accounting solution. I have an online store where I currently use PayPal, Shopify, and of course my own bank. I have not been able to find a good accounting solution yet. I am currently using less accounting, but I would like to move to a one-time fee program. If any one has any suggestions please let me know! 
i am look for a accounting program that will incorporate at least paypal and my back account and i would like shopify as well if posible. I would also like there to not be a monthly fee to add such features as paypal to it. i have tried a few but none of them allow me to customize transactions as much as i would like. i hope that the added info helps 
Thanks,
Hanks

Let me put a plug in for Wave Accounting (http://waveaccounting.com). (Full disclosure: that’s where I work.)

Wave’s price point – free – so you won’t have to worry about a one-time fee or monthly payments to use our app. You can also connect to your bank account, including PayPal, to import your transactions. Once it’s connected, your transactions are automatically updated. 

Wave is 100% free to use, so you can give it a shot and see if it’s what you’re looking for. I hope this helps! Good luck.
