Given that you want to provide quality computer support for customers in the US remotely, via online chat, phone and screen sharing solutions, how would you go about advertising such service among potential clients?

We do Google Adwords, SEO, but none seems to work that well.

Google AdWords is worthy but somehow it generates junk traffic as well but as far as SEO is concerned; it should generate productive results for you if done right.

Regarding other advertising opportunities, I would suggest you below some SEO 2.0 techniques that can help you reach your targeted clients.

- Blog heavily and write mainly about the main features that your solution(s) provide.
- Moreover, try to build a viral-marketing circle by engaging enthusiast bloggers and reviewers to speak/write about your services.
- Then furthermore, create interactive videos/demos to let potential clients learn about what features are supported by your products/services, how they are unique and why they should consider you.
- Make use of social media and social + professional networking channels (FB, Twitter, LinkedIn, StumbleUpon) and try to connect with the targeted audiences, bloggers, users, companies and groups etc to get the social community engaged. Please note that social channel can generate swift results for you and your message can reach out to the walls of hundreds and thousands of potential users/clients.

You first need to have a target user in mind, the information you provided suggests you are targeting anyone in the US which is too generic. 

Lets pretend you are targeting stay at home mums or single mums that have computer issues, you then would find forums and blogs that attract this type of person such as baby sites, money saving sites, recipe sites etc and buy ad space or articles covering your service. These ads should take about the problems the person faces rather than a generic "we provide computer support" such as:

- computer is always slow
- computer keeps crashing
- cant install programmes
- printer doesn't work, etc.

Other people will tell you to first define your target market, then craft a marketing message that will address their needs. I have been hearing this for the last 10 years. To tell you frankly, this doesn't work. Why?

Perception = Motivation.

Here's an example.

Let's say you won a million dollars in the lottery today. You want to buy a sports car. A really sexy sports car. Which brand would you choose? You'd probably go for a Ferrari or a Porsche. Why? You have a perception in your mind that these car brands are they kind that you are looking for.

How did you get this perception in your head? Did you see a tv ad last night from Ferrari? Was there a Porsche ad in the newspaper this morning? Most of the ads you see are from car brands that you are not in the market for.

Motivation: we move towards that which we think is good for us, and move away from that which we perceive is not good for us. You think a Ferrari is a sports car that you prefer because you think it will do you good. You moved away from the Toyotas and Fords because you think these are not going to be good for you.

To get more customers, first you define your niche in their mind -- your brand. Why you are different from everyone else, and why people should choose yours. Customer support --This market is saturated with me-too providers. Differentiate your brand from everyone else. Soon as you have your own brand of customer service, generate buzz. How?

Instead of spending money on advertising or marketing, use that fund to interact with your target market and reward them with a positive experience. Use publicity to your advantage.
