What does this domain name tells you? what is your first impression when you read it?

**http://startupforward.com**

If you have a minute, just answer with the first thing that comes to your mind when you read the domain name, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks!

It tells me nothing. What actually happens is I see the domain name, it makes no sense, then I think about it for a few seconds. It still makes no sense, so I just move on.

Emptying my mind... looking at domain name... okay, first thoughts:

"Hmm, not totally sure. Must have something to do with startups for sure. What's the 'forward' mean? Is this a site to help startups... move forward? Perhaps a source of startup advice? To accelerate them, whatever that might mean? Or... to sell them? To push them forward to someone else? Nah, can't be that. Maybe it's got something to do with helping startups move forward."

Straight stream of consciousness, take it for what it's worth :-)

P.S. If I had seen this name on an ad, without a prompt to guess what it was, I would be more confused. The initial confusion would have stopped me from trying to figure it out; I would have just walked away and dismissed it as an odd name - unless there was a tagline or descriptive logo that offered more context.

My $0.02.

Seems like a tough crowd here. I like the name, sounds to me like a startup consultancy or seed stage advisor or something. Much of what goes into the domain/company name depends on what kind of company it is. 

I like domains that use real words (ie not sploink.com or something), esp if its some form of BtoB business.

I agree to most of the comments. It is something like going forward with the startup company... Or a helping hand to proceed with your idea. But it took some time to figure that out and I think you should look for an alternative name. Bit more smooth one.

Thanks and all the best.

Range of thoughts.

* Activist site (forward for some reason gives me the feeling of activist)
* Resource on startups or a site trying to sell something to startups (though it doesn't communicate as to what)
* A site about starting over, a how to do self improvement site.

Don't really feel real strong about the domain one way or the other.

putting startups first, or moving them forward. Doesn't seem to flow that well :(

Something for startups.

Problem for me is it's clumsy to say so that's a negative for me. And if that's the company name, that would be an issue too.

doesn't "roll", not catchy. probably because its 4 syllables, with the emphasis on 1st and 3rd. START-up-FOR-ward ....

It helps getting startups to advance their business/ go forward?

Have to be honest, it took awhile.

Moving startups forward - makes the most sense.  Unfortunately, it is long and not very intuitive.

Hmmm - Startupfoward.  What are you forwarding to startups?  Are you moving forward with a startup?  I think the domain would be good for keywords.  

I think that short, memorable nonsense words (or combinations) are better choices.  Find a latin word that describes an attribute of your business and try that one. Twiddle a few letters around.  Drop one (flickr, perhaps) and maybe you'll have something.

Confusing...doesn't connect to any specific mindset.

Right off, I would say no good.
Tell us the concept and I am sure we can give you some options.

I agree to all above comments. Your domain name [start up forward] does not include any potential keyword.
