## Is John Jonas (of ReplaceMyself.com, outsourcing "guru") legit or just a smarmy marketing guy?

I've read a bit of John Jonas's stuff. He's got some really polished marketing but it's compelling: using outsourcing effectively.

Has anyone had direct experience with his advice, consulting, etc.?
Does he provide honest, useful advice?

I hvae read in Software Without Borders that Philippine workers are well educated, speak English well, and that the one downside is a lack of good project managers (all consistent with what Jonas says).

I've seen John's system and I can honestly say that it does work. Outsourcing your business can help make your life easier, HOWEVER, it does take a lot of work at the beginning.

A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that once they outsource their business, they can simply forget about it. It doesn't work that way. You have to invest time now to get more time in the future. You have to train your employees so you'll get the results that you want. And like any employer, you'll have to go through a lot of resumes before you find the person you want.

His system isn't a shortcut to success. It's more or less a step by step guide on how to outsource your business. It's a system for those who have a clear idea of how their business runs, how they want to run their business, and how they can achieve their specific business goals.
