I am still working on a one-pager to send out to prospects and I was wondering if anyone had good blog posts or specific examples of one pagers they have received recently?  In addition, what content do you think is necessary to have on a one-pager?

Thanks

I like the concept of a business narrative as kind of a one pager. If you search for "business narrative" it will come up with a lot of good examples. You can also do an executive summary but that might be a little too formal right now.

I do have a blog post on this but I won't post it here unless people are interested.
