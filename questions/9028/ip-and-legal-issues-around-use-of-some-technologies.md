PS: i am naive if not zero when it comes to what it means to start or run a startup. So, please bear my question.

i am very passionate to work on some of my ideas but i am always let down by the legal issues surrounding it.

lets take this simple example - 

some one calls on his/her mobile from a given place X and if i need to automatically provide a response *based* on the current location ( the way some of the smartphones work today - for eg: google search from andriod phone for pizza will give you the local pizzerias  )

how do i know if i am violating some terms here or not ? 

in general, if i want to use some concept that already exists in the market as a part of my idea how do i know if i am not violating any terms.


Thanks,

<p>You need an overview of intellectual property law.</p>

<p>You may find "Top Ten Intellectual Property Mistakes of Startup Entrepreneurs" on <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/downloads/" rel="nofollow">my blog's downloads page</a> helpful.</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. This post does not constitute legal advice</b></p>

<p>Like Dana mentioned, you should read-up on Patent and Intellectual Property laws. The USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) has a good series of <a href="http://uspto.gov/ip/global/patents/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">pages</a> where you can spend hours learning about various laws and treaties.</p>

<p>You can also search their patent database to see if your idea has already been registered. A quick search on "mobile search" turned up these <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;Query=%22mobile+search%22" rel="nofollow">results</a>.</p>

<p>Fair warning, the mobile arena is pretty cut-throat. There are a lot of big companies and deep-pocketed IP firms that will vigorously defend their IP if they feel like your idea comes close to their IP. It would be well worth the money to do a deep search of the patent database and seek out legal counsel that specializes in Intellectual Property law.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
