I'm trying to find out about startups who were successful in building a community around their product/market. I believe that you don't just build a product these days but you also need to build a community around it and cater to them. I'm trying to find out about successful scenarios who may have shared the reasons they were successful.

On a second note, which sort of ties into my first question (at least with regards to my startup www.TheRedPin.com), how can I find out where my target audience is. I am interested to find out about people looking for homes in Toronto, Canada and like to know where these people would be so I can target them and bring them under one umbrella in the community mentioned above.

Thank you in advance,

Rokham Fard

In response to your first question, and as a person experienced with web community planning & development, I'd like to advise you follow a few golden rules.

1. Entice people to join your website community. *(Whether this is through something like special offers on services, prizes, or just great information isn't that important. What is important is that you offer them something worth their time of signing up and joining.)*
2. Make the content on your website original and more importantly, useful.
3. Reward members of the community for actively participating and referring others to join. *(This website is a great example of "rewards" with badges / points.)*
4. Poll your community on ways to make it better, and listen to the feedback!
5. Be an active member in the community by helping new members and building report.

The real thing you're striving for in any community is "member loyalty" and a raging fan base. It's definitely worth taking some time, thinking about your target audience in depth and planning how to reach them. Trust me that this will pay off long term!

~~~

Regarding your second question, the first few things that come to find would be to contact some of the big named realtors / brokerages in the city and try and get them on board. A second idea, which would take a bit of work, would be to search for terms like, "Homes for sale in Toronto." Make a note of who comes up first on Google and ask them where they get most of their hits from.

Hopefully some of this is of use to you - cheers,

You can use QuantCast.com , and alexa to qualify your site... I recommend quantcast, although you have to install a couple lines of javascript for it to really work .  

Web 2.0 is all about community involvement.  Include a blog, (update and write good content frequently)  Syndicate it with RSS and Email.  Send regular email newsletters.  Allow users to quickly register (open id, or fb login) and give incetives to comment.  Try to intergrate with FB.  I hate them, but cant avoid it.

I agree with Franky B, great advice. Also, do some research on blogs like http://www.managingcommunities.com/ - they often share case studies and tips on how to grow your community.

Building a community of potential real estate buyers may be a tough sell unless you can target investors who would probably buy more than just one or two homes in their lifetime. You might consider becoming an authority on everything and anything 'Toronto' and create a community around that - so when those members do decide to buy a home, you'll be 'top of mind' with them. IMHO
