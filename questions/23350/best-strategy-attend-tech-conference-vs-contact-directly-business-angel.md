We are working on a software product, in developement with v 1.0 not released yet, but with plenty of specifications for v 1.0 and for the next versions. 

Small technical team, low budget.

We're thinking about the best ways to make our idea public and get support  - financial support to be able to develop faster our product but also the business know-how.

Here's a summary of the 2 options we're thinking about:

1) participate to a software conference where are presented innovative projects, like ours.
This conference is in a few months from now, but the demo must be submitted earlier.
Issues we're thinking about:

1 a) when we first submit the demo and all our not-developed-yet ideas to this conference we would like to know nobody from the staff that validates our admision in this conference steals our idea. Should we ask for a privacy agreement? Is this an usual demand? 

1 b) When we present the project at the conference, the v 1.0 will already be finished and open to the public. Still, lots of ideas will remain undeveloped until then because there is not enough time for us to develop all.
At these conference we will get the community's feedback, some other company might propose to us a collaboration.
OR might someone steal our idea although our project is in v 1.0?

2) go and present the idea, with v 1.0, directly to some business angels companies. 
   Again, could they simply steal it?


Are these legitimate questions ?
What do you think it might be the best approach? What would you do?

Thanks

Go. Stop worrying. Build enthusiasm. Listen. Share. Take names. Follow-up.

You can't launch your startup and hide like a mouse afraid someone will take your idea.
There are tons of people you don't know who have great ideas overlapping in your space. 

What will allow *yours* to succeed is the way **you** implement. And to do that -- you need to share  it and tell people about it.
