My present [company](http://www.tagent.com) is a systems company that has to sell both hardware and software to business end customers. We are close to launching our product and I was wondering if the same Inbound Marketing rules that apply to software companies translate over to systems companies.

<p>I'd say so. You're still solving problems for someone, right? Just because the features / implementation are more complex for your type of company doesn't mean you're any less capable of producing content about the benefits you provide, the problems your customers have, and the other issues that they're dealing with.</p>

<p>The challenge with your company is that you're selling to many different industries, which makes creating one unified channel (like a blog) to publish your content on much more challenging. But inbound marketing isn't just about blogging. Creating a resources section for each of your most common use-case audiences is just as valid of a strategy. Creating infographics, white papers, articles, and how-tos will provide findable content that others working in / serving the industry will find it valuable to link to.</p>

<p>Though they're larger-scale, some good examples are:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/communities/" rel="nofollow">Adobe's Communities sections</a></li>
<li>Cisco's <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/communities/index.html" rel="nofollow">Communities</a> and <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/news" rel="nofollow">Blogs</a> sections</li>
</ul>
