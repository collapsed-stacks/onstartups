My last product, initially targeted at graphic designers, found a sweet spot with small business owners that struggled with FTP and who were looking for a drop-in replacement for their FTP server and file sharing needs. 

1. Are their more specific segments or verticals of FTP server users? 
2. How would you reach them?

<p>I think the better question is:</p>

<p>Who shares large files with people?  There's a group who deals with pain.  </p>

<p>(one to one) Take a look at <a href="http://www.yousendit.com/" rel="nofollow">yousendit.com</a> Sure, the title states FTP replacement, but I would bet that most people don't have an idea about what FTP is (my graphics designer didn't - but uses this service)</p>

<p>(one to many) - <a href="http://dropbox.com" rel="nofollow">dropbox.com</a> - easy file sync between geographically distributed people.  easy to use mac and PC clients. freeimum.</p>

<p>Now - what would the benefit of using your product be over these services?  What advanced feature set would these big file sharing types want that neither of the above support?</p>

<p>I would start with companies who <em>sell</em> FTP servers.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5FFTP%5Fserver%5Fsoftware" rel="nofollow">Here's a list</a>.  Simple FTP servers are free, so if you're selling FTP servers you're serving a market of people who <em>really</em> care about FTP.</p>

<p>Next question: Who are they selling to?  Answering that will take manual digging, but look at things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>What verticals and situations do they list under "solutions?"</li>
<li>Do they say something in "about us" which gives a hint?</li>
<li>Look at their news feed and see if there's a vertical or other pattern.</li>
<li>Look at their testimonials and see what people say and where they work.</li>
<li>Can you find their advertisements elsewhere?  Where do they advertise and what's the message?</li>
<li>Use a tool to list web pages which link to those companies -- what are <em>those</em> sites about and what is the message/context of that link?</li>
</ul>

Banks, insurance, travel industry.

I would say any business that handles very large databases and needs to transfer them.

Enterprise software support and customer-facing development teams need a tool like this -- every team I've worked with (at big companies as well as smaller companies) either uses an FTP server or a one-off solution for securely sharing files with customers. You might try to reach out to the Agile development community and users of web-based Helpdesk/CRM tools if your product integrates well with the needs of this user base.
