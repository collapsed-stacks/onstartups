How can i easily get a partner or funder on specified terms? I have been trying to download the list of venture capital investors for the past 3 months to no avail. Please help me locate the rightful personnel. Thank you

Venture Capital is probably not what you need. More likely you need a line of credit from your bank, or favourable credit terms from your suppliers. With either or both of these in place, you will be able to acquire the goods and sell them before you have to pay for them.

This is a standard way to do business, used around the world, although Zimbabwe is seen as less than optimum by some, due to corruption, currency manipulation and rampant inflation, so it may prove more difficult than other locations.

<p>In your case, VC funding isn't going to work.</p>

<p>I think that to get started, you should look into <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance" rel="nofollow">microfinance</a></strong>. There are many organizations out there that can help you start. Perhaps one of the best-known one is <a href="http://www.kiva.org/start" rel="nofollow">kiva.org</a>. Ironically, as I was looking at their homepage, the featured entrepreneur of the moment was looking to setup a shop to resell used cell phones in Lebanon so you might be in luck.</p>
