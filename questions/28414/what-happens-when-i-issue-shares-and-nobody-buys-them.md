After launching the prototype and getting some pretty exciting customer feedback over the last six weeks, we want to raise a little investment money.

We're talking with several organizations so far.  They all want to put in small amounts of cash.  So, how do I organize this?

Something like this would be ideal:

*  we pick a number of shares to issue  (say, 30% of the company)
*  we pick a share price
*  angels, FFFs, and early-stage VCs buy what they want.

How to do this?

What happens if we set aside say 30% of the company, and then only 25% sells?  Where does the remaining 5% go?

Nowhere. It is unsold. Everyone owns a bigger piece of a smaller financial pie. You can reoffer them for the existing investors to pick up.
