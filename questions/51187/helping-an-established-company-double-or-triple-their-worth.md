<p>Assume Bob is looking for a job. Bob has the skills to develop something that within a few months may possibly double or triple the worth of a well established company. The company is aware of this. Other than these skills, Bob is also valuable for day to day operations.</p>

<p>Bob is called for an interview with this company, company likes Bob, company makes an hourly offer.</p>

<p>What would be a professional way for Bob to negotiate a deal and bring to the company's attention that the value of the skill that may double or triple the net worth of their company, is far too valuable for the offer that was given.</p>

<p>Assuming they are still interested and would like Bob to propose a different compensation arrangement, assuming the company would agree to anything, what would be a the best for Bob to propose? (equity? monthly salary for an indefinite amount of time, after the fact that this skill has yielded good results? other?)</p>

<p>I apologize, my understanding of how business deals work is limited, I appreciate any suggestions.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p>The general principle is that there are two types of compensation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Salary: hourly pay is guaranteed, is based on market value, and is low risk. Bob will get paid his salary, whether he doubles the value of the company, or halves its value. Nobody can take his salary back if he fails: he has earned it, just by showing up.</p></li>
<li><p>Equity/Options: option or shareholders have no guarantee, are high risk compensation, and in private companies are part of an opaque market where value is what you can negotiate. Shareholders may work for six months, and have their options or shares be worth less than when they started.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Because we have a general societal preference that it's not fair for people to work and lose money in return, generally people work for the low risk hourly pay.</p>

<p>People who are supremely confident in their abilities will tend to negotiate pay packages where their hourly pay is much less than their market value (e.g., pay me $10/hr rather than $40/hr) and make up the balance with options or shares. That's what you will want to do. Your success at this negotiation will depend if the owners believe in sharing stock or not. If you were my employee, I would definitely be open to this proposal.</p>

<p>Your other option is to take your skills to your own company, where if you double your value, you get all the benefit (split with your co-founders).</p>

<p>Well if Bob's confident his value is in doubling or even tripling a well-established company's valuation (woowowowowow!!) then <strong>Bob should get paid in stock!</strong> Instead of an hourly pay he should get a loan to float him for 6 months.</p>
