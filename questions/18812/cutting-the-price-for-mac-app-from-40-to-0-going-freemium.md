I'm selling a Mac application for $40 and thinking about to go freemium. For now is just a mac app and I'm going to build a web service with an api, native cloud sync + win client + web app = something like Evernote, but a little bit different niche.

My question is:

 - Do you have any experience cutting
   the price for software from price
   range of 20-40USD to $0? If yes,
   please describe your experience, else
   tell me what you think about it. 
 - How to deal with customers who bought app
   before?
 - How likely they will request
   refunds?

I'm going to give a free premium subscription for 3-6 months. Is it a good compensation?
Also I'm going to write a blog post a month before shift telling about plans to make it free and about free premium subscription for all of the customers.

Why blog about it in advance?  All it can do is drive your sales to zero with no upside, as best I can tell.
