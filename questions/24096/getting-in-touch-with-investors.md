I am ready to get in touch with investors, what do you guys do. 

1) Do you send them an email with your executive summary?

2) Send them an email asking if they would like to receive one first?

3) Call someone in the company?

Do some research on your potential investors first.

Check that they invest in companies in your sector and around the dollar amount you are looking for.

Then find someone you both know that can give you an introduction.

Then start talking

Try seeing if you are connected to them through LinkedIn in anyway. I just found out yesterday some of the biggest local angels I have connections through people I work with right now. 

Blind-fire e-mails will generate a very low success rate.

<p>It depends if you are looking for just money or for the value investors may add.</p>

<p>If you just need money, then <a href="http://angel.co/" rel="nofollow">Angel list</a>, <a href="http://openangelforum.com/" rel="nofollow">Open Angel Forum</a> or even local startup/investors <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" rel="nofollow">meetups</a> can work.</p>

<p>If you are looking for <strong>value add</strong>, then you have to target who you are after. Figure out who can help you most, then you want the strongest connection you can get in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Personal introduction by another trusted investor or their portfolio company</p></li>
<li><p>Email introduction by another investor or their portfolio company</p></li>
<li><p>Cold personal approach to the investor</p></li>
<li><p>Cold email to the investor</p></li>
</ol>

<p>General:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do homework on the contact, know more about them than they expect. It will show that you are prepared. </li>
</ul>

<p>When meeting in person:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go against the flow - don't approach like most people, not after conference, maybe at an after party etc.</li>
<li>Your goal is to get an ok for further communication, be short.</li>
</ul>

<p>When sending emails:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear Short Thoughts</li>
<li>Problem, Solution, Results So Far</li>
<li>How that investor specifically can help</li>
</ul>
