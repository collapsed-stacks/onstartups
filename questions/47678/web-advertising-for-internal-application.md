I have a website with non-public pages. I would like to use advertisements on these internal pages. Is there an advertising network that allows this? For the life of me, I can't find one. For instance, Google AdWords requires either a login (which I don't want them to get). I will not advertise questionable material (ie Porn).

Does anyone know of an adveristing service that addresses this kind of scenario? The best that I could come up with was affiliate advertisements.

Advert companies like AdWords tend to rely on contextual advertising i.e the advert shown to user is relevant to the content its being displayed around. The problem comes if the advertising company can't see the content they can't pick an advert to show the end user. 

In addition most have strict rules on placement of their adverts, number of ads being displayed etc. The problem is behind a wall they can't see if you are following the rules and it's simpler to say no then to trust you.

While you will have to do some research you are probably better of looking at the smaller display networks which may have less stringent rules or networks where the advertisers rather then the network decide where ads are shown.

That said I do think ultimately you may have more success with affiliate marketing not least because you will be better able to tailor the adverts to the content but also because most affiliate programs will not mind seeing traffic from behind a walled garden.

Setup openX on a server and enable the market plugin, then people can advertise on your internal application via your openX server or you can load your own advertisers using the openX control panel.
