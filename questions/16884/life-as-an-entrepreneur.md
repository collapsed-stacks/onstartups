Just wondering, do you sometimes feel like you might be crazy? or is it normal to feel crazy as an Entrepreneur, because you are doing something different , that isn't following the normal path of life. ie 

Go to university/college, graduate, get a good job, work 9-5 for 5 days a week, climb the ladder, earn a maximum salary of $200k per year, get married, have kids, then die!

I bet my entire life on a single project, and im doing all this for what I love, I dont want a 9-5 job to do the things I hate everyday! what is the point of living, if im just going to do things I hate everyday? I rather live my life doing the things I LOVE every single day for the rest of my entire life! 

..and all this is for my passion :) 

p.s In the progress I lost my girl friend, I dropped out of university, I lost a 6 figures of my own money and have about close to nothing in my bank account! someone please wish me goodluck, im about to launch my product :) excited but very nervous at the same time!

"I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor, dumb bastard die for his country."

You have to focus on winning, less on self reflection.

It always gets hard before it gets better.  If it were easy everyone would do it.  I am truely inspired to hear you have made the sacrafices to back up your vision.

What i always tell people is that if you open your own lawn mowing business or hot dog stand chances are, when you do the math for time and money spent on an education that you will end up making more working for yourself.

You do need some money to make money, but not much.
And the money really isnt all that great, its just a great way to measure your success.

I have been at the bottom.  Nothing feels better than going from ZERO to HERO.  You will do it if you dont quit.  And if you fail, still dont quit.  You will get it right.

The bottom line, nothing is as rewarding as the test you go through while you go from being an ordinary bug to a butterfly.


And a sidenote about your girlfriend.  If you lost her because she doesnt believe in you, then its a good thing.  Women come and go.  Finding a girl that will back you up and support you is very rare.  once you have the $$ that comes with success there will be many voltures around, from companies who want to use you, to friends, to girls.  Make sure you learn early how to value friendships, and put yourself in others shoes (for good and bad)

BEST OF LUCK!!!!
I MEAN IT...

RIP THE BUSINESS WORLD A NEW SHINY HOLE!

If you did everything right before the launch (market evaluation, customer interaction, beta tests, etc) then you should not be nervous, you should  be prepared to see money coming to your bank account :)
Good luck!
