<p>I would say the one area you don't want to skimp on is the sales team.  In a lot of cases closed deals is a function of the number of contacts you can make.  The way to make those contacts is through a sales team.</p>

<p>One idea we've had good success with is having a couple of low paid cold callers do the initial call to setup a demo.  Once that is done an actual sales person takes over and marshals the deal to the point of close or no dice.  It cuts down on the actual number of "sales" people you need while letting them focus on what they do best.</p>
