I haven't been there in a while but this site has been set up for this: http://www.partnerup.com/

I have also set up a new business networking site recently - and it is going really well, where people share their "brain power" - it is at http://VirtualBrainTrust.org.   

I would be interested in learning about other sites that are good for this also.
