How should I approach selling a niche product or service to a large company? Do I use the "contact form" on their website? Do I call and ask to speak to a business team or salesperson?

I'm my experience both the methods you mention lead to poor results.

The best way is to be introduced personally to a person working in the large company. Look through your linkedin/facebook contacts, find somebody who is in any way connected to the company, and ask him/her to introduce you.

They will probably introduce you to a person who is not the 'economic buyer', but that is your first connection into the company. Give him/her a presentation of your service, and ask to introduce you to his/her boss.. and so forth until you reach somebody who can make the purchase decision.

Good luck! Sales in large companies take a lot of time and effort.

<p>This was covered in question <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/16384/how-to-find-the-right-person-to-speak-to-at-a-company/16409#16409">16384</a> here on Startups. </p>

<p>To summarize you start with a live contact inside the company. You need a real live person, not email or a contact form. You use that contact to find a better contact (since your initial contact will most probably not be the right contact for the job).</p>

<p>You work your way through people at the company until you find someone with the actual <strong>power</strong> to recommend your product or buy it.</p>
