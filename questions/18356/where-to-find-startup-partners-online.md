Does anyone know a good website where I can find partners for website or design projects? I'm not referring to job boards or forums.

Meetup.com is a good place to find co-founders and people with like interests. The one that's particularly good for Silicon Valley is Co-Founders Meetup.

You can also look at some of the freelance sites (like elance.com) to see if someone fits your profile.
