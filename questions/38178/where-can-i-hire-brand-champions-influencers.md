I read that you can hire ordinary people to go out and spread the word about a brand, although they don't exactly tell the friends that they're evangelising to that they're on payroll!

Does anyone know what this marketing technique is called and if there are any agencies that specialise in it?

Any time your marketing plan involves deceit I think you should rethink it.  

Building trust and likability for your brand is more important than the "quick hits" you might get from this tactic.

I think integrity and profit aren't mutually exclusive, in fact they usually go hand in hand.

I know I didn't answer your question, but really I would rethink that approach.  If you have something that's good, people will evangelise your brand honestly and without pay.
