My company is a U.S. C-Corp and we have recently created a stock option plan that allows for both ISO and NSO option grants. We have a foreign contractor located in China who does work for the company and we would like to issue her a number of NSOs. Is there any problem with issuing NSOs to a foreign contractor?

<p>Issuing alone is not a problem, but there are tax complications involved. Your corporation is required to withhold on the employee's stock option compensation upon exercise depending on whether your company is "engaged in trade or business within the United States" (ETBUS), which it presumably is. </p>

<p>Employers generally withhold on portion of spread allocable to ETBUS (Rev. Rul. 69-118 and ยง864(c). The spread is measured from grant date to exercise date. When it is unclear whether this sourcing is correct (as compensation may be for periods prior to grant), you may have to withold the entire amount and have the shareholder file for a refund from the IRS.</p>

<p>Also note that <a href="http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/01/19/what-is-section-409a/" rel="nofollow">IRC Section 409A</a> may be applicable and complicate witholding.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, non-resident aliens who receive compensatory income from the
  exercise of United States stock options are taxable, at graduated
  rates, to the extent that the income is attributable to services
  provided in the United States. This look-back rule applies regardless
  of whether the non-resident alien was a former resident of the United
  States - at least, that is the IRS's position. The look-back rule does
  not retroactively subject former residents to tax on their worldwide
  income.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><strong></em> Withholding under Section 1441</strong> Non-statutory stock options** </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An employer whose employee exercises a non-statutory stock option
  withholds under Section 3402. The employer need not withhold under
  Section 1441, because the regulations exclude from Section 1441
  withholding any ETBUS income subject to withholding under Section
  3402.(36) Withholding on a non-resident alien's wage income is nonetheless more complicated than withholding on the wage income of a
  US citizen or resident. Theoretically, the employer should withhold
  only on US source compensation, but an employer which must withhold
  from non-resident alien employees may not know how much of the
  employees' income is attributable to US sources. Employers may not
  always track their employee's US and non-US business days in each pay
  period. Regulations applicable to Section 1441 withholding provide
  that when a payer "does not know at the time of payment the amount
  that is subject to withholding because the determination of the source
  of the income" depends on unknown facts, <strong>the employer must withhold on
  the entire amount</strong>.(37) This rule is generally applicable to wage
  withholding as well. Thus, an employer facing this conundrum is
  permitted to withhold on the entire amount, leaving the non-resident
  alien employee to claim a refund.(38)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Capital gains</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, capital gain from the sale of securities by a non-resident
  alien is foreign source income;(43) as such, it is not taxable to a
  non-resident alien as either "fixed and determinable" income under
  Section 871(a) or ETBUS income under Section 871(b). Therefore, if the
  non-resident alien realizes capital gain by selling the stock
  underlying the option (as opposed to income from the exercise of the
  option), the capital gain is foreign source income and non-taxable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're feeling light-headed as result of reading this, then it's probably time to consult a tax lawyer.
