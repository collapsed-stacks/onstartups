I am from India - Bombay and have started this trading business of Cast Iron Brackets which is used to fix up wall hung commodes in bathroom/toilets, urinal commodes and wash basins alike.

It's been 6 months now and it has grown from Rs.15K (US $329) sale in the 1st month to almost Rs.3lacs (US $6,578) in its 6th month.

I started this business with literally "0" investment and now since it has grown and is growing leaps & bounds I am planning to manufacture these products on my own and it requires capital of around INR 4 to 5 lacs (US $88,000 to $110,000). 

My credit record is spoiled and I am in no position to receive any sort financial assistance from any of the Financing institutes and neither my family is in position to help me with such amount due to certain unavoidable circumstances.

However, I've been approached by a couple of my cousins, and they are ready to invest but only if they are getting a reasonable share in the business.

Is there any other way to
    raise capital where I don't have to
    share my business?

It sounds like your business is going well; 2000% growth in 6 months is impressive (are the numbers you provided for sales each month, or total sales across 6 months)?

Some funding suggestions:

**Building Up Loans (and Credit)**

Even if your credit is poor, many banks may be willing to provide you at least a small loan based on your business's performance. You'll need to rebuild your credit at some point, so why not start by asking for a smaller loan, expand your business as much as you can with that, pay it back as quickly as possible, and get a larger loan the second time?

**Discount for Up-front Payment**

If you have a large number of satisfied customers willing to be references for you, you could offer new customers a discount in return for up-front payment. So long as you have fixed costs, this would allow you to keep growing without taking outside investment.

You do have a couple of options to present to your potential investors. One is to offer a share in the company. How much you convince your benefactors to accept is partly a component of your negotiation skills. Remember, they may not see a single cent in returns if things don't go the way you hope they will. A typical first round with venture capitalists can mean giving up around 30% of your company. Sometimes it's more but, again, it depends on what (and with whom) your options for funding exist. Considering the gap between your current revenue and your ask, you may be looking at a higher shareholding for your investors than you may like. 

You can also issues shares based on a convertible note. In this scenario, you get the money, the investors get a corresponding number of shares based on the valuation of the company and at some date certain in the future, the investors can receive the cash back with interest or be entitled to more shares. 

Be sure that you understand your local laws on the issuance of securities before you sign any contracts.

Jay's answer is a good way to proceed. You have revenues and hopefully profit. I would save as much of the profit as possible, get a big customer to advance you for sales or try and work with your present manufacture to get the costs down. A big order from you will certainly drive down prices and allow you to save the profits.

Another option is to do a joint venture with another manufacture that wants to compete with your present supplier. That way, you get the money, give up some equity state but also have a partner that can produce for you.

If you want to pursue investment, then Sharon's answer on convertibles notes makes sense. You want to delay as long as possible doing setting a stock price until you have built value. Having a convertible note allows you to take the money and delay that evaluation until a later round.
