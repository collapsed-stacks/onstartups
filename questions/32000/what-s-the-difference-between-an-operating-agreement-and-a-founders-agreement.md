I am part of an LLC and have heard a lot about operating agreements and founders' agreements. What are the differences between the two for an LLC?

<p>The operating agreement is a document, usually drafted upon formation, that basically includes all topics covered by a so-called "founders agreement": restrictions to transfer of ownership, profit splitting, what happens if the company needs money, etc.</p>

<p>The founders' agreement, for an LLC, is like the termsheet of the operating agreement. A shorter, less technical agreement between the founders where they agree on the business terms ($$$ in particular) that will be further developed in the operating agreement.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://blog.simeonov.com/2010/02/22/startup-founder-agreements/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for more detailed info.

<p>This question was asked on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-a-LLC-operating-agreement-and-a-founders-agreement" rel="nofollow">Quora</a>, too. Here is the heart of the answer that I posted there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An operating agreement applies only to, and specifies the ownership and management of, an LLC.</p>
  
  <p>A founders' agreement can address whatever issues company founders want to document to establish a fair ownership and working relationship and to reduce the likelihood of misunderstanding or animosity down the road. It usually is thought of in the context of a corporation (addressing, for example, vesting, voting and restrictions on transfer of stock), but it could, conceivably, apply to an LLC, too.</p>
