I'm currently building a social networking site (as are droves of other startups) and I was looking for some experienced input on the legal issues that need to be taken into account. 

**Examples:**

 - A lot of sites take user posts/avatars and displays them in a feed on the homepage? 
 - What are the best practices to avoid any liability as far as company employees reviewing/using the user's private data? 
 - Is it worth working with another companies' API?
 - What are the legal barriers?

And so on. 

It'd be fantastic if some folks could thoroughly layout a primer of the legal issues facing entrepreneurs who are starting social networking sites, or at least pinpoint other items that raised headaches for you.

Thanks!

I'm doing what every one else is doing.

Legal issues are many but to put it as simple as possible you need Insurance.

 - Professional Indemnity
 - Public Liablity

The 1st covers data loss, copy right infringements, server down time, security issues (hacked mmbrs account) and some other things

The 2nd is really just an *add on* if your just starting the 1st is important. the latter can be put in place if you think the site is making a decent wage. The latter is more about if some one is harmed in anyway by using your site...e.g. a member loses a house due to you advising him that another member is good to pay for it but rippps the other guy off) This policy is not clear cut and designed to be highly understandable nor really something that is needed *immediately*

The 1st Policy is a MUST. You could get away with it for a wee while, but watch out if all your members get angry because your servers went bust and you lost alot of personal information.

Average qoute for Professional Indemnity is $700 - $1,000 per year.

Good luck

ASK A LAWYER. THis is true for most legal question, but if you ask for a CANINICAL answer, then thisis 100 times as true. Voting to close.

the common practice is that NOT everyone in the company has access to users data, but ONLY those admins that REALLY NEED TO ACCESS IT for one reason or another (this also means that there is no general DIRECT access to the database itself, but rather only through the admin interface).

--

as for the worht of working with other company's api, if you are making a SOCIAL site - it is a must. even Facebook works with other companies' API's (such as twitter for example).

-- 

one more issue is with specific personal / financial data - in certain jurisdictions it is NOT allowed to house or transfer it across borders, but this only applies to such info as telecommunication services used and financial data (there are other examples, surely).

--

there are laws, also about communicating via email, snail-mail, telephone, etc... with your customers so you need to abide by those as well.

--

another issue is the protection of personal information and how it must be stored, accessed and shared.
