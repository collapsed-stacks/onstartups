I've been aggregating a list of angel investors in the Boston area and I'm up to 180 or so now from around the area. The list includes links to Twitter pages, LinkedIn pages, and their investing groups (if they are part of one). Is that something that could be shared, or would it it annoy anyone? The lists are all public info, just that I've worked and aggregated. I don't mind sharing it but I dont want to piss the people I need $$ from off ! 

EDIT: I'm still building the list but here is a twitter list you can follow for now. -- https://twitter.com/#!/totaltab/boston-investors

By all means share this information. In fact, why not create a publicly shared google doc that others can add to?

If it's all public information, I don't see the harm? 

Entrepreneurs are still going to need to hustle to get introductions to the people on your list. The only thing I would be hesitant about is sharing emails (which I assume you don't have and aren't public).

I'm currently doing a round and had to make my own list (through info on AngelList) and it was a pain. Something like what you're proposing would have really helped!

Why don't you ask the people you have if it is ok.  Or tell them you will publish it and they have to contact you if they decline.  I think that is a lot more professional than just aggregating all those names, etc.
