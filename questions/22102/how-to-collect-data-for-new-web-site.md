I am about to start a question/answers site related to different topics. I have data collected from downloads/online article/people etc.

But i am not sure 
Is it legal to extract question/small description question from collected data and show it on website as question/answer form. 

Here is a question sample
How to make margarita?

Many sites has answer for this in form of article/books, I will just take part of it and show as a answer. 


Do i need to take any legal permission from data owner like novelist/siteowners/etc.?

Yes, you have to ask for permission, and I doubt you will not receive in most cases.

As far as I'm concerned, yes, you should attribute sources. But this sounds like one to check with a lawyer.

If you show just a part as preview and link back to the original content's location on the web, this will probably hold against a lawsuit based on a precedent set by Google.


So you'll have something like

*Note: I am not a lawyer and you should not treat this as legal advice.
