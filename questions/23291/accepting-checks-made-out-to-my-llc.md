I've just started a new LLC in Wisconsin. I've done some Googling and I found out that I need to fill out "some forms" and give the bank some "notifications" before I can accept checks made out to my LLC. Can anyone elaborate on this?

You just need to get an EIN number and open a bank account for the LLC.  You should NOT put LLC money into your personal account as this pierces the corporate veil and removes the LLC liability protections.
