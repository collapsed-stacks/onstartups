So, you know that on average for every unique visitor to a product page company X makes $0.11 (= total sales revenue /total unique visitors), and say the product price is $39.
Then I know that every 354 unique visitors X makes a product sale, but how do I answer the question: "out of 100 unique visitors how many buy the product?"

I'm not even sure what equation I should use. Is the answer 100/354/100 ~ 0.0028?

Divide total sales revenue by $39 to get the total # sales.
Then solve for x:

    total unique visitors     total # sales
    ---------------------  =  --------------
    100 unique visitors          x sales
