I have a coupon website and I have approached a few online stores and offline stores to partner with them to offer their coupons.

Very often I get this answer from them "coupons are unsustainable. we will lose money if we offer coupons. we are a premium brand and don't want to get into coupons.  how exactly do I overcome this problem and convince them to get on board?  - any suggestions?

Coupons are great for businesses just starting out, in order to spread awareness about their products and services. However, they're not feasible on the longer term, because they usually involve selling at a big discount, and where most of the remaining profits go to the coupon company. Businesses do not make much profit out of coupon-based offers.

As for premium brands, coupons will make them look cheap, I agree. Imagine Ferrari selling cars for 50% discount. I assure you all of their customers will jump to their competitors right away. When a brands are targeting the higher-end market, they don't want to be associated with lower-level practices.

I guess you need to find a way to make coupons sustainable for the businesses using them. Ask them why they think coupons will make them lose money, and find a way to modify your offerings. You also need to target businesses interested in using coupons, which are mainly new businesses with a high repeat rate, or businesses looking to expand to new markets.
