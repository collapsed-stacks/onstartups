Is there a formal distinction between the term "early stage" funding and other "early" funding such as seed funding, angel funding and venture funding?

<p>No, none of those types of words or categories are formally defined.</p>

<p>In fact, even just one of those terms can mean many things.  Take "angel" for example.  I had a guest-post on VentureBeat about <a href="http://entrepreneur.venturebeat.com/2009/11/04/4-ways-to-get-automatically-rejected-by-an-angel-investor/" rel="nofollow">how to get angel investing</a>, and from the comments therein you could take away these differences of opinion:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Angel" means "Raise under $50k and bootstrap from there."</li>
<li>"Angel" means "Raise under $100k and later possibly raise an A-round."</li>
<li>"Angel" means "Raise $300k with an option for another $300k, with the intent to never raise a real VC round."</li>
<li>"Angel" means raising money from friends and family.</li>
<li>"Angel" means raising money from accredited investors who should also be company advisers.</li>
<li>"Angel" means investing in (relatively) lower risk, lower return companies.</li>
<li>"Angel" means investing in high-risk, high-return companies.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do the same for any of these terms.</p>

<p>Bottom line: <strong>Decide what makes sense for you, and go for that.</strong>  Be able to explain what you want in one sentence, then nomenclature doesn't matter.</p>
