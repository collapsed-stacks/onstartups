## Can I have two different websites using the same PayPal account?

I have one site up that is struggling to find a MVP and getting dangerously close to running out of cash.

I have PayPal set up under that entity.  However, now, I'd like to create a separate website in a completely different industry, but I'd like the cash generated from that new site to flow into the same company.

Much like 37signals does it, why can't I have separate sites flowing into the same company?  I don't see why I have to create any new legal filings or separate administrative costs like legal and accounting.  

Anyone have any thoughts or advice on whether I can do this?

I read here http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/13828/a-question-about-how-to-handle-one-company-that-does-two-different-things but it didn't give a conclusive answer.

Thanks!!!

PayPal does not care which site is referring users to it. If you use something like a "donate" button, all the PayPal code has is a unique payee code, where to forward donated funds. You can put this button and as many sites as you like. PayPal even provides you with a separate code to include the link into emails.

Ah, stupid questions:

> close to running out of cash.

How can a SITE run out of cash? A business, yes, espeically a legal entity. But a SITE is putely a domain attached to a qweb server. No bank account etc.

> Much like 37signals does it, why can't

Ok, now it is not a SITE but a legal entity (i.e. some sort of corporation). How is that related? A corporation can own multiple sites etc.

I have a paypal account for accepting credit cards and it is not linked to ANY site, just my business.

Wehere did you even get the idea you ahd to file for the first site?

Sorry if that all sounds stupid, but at the same itme I totally fail to see what you actually mean. Sites are not a busieness. They can not own an account, have a paypal registration or run out of cash.

Not only can you use a given PayPal account for multiple activities (websites owned) by a given company - that is what PayPal apparently wants you to do.

Section 2.2 of the PayPal User Agreement (http://dana.sh/dESW4N) says that "You may only hold one Personal Account and either one Premier or one Business Account."

You can definitely use the same paypal account. What I'd recommend is that you create one paypal account and give it the name of your business, E.g 'Mister E Software LLC', and then you can use the same paypal account on all of your websites.

<p>From an accounting standpoint, mixing finances from two businesses is a bad idea. I would advise against it as you may cause accounting and potentially legal problems.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>My CPA has advised me to avoid mixing funds from my main business with my personal or other business finances. Here is what a tax lawyer and the IRS have to say:</p>
