## Are there any startup incubators or similar resources for a not-for-profit project?

I have an idea for a project that's not-for-profit (**not** necessarily non-profit) and I'm looking for something between a grant and start-up incubator — somewhere where I can get feedback on the idea on building the site from someone who is not a tech nerd.  Financial assistance is great, but not necessary (I'm able to self fund for a while), I'm really looking for formal opportunities to get mentorship.

The catch — I do not want to monetize via ads or charges for the service, I am not flexible on this. The way I understand start-up incubators is that they take a equity cut of the percentage of the company in return for the opportunity to work with business folks and people that can help get the business off the ground.  Is it safe to assume they won't be interested in such a project?   The other avenue to get money is via grant of some sort, but many grants provide only that, and though I'm confident in my own skills, I'm skeptical that I can pull it off without help.

The closest example to what I'm looking for is the [Code for America Accelerator][1], but my project isn't really geared towards government and it'd be hard to sell it as such.

Firstly, you've made an assumption that incubators aren't interested in NFPs. Validate that by asking some.

Secondly, given what you've stated, you're really looking for mentorship. Why not seek that instead? Directly looking for mentors will likely yield a more suitable mentor than just the ones that happen to be affiliated with the incubator which accepts you.
