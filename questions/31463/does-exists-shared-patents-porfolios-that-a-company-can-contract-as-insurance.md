considering so much articles I've read about the IP scenario today, I was wondering if there exists Patents holder companies that...

- Have a good patents porfolio (maybe thounsands, in many areas).
- Offer to  share their patent to little companys for a monthly/yearly fee.
- In exchange, if the customer (the little company) is IP sued, the Patent holder would contrattack with a sue based on their patents to nullify the initial sue or reach a deal.

So, in other words it would be like a insurance in the IP world. 
Instead of spending time and money on lawyer, why not to pay a subscription to be helped if these kind of sues appears?

(I know, it sounds like contracting protection from Vito Corleone, but maybe that's better that someday be alone against some "Tattaglias")

1. I wouldn't even worry about this as a small startup. You are too small a fish.

2. Cost of litigation for such bogus patent claims is north of a million dollars, so any insurance premiums would have to be extremely high. There is also no guaranteed way to counter-sue a patent troll, so your basic concept of protection would most likely not even be possible.
