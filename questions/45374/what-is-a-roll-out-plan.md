What is a roll-out plan? I tried searching on Google, but without much success. I found http://www.project-open.org/en/tutorial_rollout_plan, but I still don't understand what a roll-out plan is for a startup. Does it have a synonym? 

Any examples (with images) are more than welcome.

<p>In startup terms, "<strong>Roll Out</strong>" generically equates to launch.. as in <strong><em>release a product for use outside of the company</em></strong>. </p>

<p>"Roll out" is used more frequently in corporate / enterprise circles - esp. where development and deployment costs are budgeted &amp; tracked independently.</p>

<p>Some project deployments are relatively simple (launching a blog, for example) - while others require migration of existing data, coordinated training, etc. Products that require complex setup tasks sometime refer to a "roll out plan" that details what is needed to use the product-- esp. when the cost to roll out the product exceeds the cost of the product itself (Think <a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP</a>).  </p>
