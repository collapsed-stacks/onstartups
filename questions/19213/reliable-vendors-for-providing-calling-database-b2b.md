We are launching a campaign where we are targeting small and medium sized businesses in major cities. We intend to do outbound calls to get in touch with these business owners/decision makers.

It will be great if you can share details of any reliable company/vendor who can provide us with database of these kind of companies. Like their name, contact person name, phone number (mobile/landline) and their email address.

Please also share your experience in case you have done something similar in the past then share the things that I should do and the things that should be avoided.

Thanks for your time.

infousa.com is where you can buy access to these db's.  I am sure they have intergrations with SugarCRM and SalesForce if you are using a CRM to track your work.  You can also look into outsourced call centers such as liveops.com if you really need to make a ton of calls.
