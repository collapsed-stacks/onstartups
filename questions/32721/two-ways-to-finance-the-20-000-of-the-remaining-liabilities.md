A business has $80,000 worth of liabilities that must be paid within the next 3 months. The liquid (can be turned into cash quickly) assets total only $60,000, the sales and collections from customers are slow. Please, help to find two ways to finance the remaining $20,000, so the business can pay all of the liabilities when they are due.

<p>Some ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have collections that are slow to come in, you can sell them to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_%28finance%29">factoring company</a> - which might be as easy as talking to your bank for a recommendation. </li>
<li>Also look at what costs you have. If you are spending more than you are making, you will remain in trouble. Cut out as many costs as possible, even if means a bit of short-term-pain for longer-term-survival.</li>
<li>Talk to the people you owe money to. It may be they are happy to wait a little longer if you organise payment plan with them and start to pay something now. The last thing they want is for you to default on the loan and they get nothing.</li>
<li>Finally, look for more funding. This should be a last resort. The typical places to look are: Banks, Friends, Family, (and fools).</li>
</ol>
