I'm working on a software application in a large company as consultant. I use a library released as Dual License Model (AGPL v3 and Commercial). 
Do I need to purchase a commercial license to use the library in the application **only** in the company?

If I later decide to sell the application to another company, I know I would need a commercial license, but not sure about internal use only.

Thanks

Why don't you ask the owner of the library? It is the best way to clear any licensing issues.
