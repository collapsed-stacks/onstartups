Why won't someone just build a decent, popular platform where people can find partners? *Sigh*

Partnerships in business can be tricky.  Most partnerships fail. Here are a few points to ponder before starting a partnership:

- Should have common goal and vision
- Level of commitment in business
- Expectations from business and each other.
- Good sense of self-worth
- Financial Position – Have a good experience in related business with strong financial standing

I suggest you to go on Google type “Partnership Assessment form” and Partnership Assessment Tool” You find some good results. Further try out social media and business opportunities sites like servana, you hopefully find good partner for your business.
