Hello OnStartUps Community,
 
I feel this is a great forum to get some opinions on my current situation, I hope to hear some ideas!

I plan on moving home in June to pursue my MBA and work at my family's company;  after recently being laid off from JP Morgan, I find myself in a unique situation that I want to take advantage of it.  I was suggested by one of my fellow Babson graduates that I contact local start ups and offer my short term services (6-8 months) in exchange for the unique experience.
 
This prospect excites me as I feel it is mutual benefit for all parties, including my father who will have me join his company with this valuable experience under my belt.  I am wondering if you think this is a good idea and how I should go about presenting myself.  I am already in contact with a VP at a start up called Gazelle. I realize that if this a valid idea then there are plenty of opportunities out there for me for this upcoming winter and fall.  

Thanks!
TS

Sounds great.  

The only thing I can add is to seek out a startup in a vertical that interests you.  In trade for your time you're going to get industry knowledge and contact, so make sure you can leverage them in the future by being in the right vertical.

Gazelle is a very cool concept and from what I've experienced with them could use your help.

We are a Boston-area startup that's planning our initial product launch Dec 1.  We have a single customer lined up and are going to make a run of it by bootstrapping.

I'd love to grab a cup of coffee (or a cold beer!) and chat.  You can contact me at rwilner (at) sagepointsoftware (dot) com.

Thanks, and good luck!

I'm working at a tech startup in mid-Mass that has been growing leaps and bounds,and I'm about to launch my first product as well. I'm home-based (for now!) but am always looking to connect with other like-minded people, even if not for business, just to get talking about opportunities, business, and so on. I have an MBA from Bentley where I concentrated actually in entrepreneurship. 

If you are interested even in just connecting and talking, I'd love to do that!

Sounds like something that both you and the start-up can benefit from...  You can gain valuable experience, and see if the path of the entrepreneur is the one you want to follow in the future without any real risk that is usually associated with starting your own business.  The start-up will gain access to your knowledge and abilities, which under normal circumstances they might not be able to afford by hiring someone with your experience.

Make the most of it

Good luck

TS - I'm a fellow Babson grad, running a start-up based out of Waltham. Let's meet up and see if you're a good fit for Textaurant. If not, I know plenty of other start-ups in the area who could be solid matches. josh [at] textaurant /dot- com.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

my 2 cents, seek opportunities that focus on developing specific expertise. My recommendation is to learn metrics marketing and customer acquisition techniques as expoused by Sean Ellis, Dave McClure, Andrew Chen and others.

If the goal is to gain skills and become marketable in the Boston area, you can't go wrong becoming a web product management expert. There is a lack of talent here locally. I think you will find a large demand for that function as web startups (including myself) find the really tough part is growing audience and not building the product.

You may find this enjoyable especially assuming your like numbers as coming from a quant background seens to be a good basis to move into metrics oriented product marketing.
