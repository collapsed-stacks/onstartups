I am interested in using a rotating banner on a home page. The presentation is like a slide show, with a series of text messages, each with a simple graphic related to the point of each message. Each slide pauses for 12-15 seconds or so and the content of each slide is a heading and one to three sentences. 

Does anyone have best practices for producing this type of content that they can recommend? Do's and don'ts? Or examples of web sites that really do a good (or bad) job of this type of thing?

Is this in general a good thing compared to static text, or is it distracting?

The main problem I am having is providing a series of talking points to a visitor without cluttering up the design or forcing them to read a lot of material. My intention is to give the visitor a reason to browse the site further or to click the contact link.

The reason I don't like this idea is that you will have to make assumptions about the reading speed of the visitor. If they read quickly, they will get bored quickly. Bored visitors leave. If they read slowly, they will be irritated. Irritated visitors leave.

Since people don't all read at the same speed, you can't win.

Many websites use these banners although slides switch every 3-4 seconds (not 12-15).
They are attractive to most users I believe IF they have a purpose, meaning they need to engage the users at some level. Don't do them just for the sake of it. People are more likely to watch your banners than to read a paragraph of text.

My suggestions would be:
-Make sure you emphasize your selling points/call to action(s)
-Keep them short and to the point
-I would keep it to 4/5 slides max
-Make them attractive (clean & simple)
-If you can afford it (or have one), also place a video in one of the slides. Most of the banner scripts out there allow you to do that.

If you are looking for some good scripts, I found mine on envato.com for a couple of dollars, but I'm sure there are many places where you can find good ones even for free.

Hope that helps!

Does it work for your target customer?
Does it work for your product?
Does it fit your purpose? 

The designer or developers personal appreciation or displeasure to a specific feature on your website is second to whether it makes sense for your market. 

Different demographics will have a different appreciation for (or tolerance of) motion on your site. The design needs to match the purpose with the targeted audience. 

I have found that rotating banners in a primary position on the landing page of a site become the focal point and make all other content secondary. Each picture should have an actionable step association with it. The action steps should be one that moves the sales proposition forward.
