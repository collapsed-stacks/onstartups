I've been talking to a VC backed startup for about a month or so.  Last week the CEO invited me to their corporate headquarters to meet the team.  Seems like a good sign that they are flying me out, but not really sure what to expect.

The company is based in Boston has about 30 employees and just received series B funding ($6mm) series A was in Jan of 2009 ($4mm). From what they tell me they are meeting their goals.  I was introduced to the company at an industry conference in NY back in March (met the VP of Marketing & she seemed great).  This would be the first startup I've worked for if I take the job.

I'm looking for advice for:

1. dealing with the executive team CEO, VP Marketing & Sales and VP Product Development (founder)
2. what is normal in terms of compensation (salary, bonus, stock options) when joining a startup at a director level in Boston
3. any questions that I definitely should ask
4. any topics I should avoid at this point in our relationship
5. any thoughts on Boston, seems like a great city...currently I live in the booming metropolis of Fort Smith, AR I know the cost of living is about 60% higher in Boston
6. what questions should I be prepared to answer that I might not think of
7. anything other advice that you could give me, my experiences are limited to working for large corporations

I'm looking forward to your advice.  

Thanks

A few comments - I think you are LOW on the cost of living difference.  30 people and a year and a half after series A no longer seems like a startup to me.  

I'd ask what their burn rate is and their revenue (if any) and what their goals are for the next month, 6 months, year, etc.  

Ask what they expect of you and why they are looking for a director of development.  

How many customers, what is the growth of the customer base and revenue, what risks they have and how they are meeting those/planning for them.

What other contingencies do they have if things don't go as hoped, etc.
