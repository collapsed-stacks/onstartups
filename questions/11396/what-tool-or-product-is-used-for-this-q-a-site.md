What tool (or product) is used for this Q & A site? I came across this tool on other sites and kind of like it. I am looking for a tool similar to this to implement for my website. Will appreciate useful answers. Thanks

The problem with stackExchange is that they are not making this available anymore and will control all the new knowledge bases that use it in the future. So not a good alternative for using on your site as I understand.

I am interested in finding a product like this for my site too, but haven't found anything yet. I'd also be grateful for any leads.
