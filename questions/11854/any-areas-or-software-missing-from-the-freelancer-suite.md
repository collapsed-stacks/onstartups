There are certain aspects of what I like to call the "Freelancer suite," basically tools that are designed specifically with the freelancer or small web team in mind. They basically are: time tracking, invoicing, collaborating, organization, etc.
Certainly some of these areas are very well-covered and considerably crowded spaces, particularly team and client collaborating and invoicing. I was wondering if any of you saw areas or niches that were being underserved or all together missed?

Great question. I've been able to find solutions for all of my needs one way or another, but one need I did not have fulfilled was in knowing which of all the available solutions was good.

In other words, I would love to see a ratings & review site for B2B tools such as these. A Yelp for freelancers, you could say. Lots of blogs & ezines review a niche of tools, but none aggregate them and allow users to submit feedback & discussions as well.

If anyone here ends up building such a service, let me know! I'd even love to help out in any way I could :-)

Excellent question! I see lot of customers (small businesses or freelancers) struggling to find appropriate suite of software that can handle their day to day operations without spending too much of money or resources. 

The tools that I can think of are categorized as Customer management - managing customer accounts and contacts, Project management - managing client projects as well as internal projects (could be internal product development too!), Time tracking, Document management, Customer support and Invoicing. There could be others too! 

We are trying to create a solution that covers all the aspects as mentioned above and keeping small business community and freelancers in mind. So far, we have released a beta product with CRM, Project Management, Time tracking, Document Management and Customer Support functionality. We also have Invoicing solution as work in progress. We are still in beta and are looking for customers like you who can help us shape the product. If you participate in the Beta program and give us feedback, we'll give you free subscription for a year!

You can find more information about our solution at www.appsoncloud.com. As we are still in beta, you might not find fancy video tours and detailed description on our website. Feel free to ask questions by sending an email to rj at appsoncloud.com.

Good luck!
