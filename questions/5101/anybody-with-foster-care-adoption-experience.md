I'm developing a foster care application for fostering and adoption agencies, and I'm about 35-40% complete.

I'm looking for someone who has experience of fostering agencies or organizations whose brain I can pick to improve my application.

I'm after help with what data to record, types of reports, etc. I already have quite a few screens that capture data, but I want to make sure that I cover areas that only experienced foster care workers would know.

Thanks,

So why don't you ask experienced foster care workers?

Better than asking here, no?  I'm sure you could find some near you.  Many foster care workers do their craft for the love of the job and the impact on society and on the children (who would do it for the money?).  In other words, they would happily volunteer their time to be a part of your project.

EDIT: Re-reading my answer I realize it may be a bit terse, please don't take offence.  It's just that I think that if you really want to ask foster care workers, then you should ask foster care workers.

I can't imagine even thinking about going into this market.  You will have insane amounts of compliance issues - you are dealing with records of minors who have some unusual circumstances and there is a LOT of legal interest in this area.

You'll need some good attorneys and some fantastic security and privacy policies for your data...
