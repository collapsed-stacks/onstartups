I have a New Zealand based company. I sell items online. I am setting up a new website in the states that customers will buy from. My supplier (in the US) will send directly to the customer (in the US). My server is based in Russia, and I have no physical business premises in the US. Everything is run from New Zealand, other than my supplier sending directly to the customer. Do I need a resellers permit for the US and do I need a DBA?  I will be paying income Tax in NZ.

No. If you do not have physical property in a given state you're not doing business there, and you don't need any kind of permit.
