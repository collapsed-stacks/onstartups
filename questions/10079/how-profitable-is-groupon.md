On the internet it says that groupon has been profitable since June 2009. Does anyone have a reasonable guess how much profit they make?

Given they raised $36 million recently I would imagine they are making alot of money - if valuation was based on future earnings. They take a cut from the coupon sales and given they sell a lot in different cities you could probably estimate turnover but profits would be tricky, their operating costs can't be that high as the major cost is probably marketing staff to find merchants. 

In the UK the group buying market is exploding, so if you're thinking about entering this market it will be tough. 

disclaimer: we developed a group buying site for likebees.com 

EDIT: now that they are raising yet another round at a 1+ billion valuation, I would like to think they are at least going to be profitable, otherwise we're in another bubble

Does it say it is profitable on their site? My understanding they are fairly new and VC funded. Doubt that they even broke even.

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/15/the-rest-of-the-details-on-that-monster-groupon-financing/" rel="nofollow">This link</a> says that they are clearing $1M a week, but there's absolutely no substantiation for the claim. It's from TechCrunch, so believe that (or not) depending on your religion and politics :-)</p>
