We've launched our group buying app (no, we're not a Groupon clone) for online retailers about 3 weeks ago. Traffic has been okay, and we have a fair number of sign-ups for the trial. We've only had 2 sales so far, despite our low price point.

I was wondering if you guys have any feedback on our app. How we can improve it, how we can better position it, what might make sense that we might have overlooked, etc.

Thanks a lot!

The application has been out only for 3 weeks, be patient. What is the conversion rate? how many unique visitors compared to the number of signups? for a product that has only been 3 weeks out there, you seem to be doing OK. 

I like the idea, the name and the look and feel of the application. If things aren't moving fast enough, keep making changes to the landing page until you get the desired conversion rate.

Note: There is a typo in the sign-up window... "iterally" I think is supposed to read "literally"

Good luck!
