I am looking to start a service business that has very low barriers to entry and I am concerned with competition.  Has anyone had a similar problem or concern? If so, what have you done to overcome this?

The majority of startup businesses have a low barrier to entry due to the nature of limited resources they have (unless you have a lot of capital to inject which are the exceptions). So don't feel alarmed that your idea/concept is relatively easy to replicate, most are. 

The areas you need to focus on are the ways you can differentiate:

- branding 
- customer service
- user experience

<p><strong>'Low barriers to entry' <em>brings about</em> 'brutal competition'. It's as simple as that.</strong></p>

<p>Food preparation is one of the classical examples. In most countries more or less anyone can open a fast food place or an restaurant with a minimum of formal training. So lots of people do, and prices are under constant pressure as a result.</p>

<p>"Be better than the competitors." <em>How</em> to do that as your question is presented, absent any constraints or specifics about the market, <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#questions">is impossible to answer here</a>.</p>
