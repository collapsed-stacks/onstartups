I want to start my own company that allows users to take surveys and get paid for doing so. My question is, how do I get these surveys from affiliates? What companies do I need to contact to supply me with surveys for my users to take and get paid for doing so. Thanks for the help!

<p>Even though this question is very old, I would still like to answer it in case anyone else comes across it.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly where to find what you're looking for, but here's a few places doing sorta the same thing:</p>

<p><a href="http://microworkers.com" rel="nofollow">microworkers.com</a> allows you to hire it's members to fill out (member posted) surveys and other "Micro" jobs. </p>

<p>You could also talk to the folks at <a href="http://www.surveyhead.com/" rel="nofollow">www.surveyhead.com</a>. Same idea as microworkers, but they seem to be <em>affiliated</em> with some bigger names.</p>

<p>Check out these places, maybe you can pick up a lead or two</p>
