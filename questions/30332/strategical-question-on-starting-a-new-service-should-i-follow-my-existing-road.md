I have a website where bloggers share their posts in it, so visitors will visit their blogs. It is local, with a quite good number of members that share about 300 posts per day.
Even though this number is steady, I lost a number of visitors because of 5 sec advertisements before showing a post.

Please let me not to share the name here, but let's say is `stack.nl` 
It was a new thing when I first launched it and the name of it is really a good one for my country. Like rewriting a word in your mother tongue correctly. All shared articles are saved in the database, with categories, users have their profiles, found through google etc.

I have created an application for auto-sharing, that a user can add their RSS feed and since then all their posts will synchronize automatically. It will have some kind of archive, no profiles, no google indexing, no categories, just a huge list of posts and news, but the good of this is that their will automatically updated with new posts. This is good for the visitor.

Now, I have some concerns:

 1. Should I replace the manual sharing with automatick, on `stack.nl` that worked really well on the past 2.5 years?

 2. If at the end create a new page for the automatic sharing, should I name it after my first site, like for example `stacker.nl` or a new name  `randomname.nl`? With `stacker.nl` people may know that this page is related with the `stack.nl`.

My opinion is that it is not bad to create a new. I guess this what I have to do. Bloggers will keep manual post to the `stack.nl` and just add their RSS in `stacker.nl` 

New page layout, different features, automatic and more posts, helps visitor to read posts/news at a glance and mobile edition.


Thank you for all of your answers, thoughts, ideas.

Instead of mandating automatic or manual sharing of posts, why not try an option where bloggers can "opt-in" to the automatic service or choose to control sharing manually. 

If you already have a strong base of users and visitors, I don't see a need to change the url unless the name change would somehow brand the service better.
