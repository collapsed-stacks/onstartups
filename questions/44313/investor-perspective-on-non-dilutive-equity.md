What is the investor perspective on non-dilutive equity? I am in a situation where the Founder of the business wants to offer me and other management non-dilutive equity (10% of total outstanding). While that is good for me/other management in the beginning, I am trying to figure Will it act as a deterrent for investors and reduce the valuation of our equity later. Appreciate if someone can offer some perspective here. Thanks!

How do you expect that to work? If you have 10% of the outstanding shares, what shares would an investor be buying? Does this mean the founder will be selling his shares to new investors, thereby holding the outstanding shares constant. Of course this means he is cashing out. Or do you expect to be given more shares?
