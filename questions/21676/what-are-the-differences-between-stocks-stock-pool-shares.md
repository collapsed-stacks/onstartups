Have read lots of different terms. I have no idea how they differ from one another.

Things like, 20% stock pool for employees, and 1 million stocks, etc.

Can someone enlighten me?

Thank you.

<p><strong>The "capital stock" is the capital the company was founded with. It is divided up on individual shares.</strong> You could have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock" rel="nofollow">found that on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>In day to day business speak it's common to use "shares" and "stocks" (note plural) as synonyms, i.e. they normally mean exactly the same.</p>

<p><strong>The "options pool" is a number of shares which are earmarked / reserved for future employees.</strong> In other words, it's a pool of shares that will be used for share options for employees, as an incentive on top of their salary.</p>

<p>The key things to know about the options pool are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You should give it the right size, by having a realistic and well thought out hiring plan.</p></li>
<li><p>That it is often expressed as <a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle" rel="nofollow">post-investment terms but it dilutes pre-investment shares</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above link to Venture Hacks, you should also see their <a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/cap-table" rel="nofollow">Excel spreadsheet for building a capitalization table</a>. In general, go read lots of Venture Hacks articles, they're great.</p>

<p>Shares are synonymous with stock in the sense that both represent % ownership of a company/companies.</p>

<p>To understand stock pools you will have to know the difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shares_authorized" rel="nofollow">authorized shares</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issued_shares" rel="nofollow">issued shares</a>, and the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_dilution" rel="nofollow">dilution</a>.</p>

<p>20% ownership pool for employees refers to the percentage of the company reserved for employees (assuming full dilution).</p>
