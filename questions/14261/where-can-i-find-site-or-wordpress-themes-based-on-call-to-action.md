I would like to find themes based on the call to action I need - for example, I need a theme with an email signup as the main call to action - any one know of a themes website?

Should I build one?  lol

***Note:  Some template websites charge as much as 50X for sites using the themes for software - see themeforest***

Check out Unbounce.com. Not Wordpress but super easy WYSIWYG landing pages. Easy to put CTAs on them

Found this:
