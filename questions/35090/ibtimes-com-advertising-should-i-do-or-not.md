I was "prospected" as one of the top ecommerce providers of 2012 by IBtimes.com  (yeah right). They said I could be a top listing if I paid them 5 K then I would get millions of users exposed to my stuff.

Is this BS? First of all, they are asking for paid advertising for their "best of 2012 ecommerce sites". That is hokey right? I was wondering if I should do it or not and any experiences you guys have with this type of thing would be useful. Unfortunately, the rich people I know don't tell me squat even though I'm not competing with them in the same industry so I need community advice. 

Thanks.

5k one time fee? a year? 5k a month? ... Typically if you are concerned about the return on investment you should setup a pay-per-click or pay-per-impression arrangement with them.  Like $5 CPM -  $5 for 1,000 impressions or something like that.
