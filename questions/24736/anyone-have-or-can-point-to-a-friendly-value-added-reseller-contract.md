I'm going to run a pilot with some value added resellers we don't have a long term relationship with.
These are small VARs with very low risk, so I don't want to shell out yet $$$ on my good attorney for a real agreement, since it will cost more than any money I may make on the pilot.

Anyone have a link to a friendly reseller agreement? One or two pager is what I need.

Thanks!

P.S. If the pilot works, I will be calling my guy. I am not that reckless.
