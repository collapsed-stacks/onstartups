Is it wise to keep a company that will no longer have any activity? and file zeroes on all its tax returns? Dissolving it might incur a higher one time cost. The company in question is a delaware c corp.

I'd do a present cost analysis and go with whatever is cheaper.  Unless there is a way to avoid whatever costs are associated with dissolution, sooner or later you're going to have to pay them.

If it "will no longer have any activity" then close it properly. There are always costs in keeping it going. If you miss a filing you will incur penalties. Besides, it will keep you distracted. And, eventually you will have to close it anyway.

It's better to dissolve the company if the point of the company will no longer be to make money. You can easily incur IRS penalty's if you're not making a good faith effort to make money.
