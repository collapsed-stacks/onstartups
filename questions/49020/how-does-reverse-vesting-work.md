How does reverse-vesting work? I understand the company has the right to "buy back" shares if the employee leaves early, but how exactly does that work? What price do they pay per share?

It depends on the terms of the stock purchase agreement - a common approach is to repurchase at the same price that the employee bought the stock for.
