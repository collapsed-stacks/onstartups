I'm not sure about my position on buying and selling webapps. This comes to mind due to the recent 250k sale of retweet.
What I'm thinking is about the practicality of it all: content sites and blogs are simple: anyone can take over.

But webapps deal with languages, and frameworks, and good or bad code.

What's your stance on buying and selling webapps in the short term?

You don't really buy the application, nor the customers. You buy a **business plan**. If your target application has none, you have to come up with one, otherwise the acquisition makes no sense (well, unless you want to get rid of a competitor).

It seems to sales of web apps these days are really a purchase of customers instead of the product.

I guess when cash is not an issue, that's a great way to acquire a market right without incurring time and market risk.
