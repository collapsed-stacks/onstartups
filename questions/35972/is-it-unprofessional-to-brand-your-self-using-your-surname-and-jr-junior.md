I would like to know your thoughts about my question/problem. I care a lot about online presence and I want to brand myself this period for some auditions and interviews.<br>My surname in my country is quite usual, so it is hard for me to have a presence on the internet where all my usernames are the same. In my opinion it is the best method to have the same username to every account you use.

<br>
I am trying to find the best and professional way to have the same username in all of my accounts (twitter, linkedin, skype, facebook e.t.c.).
<br>
I tried to use the first letter of my name with my surname like **nsurname** but I can't have it on all networks. My full name is big, some networks does not accept it.

The best method I thought is to build my online presence using **surname***jr* It is available on all networks and as a .com domain and I am the junior.

My second thought is to use as a .com domain my full name, 17 letters and have all my networks as **surname***jr*.

What is your opinion about my view?

The issue is not professionalism in my opinion but ease of brand recognition.  If your **surname** is your brand then drop the **JR** from it to register a domain.  Now if the *surname.com* is already registered I would come up with a different domain name and try that.

**JR** is not part of your **surname** but actually a qualification that there is another person with the same name.

I think when it comes to branding, consistency is key. I think you can use surnamejr to your advantage if you make a play with it on your site.

With services such as http://www.about.me it's becoming less important to be consistent, because it's easy to find the person and the services linked to them. That said, I do try to keep all of my accounts to my real name, or my handle: "clogish" where possible.
