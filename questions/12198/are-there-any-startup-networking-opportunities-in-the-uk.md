Are there any networking opportunities for startups (primarily internet entrepreneurs) in the UK - or more specifically, London?

Since we are mostly bootstrapping and therefore need to keep costs down, we are mostly interested in free events - or events that have a nominal fee. Also, for such events, (personally speaking), greater importance is attached to the opportunity of meeting similar minded entrepreneurs in the same stage or maybe a bit further up the growth curve, rather than the opportunity to meet 'vulture' (er sorry venture) capital firms.

<p>Have you tried <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" rel="nofollow">meetup.com</a>? Meetup.com helps groups of people with shared interests plan meetings and form offline clubs in local communities. These meetups are free.</p>

<p>I just did a search for small business in London, UK and found <a href="http://smallbiz.meetup.com/cities/gb/17/london/" rel="nofollow">122 meetup groups</a>. Doing a search for entrepreneurs in London, UK gave me <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=entrepreneurs&amp;userFreeform=London%2C+England%2C+United+Kingdom&amp;mcId=c1012717&amp;mcName=&amp;lat=&amp;lon=&amp;gcResults=&amp;op=search&amp;resetgeo=true&amp;events=&amp;submitButton=Search&amp;radius=25&amp;radiusSet=true" rel="nofollow">186 meetup groups</a>. It's worth checking out if you haven't.</p>

<p>There are lots of (mainly free or nominal entry fee) technology-based user groups, meetups and events. <a href="http://entrepreneur.meetup.com/cities/gb/17/london/" rel="nofollow">Meetup.com</a>'s a great way of hunting down groups.</p>

<p>I'd want to highlight <a href="http://www.meetup.com/londonocc/" rel="nofollow">London Open Coffee</a>, which meets Thursday mornings at UCL (near Euston Square) and primarily connects internet entrepreneurs in an informal and unstructured way.</p>

<p>Morpheous - presume you are aware of <strong><a href="http://network.businessofsoftware.org" rel="nofollow">http://network.businessofsoftware.org/</a></strong> which has a fairly strong UK bias.  Members organise informal dinners from time to time, either in London or Cambridge - I have been to one so far, which was both quite enjoyable and quite useful.</p>

<p>We could always start a UK-based Answers.OnStartups event - I would be happy to help organise - you can find my contact details in my profile.  Perhaps other UK-based readers can comment as to whether they would find this useful?</p>

<p>The other route you might find useful from a networking perspective is vendor events.  I'm primarily Microsoft technology based and have been to one or two (free) Microsoft events - you sometimes get to meet some quite relevant people.  I'm sure other vendors run these sort of things and maybe you can find something that is relevant to your platform/space.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

If you are in London you may also find the new Google Campus facility useful.

http://www.campuslondon.com/

They have events, opportunities to get access to some interesting people and there is also shared workspace through http://www.techhub.com/ (although not free and some other interesting but not free events they organise too)
