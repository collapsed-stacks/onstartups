## ReturnPath vs. SendGrid: Looking for advice

SocialGrow needs to do either ReturnPath or SendGrid to ensure our emails are whitelisted. 

How do you compare the two? Under the Silver SendGrid option it looks like we are required to separately get an account and pay a fee with ReturnPath also. 

I called the sales lines for both today several times and just got dumped into general mailbox. 

Does anybody have experience with either one or could compare the two?

I'm not directly familiar with ReturnPath's services, but it sounds like they will certify your email (but you are still responsible for delivery). SendGrid normally handles delivery and will resell the ReturnPath certification for you. 

I don't know what the deliverability would look like if you sent through SendGrid, but did not sign up for their certification add-on, but I may have an alternative. 

I am working on an email relay product similar to SendGrid that is already offering extremely good deliverability across the board (independent of any whitelisting certifications) assuming that you follow standard processes like DKIM signing your email. We are presently in beta.

I tried sendgrid and they were unable to provision my free account so I try them. Customer service is terrible. Would advise against it.
