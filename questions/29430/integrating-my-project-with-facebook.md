What if i want to integrate my online website with facebook?

By integrating i mean, there would be a link on facebook that will take the user to my website directly but i am not talking about advertising, but rather making my website a part of facebook or any other social networking website as a matter of fact.

Is it possible?

Whom should i contact?

Create a Facebook Fan page.
There are "How to's" all over the net.
Your Facebook Fan page will link back to your website and be a hub of your online activity.

Be careful you're not putting the cart in front of the horse. Why would anyone on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn want to click on a link to go to your web site? You need to think through that strategy first.

The most effective strategy for merging social media channels with your web site is content marketing. This means creating an integrated blog component on your web site that delivers remarkable and interesting content that others will be interested in reading. It's quite straightforward to link your blog entries automatically to Twitter and Facebook fan pages.

Without content, nobody will have a reason to like your page in the first place or follow you on Twitter (or anywhere else). Another strategy that can be integrated with content marketing is curation. Share other content with your audience that is related to your area of expertise. This will help expand your audience which will, in turn, generate more overall awareness of your web site.
