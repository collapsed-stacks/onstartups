I'm working on a website that I'll need beta tested soon. It's a startup. Where should I go to get a good pool of testers? It would also be great to have a good pool of hackers who can show security holes before it's released.

You can get great feedback at http://news.ycombinator.com make sure to post in the "Ask" section.

Also, you can try to submit your startup to http://betali.st 

You should also submit your startup to as many blogs and bloggers as possible.

<p>You can use the following services to find beta testers.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.prefinery.com/" rel="nofollow">Prefinery</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.utest.com/" rel="nofollow">uTest</a></p></li>

<p>I have been fairly successful finding beta testers in LinkedIn and Twitter, by providing a link to a landing page that has some information about my web app. In LinkedIn I just ask the question about people wanting to do beta testing and there is usually a good number of people willing to try. </p>

<p>I usually use <a href="http://unbounce.com" rel="nofollow">unbounce.com</a> to create landing pages.</p>
