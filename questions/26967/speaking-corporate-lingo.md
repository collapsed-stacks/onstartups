Are there resources out there on the etiquette and 'lingo' used when talking/contact companies? Working with small companies it's all quite easy-going, but I don't want to give away in 5s to to a company VP that I'm startup novice :)

The best corporate lingo is to pay attention and ask a lot of questions.  Not only will you learn more but you'll discover people love to talk about themselves.  You might find that after a 10 minute conversation you've only asked 3 questions and they did all the talking.  They'll go tell their buddy your the best conversationalist they've met in years.

<p><strong>Lingo</strong></p>

<p>Unless you're talking about things like standard commercial contract terms (e.g. "2% 10 net 30") you'd find <a href="http://www.dummies.com/store/product/Small-Business-For-Dummies-3rd-Edition.productCd-0470177470.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it's going to depend completely on the company's industry and location, and it changes all the time.</p>

<p>For instance, I've worked in the hand tools manufacturing industry, where everybody knows what a "screw machine" is, and writing software in Silicon Valley, where most people would have no idea and probably snicker about it.</p>

<p>But it's not worth worrying about. Until you've been in an industry for a few years, people are going to peg you as an outsider or noob in 5s no matter what you do, and trying to avoid that will just mark you as a wannabe who misuses the jargon. Just focus on using plain language to describe how your products and services can solve their problems, and ask about any lingo they use that you don't know, and you should be fine.</p>

<p><strong>Etiquette</strong></p>

<p>You seem interested in sales starting with a cold call. Your preferred search engine will turn up lots of hits for "business etiquette", "cold call etiquette" and "sales etiquette", and there are books on how to sell effectively, but here are a few general tips.</p>

<ul>
<li>Always be polite and use "standard English".</li>
<li>If you're meeting them in person and you know the norm for attire in their industry, dress a little better than that. If you don't know the norm, find out. If you can't find out, wear a conservative suit and tie that fits you well and looks good.</li>
<li>Respect the other person's time and attention, and above all, don't be a pest.</li>
<li>Don't cuss or make sexist/racist/dirty jokes, even if they do.</li>
<li>When you shake hands, do it firmly but not bone-crushingly, and a bit more firmly for men than for women.</li>
</ul>
