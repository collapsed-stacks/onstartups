I am adding new section to my site where students or alumni of a particular film schools can be associated with their schools. Facebook did something similar in the early days and later they went with "Like" button that opened that option to anyone. Granted, I could just add my own "Like" functionality and spare a user from a  learning curve but before I do that I thought I'd cast the following question into the wide pool of entrepreneurial talent on this site:

What are other "Like" alternatives?

Thanks.

**EDIT:**
I should've shared more what I intend to do. Some folks that will 'link' or 'associate' their profiles with these 'groups' will be posting projects. At the bottom of the page I'll add a section listing 'projects by ...' 

Maybe I should call it "Friend of ..." whatever school, than the projects will be "Projects by friends of the school". Not sure though that it is simple enough...

<p>Just to throw this one out there...<a href="http://digg.com/" rel="nofollow">Digg</a> made their own 'term'...not a totally new term because it plays on the word dig. To Digg something means you like it.</p>

<p>Here's an idea...what if you coined a term that's related to the film industry somehow. I'm not in the industry, but I'll just throw out some random ideas (most of them are probably bad) in the vein of brainstorming:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Wrap"</li>
<li>"Take"</li>
<li>"Join Scene"</li>
<li>"Mix"</li>
</ul>

I think the "Like" button would be too general in your case.  Why not allow a user to "associate" their account with one school?  Or put something in their user profile that lets them choose a school.

**EDIT:** In looking at synonyms, you could make those school pages "groups" and join that group.  So some sort of "join".

You might also be able to use "network" somehow ... not sure how, but I like the sound of it.
