We're launching a new web site in July - a mix of social media and user generated content. 

The site will have a broad and simple value proposition - think of this as horizontal segmentation. This will be complemented with multiple vertical niche segment building on the horizontal segmentation.

What is the one best idea you'd suggest to help us go viral? 

Thanks!

I would recommend asking the new member to import their contact list and send invites to the people that they select.  The key thing with viral loops is to make the process extremely easy.

The effort required must be much less than their passion for your product.

If you have an advertising budget I would suggest StumbleUpon.com.  

SU provides highly targeted traffic for example; bloggers between 18-35 who are searching for videos online.  Not only would you be getting highly targeted visitors that may become long term users of your service but you are also introducing your product to the right crowd to help it go viral.

StumbleUpon charges $50 per thousand visitors which, though pricey, is a very good value for such targeted traffic. 

Of course this all depends on the quality of the content and service that you are offering.  No amount of money or planning can "make" something go viral.

Hmm - from your description, your launch could be:

 - Twitter
 - answers.onstartups.com
 - youtube
 - facebook

Each would have a different approach. Can you provide a bit more information?  perhaps a USP statement? Your target audience?
