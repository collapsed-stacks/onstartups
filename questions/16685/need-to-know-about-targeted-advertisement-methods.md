I'm developing a website related to dining out in India. It's a kind of website that gives all information about restaurants. There are many similar kinds of services in India. So I would like to know how I can advertise to a targeted audience cost-effectively. Any ideas in this regard will be helpful for me.

I don't have any experience in the Indian market I am sorry to say, but I think online marketing is fairly universal. You will have some challenges if there is a lot of competition, but here are some thoughts that come to mind:

 - Focus on niches where there are not others already covering it well. For instance maybe local restaurants - people may search for "Good restaurant Hyderabad", so you could bid for that keyword phrase
 - Partner with restaurants in your area. If you offer them some special reason to sign up with your service, you might be able to differentiate, and have them link directly to your service from their pages.
 - Run very "out there" promotions. Things like "Anyone who can eat at 20 of these 100 restaurants in the next week wins $100"

Basically, if the competition is heavy, you will need to be creative in your marketing to keep costs down. Focusing on a niche instead of being a general site will also help!
