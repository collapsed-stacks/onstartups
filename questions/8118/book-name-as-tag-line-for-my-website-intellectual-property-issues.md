I am planning to use the name of a book (about 3-4 yrs old) as the tag line of my website.
Its three words long.

What are the IP issues here, how do i know if i can use it legally or if the author doesn't allow the name to be used as the tag line of my website.

thanks in advance.

<p>You need to be careful as to how you use any work that someone else has copyrighted but it appears that titles of books seem to be a little trickier that other works. This <a href="http://www.publaw.com/titles.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> over at Pub Law seems to say that titles are not protected as copyrighted material (Taken from Pub Law reference below):</p>

<p>"Copyright Office Regulations and judicial decisions have made it clear that titles are only the equivalent of short slogans and therefore a title does not contain sufficient expression to be worthy of copyright protection"</p>

<p>Now, the title could be a trademark but that seems to only apply to a series of books not a single title. Again, same Pub Law article quote:</p>

<p>"A publisher cannot obtain federal trademark registration for a single title, but a series title may be federally registered."</p>

<p>I guess you need to figure out if the author either registered the title as a trademark (since it might be used to identify something else) or it's a series of books. You can search for trademarks <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is a pretty interesting question since it is not handled consistently.</p>

<p>Have you considered doing a <a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&amp;state=4006:j6mtul.1.1" rel="nofollow">trademark search</a>? </p>

<p>I would also review the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/Basic%5FFacts%5FTrademarks.jsp" rel="nofollow">trademark faq</a> to get some ideas about the validity of using a pre-existing phrase.</p>

Have a back up name planned...  but go for it. Then if you get contacted you can take it down and tell the press what happened and use the whole experience as a marketing tool to promote your website.
