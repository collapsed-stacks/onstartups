I have noticed on sites like facebook that they allow you to buy facebook credits by entering in your phone number on the website in the payment options screen.

How does this work?

Google MobilePayments, there are a lot of players now in that market.  Mobile payments are more expensive than credit cards.

this not nesessarily true, in many cases billing can be via payments card, and in some cases cheaper than card. as Frank (cool name!) billing to the mobile bill is a different and possibly more expensive way forward
