I have an app near completion using no libraries for frameworks of any kind.  I literally started with blank .txt files and went to work.  I did this as a means to learn web development but after about a year or two of part-time work I feel I have a good grasp ( beginner level - professional ) of web.  I also will have a working prototype ( and useful application ) that is compatible with major modern browsers.  

However, I have to ask myself if I'm delusional as all successful applications seem to incorporate libraries/frameworks of some kind.  Whenever I do a view source on popular web startups I can see this.

What I've noticed is that IE is starting to comply with W3 similarly to FF, Chrome, and Safari...so that only supporting IE9+ and FF, Chrome, and Safari, I don't have to use libraries to abstract events...I can just use addEventListener...similarly with DOM access.  Also, I did not find writing an MVC too time-consuming.

Is it possible to release a web app w/ out the use of libraries/frameworks.

Is there an angle I am missing? 

Besides the fact that I cut out a huge market by not supporting older browsers.

Launch already. Use this "v1" as a test to see if there is a market for your application.

It is possible to build web apps without a framework. That said, the reason large sites use frameworks is because the framework:

(1) Typically makes it easier for multiple people to work on the code at the same time and 

(2) Allows you to piggy back on improvements to the framework (e.g. security patches)

Also, if this was your first web application, framework or not, you are going to learn a lot along the way. You should anticipate re-writing everything from scratch after your launch. So instead of incremental updates to your v1 app, work on a v2 right away.

RE your implied question about older browser versions. Depending on your market (i.e. will a large portion of your users use this "at work"?), you don't have to worry about older browser versions.
