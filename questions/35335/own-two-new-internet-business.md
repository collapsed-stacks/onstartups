I am a little confused, with two Internet businesses, do I need to have two separate EIN's and TIN.  I was told that I do not but I just wanted to confirmed this.  
This is with two different Companies so I wasn't for sure, and feedback would be appreicated. :)

Each incorporated entity in the USA needs to have a separate EIN/TIN (it's the same number) because taxes are paid separately.
