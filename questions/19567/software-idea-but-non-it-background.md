I am an entreprenuer, who has always been keen on IT, but having no background of programming. I have several ideas which i would like to implement one at a time. These involve combination of Mobile / Tab applications and windows based application.

I want to start off with my own capital to begin with. The question is how to figure what are the skill sets required for executing my idea? or are there project manager whom i can hire to to build a team according the required skill sets?

Is there any resource like a book or website where I can read about the organization structure required for successful execution of an idea? Or how do i figure what skills sets are required for my ideas?

How to trust project managers with sharing ideas?

I need programmers who can create apps on android and windows.

Do i need design experts for frontend presentation of the apps? 

The apps need to be online and accessible through the intranet as well as internet.

Is there any book which can guide me through management and execution of the technical aspect of the business?

I would say that unless you have a very big pot of money, you need to do something yourself. I think that even with a big pot of money, you should take care of critical things yourself. You should for example make drafts of the design yourself. My poibt is that it is your idea and your vision and there are only so much you can communicate to others. By making the design yourself, it will be easier for others to understand your vision.

You need a technical cofounder.

I just want to add that (as a technical person), what you're looking to develop is NOT a simple product.  You want:

 - android app
 - iPhone app
 - iPad app
 - web/extranet app
 - web/intranet app
 - mobile (other) app
 - windows forms app

That's a ridiculous amount of coding, no matter how you slice it.

Focus your idea.  Make it something that you can either build or have built quickly.  You seem a bit all over the place and it will likely make anyone technical enough to really help you run away quickly (and those that smile and say yes to helping you will likely leave you disappointed and poorer).

You dont need a technical co founder, and you dont need a big pot of money.  What you need to do is hire a highly technical person to help you plan the software.

This person can be someone with high level software architecture experience, a former CTO, a just your basic super nerd.  You can pay them as a consultant to write you a spec, and then in the long run you can pay them to oversee your project as a project manager.

If you offshore your software, you will want to make sure you have your highly technical person help with interviews, and still oversee the work here for you in the uSA.

An important thing to do is pay attention, and learn as much from this person.

To find a project manager you can trust, you could do the following. interview various candidates and run interview question with typical business question (google for them). Some such questions allow you to score a person according the his/her understanding of business. Then you pick the guy with the lowest score, who is in every other aspect competent. You can then, be a bit more sure that he/she will not run off with your idea.

You say that you are keen on IT systems, then you should well versed with how IT systems work. If you are not, study a bit around those systems that you are imagining. This will help you to devide the system you are envisioning into smalller modules. Then plan for hiring skills for each modules.
