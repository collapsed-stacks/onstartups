I just installed the latest version, but I'm experiencing what seems to be software glitches...or I just don't know what I'm doing. I can't seem to classify a payment as a debit card purchase.  If I record it as credit card purchase, I can't seem to reconcile the payment of the debit card purchase from my bank account without writing a check.  The system only allows me to choose from credit card or bank check purchases.

Please help!

Debit card *is* a bank check purchase, since the money comes out of your bank account directly. So, for recording purposes in your check register, you will have to indicate that as a "check". That way your account will reconcile with the bank statement that you receive. You can always write in the memo that it was a debit card purchase.
