For example, say I develop a piece of software that helps eBay users. Can I call this software 'Ebayer Helper' (note 'ebayer' not 'ebay') or are there potential legal repercussions?

<p>The kind of protection that could apply to your situation is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_use" rel="nofollow">Nominative Use</a>. Even though you may ultimately win a dispute in court on those grounds, that is not to say you won't draw a cease and desist letter or lawsuit from eBay.</p>
