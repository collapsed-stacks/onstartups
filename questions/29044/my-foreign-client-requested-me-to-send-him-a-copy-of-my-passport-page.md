I am a business translator/interpreter in Hangzhou, China. A British client said that he is going to China and he will hire me as his interpreter when he is in China. He asked my bank information except the pin. After that he requested me to send him a copy of my passport page. Do you think this request is normal/acceptable? My previous clients never asked me for a copy of my passport page.

A passport includes lots of information which, when combined with the banking information, could be very useful when trying to steal an identity. Some banks will ask for a copy of your passport page. Beware of people that ask for one thing, then just one more thing, and so on. I bet there will be another request for another piece of personal information. Do a web search on the person and email address.

I suspect the request is probably innocent so that they can see what you look like etc, though to be safe I would say yes and tell him you will be masking out certain items for security precautions (such as part of your DOB or passport number).

Do not underestimate the power of reciprocity. If he asks for a copy of your passport, why don't you ask for HIS copy too? 

If all he wants is a picture, you can send him a picture instead of your passport. Do you know who your client is? Do you have good references about him?
