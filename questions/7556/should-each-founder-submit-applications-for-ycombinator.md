I'm not sure if this is the right place, but HN didn't seem appropriate and Paul Graham may not answer too quickly.

I'm going to soon submit an application for YC for this summer with a co-founder. I'm confused about whether all founders should submit applications, or just one. The issue is this one question, which seems should be addressed to each co-founder, but is only addressed to the applicant (as it appears on my application):

    Please tell us about the time you, ehsanul, most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

Both me and my co-founder have something to say about this, but the question is made very specifically to the account of the applicant.

Edit: I forgot the point out the important point that all other questions seem to be general, or apply to both founders.

You should only submit one application, unless you're submitting multiple ideas. As it says in the FAQ:

> **Our group has two ideas. Can we submit two applications?**
> 
> Ok. Just submit them from the YC
> accounts of different founders.

As far as the question you're specifically asking about, keep in mind that YC has to read through hundreds, if not more, of these applications. It'd probably be best to determine a) are either of your answers to this question *really* going to help you stand out? b) if so, which one of your answers will do it more so? Then apply from the account of that founder.
