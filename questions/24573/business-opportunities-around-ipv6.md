(I asked this a while back on startups.com but didnt receive any response. I hope its not a problem posting here)

There's a coming shortage of IPv4 addresses, for which IPv6 is the solution. eg: http://www.v3.co.uk/v3/news/2271702/five-per-cent-ipv4-addresses


"The rapid depletion of the address space, which has fallen from 10 per cent in January, means that it is expected to be used up by 2012, so the onus is on organisations to move to the new IPv6 addresses.
 
What could be possible business opportunities around this space?

The problem is that this *really* only matters as it relates to publicly routable IP addresses.

Your best opportunity here is probably in IPv4->IPv6 migration consulting.  There isn't a lot you can do from a practical standpoint without being tightly integrated with an ISP.
