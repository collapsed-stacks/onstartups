I've built a new developer website and have found some companies willing to discuss some sort of partnership. These are companies that sell products that would normally be advertised on sites like mine.

However, my traffic is only around 4,000 page views per week and my goal is to get these companies to give me a few thousand dollars a month.

What can I offer them in return for this money? Here's what I've brainstormed so far.

* A run-of-site banner ad.
* A news article every month or two about their products or company.
* Perhaps a couple of articles that describe using their products.
* List them as a partner of the site (if they want).
* A commitment to continue advertising after my site's traffic grows and the site becomes self-sufficient. (I'm really not sure what this commitment should look like.)
* Part ownership of the site?

At a time when money is so tight, which of these make sense to get them to part with their hard-earned money? Anything else I could offer?

One thing I did in my popular laptop forum, was have a 'sponsored' section, with a subforum dedicated to talking about our sponsors' products. My members could discuss and ask questions directly to the people who sold them and the sponsor could advertise and educate their demographic directly through the forum.

It turned out to be win-win for both of us, hopefully it could fit into your site.

Work for them. You know. Like doing work.

Tell them. At least someone gets a good laugh out of that delusion. Sorry, but more thn a dollar per page view is highly dilusional.

Delusion 2: this has nothing to do with money being so tight at the moment. You just ask for 100 times normal rate. Only idiots would pay that, money tight or not.

Seriously, what do you expect? Successfull blogs make money. But they have thousands of *visitors* per *day*, not 4000 per week, and views on top (i.e. one visitor may be many views).
