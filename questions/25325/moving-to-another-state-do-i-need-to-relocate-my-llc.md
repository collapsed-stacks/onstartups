I have an LLC for my custom software development business. It is currently registered in Virginia where I have lived for years. Now I am moving to NC because of my wifes work. Everything I do is online, and when necessary I can drive back to VA for face to face meetings.

My concern is, do I need to register my LLC in North Carolina or can I remain registered in Virginia?

I am the only employee. It is an LLC owned by my wife and I. Appreciate any information about business relocation laws.

EDIT:
For those who find this question, here is what I have found in the weeks since posting this. I am going to work with a local business that will provide me office space in VA for what I have scheduled meetings (2-3 times a month). That office will serve as my official business location, I'll continue to pay VA business taxes. I did have to update various state and federal agencies to my new address, but that would have to be done even if I only moved across town. So I can remain registered in VA, even if I work most days from a house in NC.

Why don't you call your state business offices?  (both NC and VA as well as the IRS) You will get better answers than here.  

After you do, post up what you found and what you plan to do.

Or just contact an accountant.  It is likely they will know what to do in your situation.

I'm not a CPA or an attorney, but i have been neck deep into this sort of stuff for the past few weeks, because i'm also looking into forming an LLC as a non-resident.

As far as i know, you can remain registered in Virginia BUT you need to appoint a registered agent with a physical address (no PO box or private mailbox) & they act on your behalf there and receives official notices like franchise tax notices, company notices of pending legal matters, etc. 

The registered agent can either be a shareholder/officer from your company or you can hire one (fees from $50-$400 per year)

p.s. i've been looking into this matter for the state of Delaware, so it might be different in Virginia.

You should probably re-domesticate it to NC or qualify to business in NC.
