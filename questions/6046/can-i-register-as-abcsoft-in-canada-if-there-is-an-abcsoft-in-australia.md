I was going to register my company name as "ABCsoft", but I discovered ABCsoft.com is already registered. Can I register as ABCsoft in Canada if there is an ABCsoft in Australia?

Yes you can, but you have to take into account that people may get the two of you confused. Legally it's fine, but would you want to call yourself ABCSoft and when someone looks you up online, they get directed to somebody else's website.

Looking at the website and doing a whois on the server, it looks like the website is a link farm, so it may still be available (for a couple thousand bucks).

You can try contacting them to see if they're interested in selling. I'd wager to bet 'yes' since the domain name was bought about 14 years ago for a period of 15 years, and no one's put up anything of substance there.

Times are gone when you built anything and it was sold in a split second time frame, now it's all about branding and market is becoming ever so competitive. So if the nature of your business is online I wouldn't recommend going for the name, however as the other guy here said, if ABCSoft.com is just a link farm, then I really doubt there presence and SEO rank which can be a good point in your favour and you can go ahead.

Legally I don't think it will be a problem as long as you are not registering it in Australia.

Yes, actually in some countries you can even register ABCsoft if there is already one other ABCsoft registered, you just get a different business registration number. This is not possible for every country though - different countries have different regulations.
