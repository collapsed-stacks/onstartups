Before taking on a project, there is always a question: "How many people will use this?" So how do I measure that "people", at least inaccurate.

<p>For something quick, dirty, and fairly cheap, try something like the following process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Research potential competitors and their products and/or services and realistically assess whether or not you can provide a unique selling proposition that differs enough from the competition.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.google.com/trends" rel="nofollow">Google Trends</a>, the
    <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__c=1000000000&amp;__u=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none" rel="nofollow">External    Keyword Tool</a>, and
    the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__c=1000000000&amp;__u=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_STATS#search.none" rel="nofollow">Traffic Estimator</a> to get an
    idea of how    popular your project,
    potential    competitors, and the
    general industry    might be. If it
    seems popular enough,    move on to
    the next steps.</li>
<li>Create an introduction video to your
product idea describing it and
perhaps some concept art. You can do this for free even without a video camera if you have a microphone and PowerPoint. Just do a screencast using <a href="http://camstudio.org/" rel="nofollow">CamStudio</a>, an open source screencast software.</li>
<li>Sign up to an email newsletter
service like <a href="http://mailchimp.com" rel="nofollow">MailChimp</a> or <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/" rel="nofollow">Campaign
Monitor</a>. Both have free signup and either no or very minimal cost below a certain number of subscribers/email sent.</li>
<li>Create a landing page on a website
with the video, the newsletter signup
form, and perhaps a written
description as well. At the end of
the video, indicate that if they want
to be informed when the product comes
out, they should sign up (for free)
to the newsletter.</li>
<li>Create a Google AdWords campaign that
directs people to your landing page.
The ad should read the same as if the
product actually existed. Depending on the industry, you can probably get a statistically relevant sample for a few hundred dollars or less.</li>
<li>Measure the level of interest based
on the number of views of the ad, the
number of click-throughs, the bounce
rate, and the number of people who
sign up during a given time period or
ad budget. If the numbers are
promising, then you can move on.</li>
<li>Create a Minimum Viable Product and
begin selling it. If sales go well,
begin adding features and developing
it further.</li>
</ol>

@vituosi makes some great points, but I use an easier approach.  Take your most realistic competitor, (similar product, pricing).  Choose a company that has not been around 10 years!  I usually choose the poorest performing company with the same pricing.  Not a hobby, but a real company struggling to make it.

Then find out how many customers they have.  Some of them will actually tell you if you call them and pretend you want to sign up, write an article, or you can do some digging (for example web hosts by how many sites on the IP block)

Last, take the number of clients, multiply it times their lowest price point, and then divide it by two!

That low number will give you your WORST CASE scenario.  I always use a worst case to measure if a product is viable, and also to keep development within budget and time.  This helps you look close at the comeptitors, and use them a gauge of your success.
