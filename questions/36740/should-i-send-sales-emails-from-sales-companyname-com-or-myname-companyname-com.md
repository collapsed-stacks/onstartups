I don't want to appear impersonal, but having a sales specific email address would be useful to let everyone who is doing sales have access to it.

What do you do? And how has it worked out for you?

For me, the answer to this is obvious - people do business with people.

I don't even have a business card for any of my ventures. I have a card that has my personal information on it.

Note: "no-reply" type email addresses are no longer allowed in some parts of Europe.

If you are not doing a mass mailing then it should be from an individual at the company so using `yourname@yourcompany.com` is pretty close to a must.  You want the customer to have a relationship as personal as possible.

If you are doing a mass mailing you would do this from `sales@companyname.com`.

If you want to have an email on your website for sales related issues, then sales@yourcompany.com makes sense. 

Depending on the nature of business, it may require more of a personal touch with a lot of correspdence. Then personal email will be used.

If a specific sales person is receiving client email, it should be placed in a CRM system. That way, other people in the company can see what is going on with the client if needed and service the client when the specific sales person is not around. This can be very helpful during turn-over. The former sales person's email address can be forwarded to the new person for a period of time to notify clients about the new person. You may even have to open that account to others to sort out any email that was not put into the CRM system. Separating personal and company email is encouraged for this reason.

I would say use yourname@yourdomain.com.  I know that when I am browsing someone's site and need to ask a question, if I only see sales@yourdomain.com, then I feel I am going to be hassled into purchasing something, like a used car salesman does.

If you send from yourname@yourcompany.com make the emails pretty personal. I wouldn't use the email sales@ to send a sales email especially if even some of the emails are not double opt in. Maybe no-reply@ for a mass email, or team@

Not sure I agree with using an impersonal email address like sales@companyname for any emails you send, whether they be directly to someone or as a mass mailing.

For instance, why take an impersonal mass mailing and make it even more impersonal. At least if it has your personal email and your signature, people know they can contact a real person. If you're worried about fairness between other sales reps, split up the emails so you use all your sales staff's email addresses. In other words, if there are 4 reps, split the contacts in 1/4's.

We always use a real salesperson's e-signature card when sending any types of emails, and it's worked out quite well for us.

If you are using the email to support your clients product or solutions then "sales@companyname.com" will be good , but if you are responding enquiries or dealing with your clients then be specific and mention your name in your mail id. It makes your clients comfortable to communicate with you.
