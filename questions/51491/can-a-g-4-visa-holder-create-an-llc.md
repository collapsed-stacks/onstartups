<p>I'm in the US with a G-4 Dependant visa, and I'm legally authorized to work in the US. I have a start-up business. Can I create an LLC in the US?</p>

<p>You can create LLC regardless of your immigration status. You can create a US LLC without even being in the US.</p>

<p>Whether or not you can <strong>work</strong> as a self employed under that LLC depends on the State Department and the USCIS.</p>
