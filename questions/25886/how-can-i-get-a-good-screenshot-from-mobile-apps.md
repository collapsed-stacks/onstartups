I want to take a screenshot of my apps along with the phone just like in [Color][1] landing page. How can I achieve this? I tried to take a photo of the phone but it doesn't look as good. No, taking the screenshot of the emulator is not an option?

Thanks for sharing your experience.

<p>Grab a stock photo of a phone. Here's one of the <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-photo-16053452-iphone-4th-generation.php?st=3fe4c8a" rel="nofollow">iphone</a>, here's an <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-illustration-15492229-smart-phone.php?st=567961e" rel="nofollow">android-like</a> one. (And there are more on that site if you don't like those). </p>

<p>Take a screenshot from the device itself (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=take+a+screenshot+from+my+phone#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=how+do+I+take+a+screenshot+from+my+phone&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=63a9a9c9a9bd96d6&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=935" rel="nofollow">easy to do</a> on either phone), combine in Photoshop.</p>

Pushing and holding power+home on the iPhone takes an exact screenshot of your devices screen.

Photoshop: (Camera Stock Photo +  Screenshop while running program on an emulator) = Best Option
