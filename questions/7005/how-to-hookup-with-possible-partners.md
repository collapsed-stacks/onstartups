I have always been an interested is starting and running my own business. I have built small websites basically for the fun of it, never intending them to get large. I run my own company now but my heart is not truly in it. I have a head full of ideas, a couple rather large ones, but no skill set to pull them off. This first one I want to pull off is a software program with a cloud computing back end.

I guess where I am going with this is... Is there a place out there for people with ideas to hook up with people with the skills to create partnerships of sorts. Or is there another venue where you can sell your ideas perhaps for a percentage of the eventual company. If I had the money to hire developers I would surely do that in a heart beat but at this time do not. 

Looking for options to move some of these ideas in my head out into the real world.

<p>There's a searchable wiki for people to pair up with others who are looking for partners w/ specific skills: <a href="http://www.startuplinkup.com/en/Main%5FPage" rel="nofollow">http://www.startuplinkup.com</a></p>

<p>For finding people in person, I'd recommend looking for startup / entrepreneurship groups on <a href="http://www.meetup.com" rel="nofollow">Meetup.com</a>, and attending <a href="http://barcamp.org" rel="nofollow">BarCamps</a> in your area.</p>

<p>Finally, Twitter is an invaluable resource for connecting with your local startup scene. Tweet about your interests, use search.twitter.com to find people talking about similar things, and get the conversation going. Build up the number of people you're following and you'll start finding out about more events &amp; opportunities.</p>

I will second the motion on Meetup.com. I belong to a number of groups. They can be excellent for networking as well as for learning. 

Best of luck,

I'm interested in hearing more about your proposal.  You had me at "cloud computing back end".    :-)

Cloud Computing, is relatively a new technology, that very few, are eager to understand or make the jump.

I have two accounts, Azure and Amazons, do you have a preference?
