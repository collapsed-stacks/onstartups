As part of being transparent, we're thinking of putting our contract up online in our services section. The idea is that people would be able to have a look, question us in advance, and overall be more comfortable with us.

Is this a bad idea?

Maybe go one step further and do a synopsis in bullet points in English highlighting how fair your contract is. 

You could even turn this into marketing collateral - something to use when the buyer is on the edge.  After all, most people don't care about the contract until they're close to buying.

A key skill that every real business operator must learn (or otherwise go out of business) is to see things as your customers see them.

Would you sign a car loan document without knowing or reading the terms of the loan contract?

That kind of reasoning should inform your actions.

Per my comments above - Y*E*S. Of course. 

> Is this a bad idea?

Only in two particular ways. 

1) You have something to hide. (I mean no insult, I am just saying that this is one way in which full disclosure will damage sales.)

2) You make the visitor nervous by elevating legal terms and language to such a high visibility that they feel that they are signing their lives away, or their attention is taken away from your value proposition or offer with the legal language. 

There are two schools of thought about online legal agreements:

One is that you make it readily available to the purchaser but you do not "immerse" the purchaser in your contract. Example: a clickable link that goes to a popup page that can be printed out that is in one of the pages of the signup or checkout process.

The other is that you make the contract language an integral part of the signup process. This is usually implemented as a scrollable text box in the signup form that contains your contract text, with a check box. So the user has to manually check the box saying "I agree to the TOS" before proceeding. 

Consult an attorney to make this decision. I have always felt that full, detailed disclosure up front is the safest option, but it may erode some sales due to buyer fear, confusion or indecision. 

One last thing: Sunil has excellent points about using elements of your agreement as marketing collateral. But my experience has been that legal language is generally not exciting, unless you are offering terms of use that in themselves create exceptional value (keywords for legals terms that would be benefits would be "royalty free", "unlimited", "no cost to purchaser", etc).

I believe it's a good idea, or at least, it can't hurt. It's not that much different from putting up a software license agreement online, or a trading terms agreement. These kinds of documents are commonly found on web sites in all sorts of industries.

Information online such as contracts and pricing also can avoid a lot of repeated customer enquiries.
