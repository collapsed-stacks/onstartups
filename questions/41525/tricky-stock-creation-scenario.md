My partners and I own a couple business'.  They are both LLC's.  We want to start a third as a shell corporation which will own the other two by way of shares not the LLC partner names on everything bit.

Is there a rule of thumb which allows:

 - Majority shareholding for the shell corporation
 - Lesser value shares for a President at the head of each company
 - Even lesser value shares for employees in some sort of stock option scenario

Further are there terms that go along with these that are commonly used to describe this type of thing?

Your mixture of partnership, corporation and LLC terminology makes it a bit difficult to understand the scenario you are describing. Nevertheless, I believe I can provide direct answers to your specific questions:

 - There is no rule of thumb.
 - The only relevant terms I can think of are parent and subsidiary.

I suspect that you will not find the foregoing answers helpful. I suspect, further, that my answers are not helpful because you have assumed facts concerning business structure and compensation that may not best address your underlying objectives (which you have not stated).

You probably should explain those objectives to an experienced business lawyer so s/he can get you pointed in the right direction - a direction that may involve structure and compensation dramatically different from what you have described.
