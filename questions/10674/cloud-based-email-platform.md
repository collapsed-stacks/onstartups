What the the cloud based email platform available that provides message scheduling and queuing feature? Something similar to Sendgrid but also with message scheduling and queuing for transactional emails.

What is the use case for scheduling or queuing **transactional** messages? I would presume that if a message is transactional, you would want it to go out ASAP

(Background - I am the Product Manager on a cloud-based email relay project right now)
