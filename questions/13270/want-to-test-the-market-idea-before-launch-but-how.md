We are working on web app for restaurant/cafe/bars and want to test the market.

What we want to achieve?
As our product is still in development stage and take at least 30 days to come in beta stage, but
We want to show our product/idea to users and bloggers through some kind of screen cast with voice, so that they can have idea about what is product all about and how it will benefit to uses business.

Our secondary objective is to get beta users.

Benefit to user/blogger
1. Get discount on release.
2. Blogger will get coupons so that they can distribute among their readers.

What we did so far?
1. Create the list of potential uses [company info, contact email etc.]
2. Created the list of forums, blogger.

Our questions
1. Is this a right approach?
2. How we can create awesome screencast with great voice without full product.

Hoping great answers.

Any help is appreciable.

The short answer is that you get out there and build a prototype to show to businesses.

The long answer has to do with the fact that restaurants are a VERY different beast when it comes to selling them. I work directly with many restaurants and would be happy to discuss your idea with you if you want to drop me a line directly (josh [at] textaurant [dot] com). Check out the website first - if that's your idea, I might not be the best sounding board. :)

An inexpensive way would be to create some screen shots of what the product will look like.  Then create a small and high quality website to market your web app.  Use the screen shots to explain its functionality and benefits.  Make sure to have a way for potential customers to contact you on.  Use this website as a tool when directly contacting restaurant industry potential clients.  Try to sell your product to them.  You could also post your website on restaurant industry forums to generate traffic.  

Then wait to see if anyone contacts you.  If they do, you have can talk to them about beta testing.  If no one contacts you, the advertising may be ineffective or the product may not be appealing in the market.  At the same time, it would be beneficial to work with experienced restaurant industry professionals to hone your product.  Make sure the value you are trying to deliver is perceived and wanted by these professionals.  Take their feedback and change features to create the benefits they are looking for.
