I am having a serviced based registered firm. I am having some basic questions. 

 1. I want to know how to take projects formally in the name of the company.(I have clients, Just need to know the procedure.)
 2. I need to make some general agreement for clients? Also, how to take payment.


I was working as part time free lancer from 1.5 years and was taking payments directly in my account. Now as I have registered the firm so i want to know the exact procedure to follow.

Please let me know about this.

I am having a registered firm in India and most of the clients are from US(80%) or UK(20%)

Also, I would appreciate any other quick tips for the start-up.

You need a Tax ID for your company and a bank account as the basic minimum.

Next, when you work as consultant just provide the ID and your company name,address. You send the invoice in your company name and then they will send a check to the company that you deposit into the company bank account. Talk to a chartered accountant and you will get good idea.
