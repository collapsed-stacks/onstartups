## Idea for a non-related business while employed

I was wondering if anyone can shed some light on this one. As I worked for my previous employer, I came up with an idea for my startup. While I was employed, I created mockups/wireframes for my product, and quit my job about a month later to work on my business full-time. So, from the time I got the idea to the time I quit, it was during a month of employment. At this time I hadn't even the slightest idea on how to make this technologically possible, but that's another story. The product is not in the same industry and does not compete with my previous employer. 

I did sign a contract that states my ideas belong to the company. It's pretty self explanatory. I started working for the company in a state that enforces these agreements, then moved within the same company to a state that doesn't. I worked in the state that doesn't enforce these a little longer. 

How much of the business will my past employer own if the original idea has been modified to something a little different? What if I sell my business to someone else before my past employer takes any action?

Thanks, in advance, for your input. I would rather not waste my time on a business that will keep me in court for the rest of my productive years.

If it is in an unrelated area then I say just move forward as quickly as you can. It is unlikely the company will come after you.  If you do make a lot of money, you can afford the attorneys to defend what sounds like a very reasonable case.

If your business were related to your previous work, they would have strong grounds but I think a jury would not side with the 'big bad company' trying to 'steal the little guy's work.'

Good luck to you!

Perhaps the biggest hurdle to this would be your question "here" where you admit in public forum that you came up with the idea while employed with them and that you are aware that they are possibly entitled to your idea.

If they make the link between you and your post, then it could cause issues. If you hadn't done that, proof would have been virtually impossible without you tripping yourself up and admitting it to their lawyers (if it got to that point).
