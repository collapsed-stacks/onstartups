I have an offer from a series B startup that includes number of shares but no mention of value of each share or total shares (so I can compute a percentage).  I asked and they were unwilling to disclose the total number of shares the company is divided into -- making the number offered an entirely meaningless number.

I understand this would be a huge red flag if the startup were series A or earlier.  However, this is a 100+ employee series B funded startup.  Is it normal to not be told the value of your stock options at this point?

For perspective, consider a job offer where you'll be paid 100,000 per year, but you aren't allowed to know which currency it'll be in. GBP is pretty good, but ZWD not so much.

It would be great to know why they feel the need to keep this secret and without a really good reason, I'd consider this a red flag. You have to assume that the shares are worthless and consider the offer without them.

The stock grant is a taxable event, I'd say its rather surprising that you're asked to make a commitment without giving you the opportunity to evaluate how much it is going to cost you.

Unless the stocks are worthless, of course.

This is a big red flag.

 1. They don't think you're important enough to take your concerns seriously
 2. They don't share company information and are more likely than usual to hide things from you in the future
 3. Other employees likely didn't get this information either, and perhaps aren't sophisticated enough to care; great candidates may be likely to join this team under these circumstances
 4. The option size may be so small they're embarrassed to share with you.

This seems so unreasonable that if you were to really push them I think they'd give you the information. You shouldn't have to really push them, though.

That said, you could try asking them for a ballpark percentage. In any case, it's likely your percentage will be significantly diluted over new rounds of financing.
