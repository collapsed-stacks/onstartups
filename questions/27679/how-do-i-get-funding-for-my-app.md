I am looking for help with start-up for my idea. I have an idea for an app but can't seem to find out how to get funding, without losing at least 75% equity.

Any ideas welcome.

Start creating value (the actual app) then equity may go down. Also a growing user base will get equity down too.

Can you build and release version 1.0 on your target app store by bootstrapping your idea. For the same amount of effort that you put in getting to funding, you can actually get to customers, book revenues and keep all the equity.
