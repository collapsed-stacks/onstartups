I am in the process of negotiating with my former boss that went out and did his own software start-up.  Everything has been set-up and the product is there.  Currently has stable clients but the revenue is far less than what he was making at his previous job right now.  He is the main person working on the product but he hires developers off sites like elance.com to help with the development.

I was asked to join his company, my job would be to add in all the features that potential clients want and grow the company.

I will get 10% of the revenue and 10% of shares in his company but take a 50% salary cut.  As I said, the revenue number is very low now so that 10% isn't a lot of money.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
