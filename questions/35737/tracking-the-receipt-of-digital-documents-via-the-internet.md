What is the best/cheapest way to: 

 - Known when a digital document is received via the internet,
 - Know who received it,
 - Have them sign that they received it, and
 - Reduce the odds that they will alter or tamper with the document, or be able to tell if they have?

Have some idea, that if needed might address all of these questions, but it'd require me creating a custom solution, instead of just using a service.

<p><strong><a href="https://signsquid.com/" rel="nofollow">Signsquid</a></strong> lets you legally sign contracts online, and also appears to be the only service currently that requires two-factor authentication by email and phone.</p>

<p>Signsquid works by:</p>

<ul>
<li>You uploading your document,</li>
<li>You inviting your signatories,</li>
<li>Signatories getting the related email invites,</li>
<li>Signatories validating their identity via phone to sign document, and</li>
<li>Signatories downloading the signed PDF for your records, and</li>
<li>You downloading the signed PDF for your records.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently Signsquid charges $9 for 10-contracts, and offers one-month free, with no credit card required.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's important to note that just because this service exist, it's up to every user to understand the legal implications of using it. For example, according to Nolo, a leading publisher of do-it-yourself legal guides, <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/electronic-signatures-online-contracts-29495.html" rel="nofollow">some contracts must be on paper (learn more here)</a> -- among other issues.</p>

@blunders I am Signsquid's lawyer. Sorry for the delay to answer your question, we had to do some extensive validations before answering since I am Canadian lawyer and not a US one. So I did a review of the "US Federal Rules of Evidence" as you asked, and we have the opinion that Signsquid is compliant to those rules. However, note that some states may have rules for evidence requiring a handwritten signature (some but few have this requirement).

Most of the states require the followings for an electronic signature be valid:
- That the signature be unique to the person using it.
- It is capable of verification.
- It is under the sole control of the person using it.
- It is linked to data in such a manner that if the data are changed, the digital signature is invalidated.

We can guaranty that Signsquid respects all those criterions.

I hope this answer your questions and feel free to contact me if you need more information.
Enjoy the simplicity of using Signsquid for you signature needs!
