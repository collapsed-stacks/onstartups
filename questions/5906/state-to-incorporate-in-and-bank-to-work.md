My clients are primarily Americans. I want to open an LLC in US to let my clients pay me painlessly. I don't plan to have nor office neither employees in US. 

Which state should I prefer to incorporate? 

And what bank can you advise to work with?

<p>Delaware is widely regarded as having the most LLC friendly environment. One of the start up LLC's with which I am working just incorporated in Delaware. Here's a link to the Delaware Division of Corporations which should be helpful: <a href="http://corp.delaware.gov/" rel="nofollow">link text</a></p>

<p>For a bank, I'd suggest leveraging your existing banking relationship and asking your current bank for a recommendation of a US bank with whom they work who would recognize the value of your relationship with your local bank.</p>

<p>I have helped more than a dozen foreign clients form corporations or LLCs in the U.S.</p>

<p>First, some terminology: One forms (rather than incorporates) an LLC; incorporation applies only to corporations.</p>

<p>Your situation is a bit unusual: My clients typically will be operating a business here (not just collecting payments), so they form the LLC or corporation where it makes sense for the business to operate.</p>

<p>In you case, you will need to have your business operate somewhere. You should consider retaining a tax advisor to help you determine whether there might be a financial advantage to forming your LLC in a low-tax state, given the nature and amount of the payments that you will be receiving. You may find "<a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/10/01/why-not-form-an-llc-in-nevada/" rel="nofollow">Why (not) form an LLC in Nevada?</a>" helpful.</p>

I have recently learned about <a href="http://vermontvirtual.org">Vermont Virtual Companies</a>, which seem to match your situation perfectly. It's a very new thing though.
