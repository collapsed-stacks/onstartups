I am about to become an advisor to a startup based in the US. I am a non-resident alien and the advisory work is carried outside of the US. Compensation will be in the form of performance based warrants. I want to know that given my non-resident alien status and the source of income, would I have any US tax exposure upon receiving / exercising these warrants? If not, do I have to file any tax documents to avoid US tax withholding?

Thank you

You probably will have to pay income tax in the US on the income. You'll need to get an ITIN and file a W8-BEN form with the payer. Check your own home country's tax treaty with the US for any provisions to override the default 30% withholding. These have to be mentioned on W8-BEN.

Also, worth mentioning, that depending on the corporate structure, having a non-resident shareholder may pose tax problems for the startup. I hope they checked that before making agreements with you.
