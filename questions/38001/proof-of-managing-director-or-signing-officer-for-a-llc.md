I'm a member of a domestic US LLC, formed in the state of Delaware. I'd like to open a foreign exchange account with a vendor for my LLC to pay my suppliers in Europe.

The vendor requires a Government issued document as described below:

The state of Delaware does not seem to care who is the managing director of the company. For the state, this seems to be just a title. Where could I find such a document? Which government entity could provide such a document?

Thanks

Makes me wonder if they have any other accounts! Possibly something got lost in the translation. The closest thing we would have here is whatever acceptance document you received when you filed to create your LLC. After that banks here often require a resolution created by the business authorizing the account to be created and who is authorized to have signing power. The government isn't going to issue anything more.

You may want to take another look at the vendor you are working with.
