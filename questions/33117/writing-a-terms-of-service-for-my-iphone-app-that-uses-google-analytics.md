I'm finding a resource for writing a TOC for my app that uses Google Analytics to analyze content traffic.
I don't hire a lawyer and just plan to copy from someone else.
Could you please point out such a resource or an app that I can copy TOC from and modify it?

<p><strong><a href="https://www.docracy.com" rel="nofollow">Docracy</a></strong> has an open collection of great legal documents, and it's completely free. You should definitely check them out.</p>

<p>This might be more than you're looking for, but this is a great Private Policy Document concerning <strong>analytics</strong> and <strong>anonymous usage data</strong>: <a href="https://www.docracy.com/7025/larva-labs-mobile-privacy-policy" rel="nofollow">https://www.docracy.com/7025/larva-labs-mobile-privacy-policy</a></p>

<p>According to the description: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This policy is generally used to cover apps that have
  no specific user data needs beyond analytics and anonymous usage data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good luck!</p>

When you submit the app, include a custom End User License Agreement (EULA). The custom EULA will show-up on the Application Product Page for your application in the App Store, or you can display it in the app itself.

You can simply add this on your APP

> This application uses Google Analytics to anonymously track usage data within the application
