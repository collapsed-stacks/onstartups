What is a good benchmark for a download conversion rate?  In other words, what % of my website traffic can I expect to click "Sign Up Now" button to start a plug-in download (examples: xobni.com and tripware.com)?  Thanks!!

Sometimes questions have no answers...

It can vary literally by 10x depending on the market, product, customer type.

**Also it depends on your traffic *source*.**  Traffic from a good review?  Should be high sign-up rate because they already understand you and are probably coming specifically to sign up.  Traffic from adwords?  Probably sucks.  Traffic from StumbleUpon?  A rate of 0.01% might be reasonable (no joke).

Obviously this depends on a whole lot of factors - what you're selling, how qualified the traffic is, quality of your landing page / web page, etc. etc. But in general terms, the benchmarks I've seen say that it's 1 - 3% for a paid service and 15 - 30% to sign up for free.

It will be interesting to see what others say.

Best of luck!

<p>Not sure what the benchmark is, but <a href="http://www.odbody.com" rel="nofollow">we</a> see around 15% - 20% for our free site. However that's not for a plug-in.</p>

If you canâ€™t find the right drivers manually I would recommend just getting a software program that can do it for you. There is a program I use which will find drivers for just about all hardware devices. The best part is it takes a snapshot of your system specifications and matches the right driver to go with it.
