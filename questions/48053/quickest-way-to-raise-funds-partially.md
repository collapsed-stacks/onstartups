If the round is 500k but we need 50k today

What's the best way to structure this? (get some money transferred to our bank account/doesn't have to be the entire amount) Equity or convertible notes? 

we're an early stage tech startup

The answer depends on:

- whether you have a shareholder's agreement or not
- how expensive it is for you to get legal paperwork done
- how easy a share pricing conversation is/how much you trust each other

The simplest is to just sell shares. That takes paperwork so easy you can almost write it yourself. It also protects you as a common shareholder. This assumes you have a shareholder's agreement, which is nice (though not strictly essential) to have before you take in a new investor. As a point of goodwill, you might agree with the investor if the price of the $500K is less than the $50K price per share that you will give the investor the break.

If deal legal paperwork is cheap to get done, the share pricing conversation is not easy and/or the investor is untrusting, then a convertible debenture gives the investor more protection, including price protection.

In most cases my recommendation would be to do the shares. It depends a bit on the side of the table you sit on.

Are the rest of 500k lined up already? If so then I would recommend to take a look at bridge loan. In the case, if 500k is what you want to get (but doesn't have anything ready to close) then equity or convertible notes are good option.
