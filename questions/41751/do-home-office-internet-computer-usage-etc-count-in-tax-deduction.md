I am a sole Proprietorship in California. Where can I find a list of acceptable or not acceptable business expenses I am allowed to deduct from my income. Do I need to reimburse myself in anyway before reporting expenses?

It's called the ["Home Office Deduction."](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Home-Office-Deduction) It's based on the percentage of square footage in your home that you use exclusively for business.  Use [IRS Form 8829](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8829.pdf) to claim it, or let your tax accountant plug in the numbers for you when she does your return; her tax software will make the calculations and generate the necessary paperwork automatically.
