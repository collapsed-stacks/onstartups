I am a software architect, have been working hands-on on storage softwares for last 10+ years. All I know at the moment is, the problem, and the software solution to it.

Appreciate your help in making decisions on several factors.. like:

- Would there be a need of a co-founder?

- How do I accomplish all the legal formalities (based in India)?

- How do I decide whether to develop it on Windows or go for Open-Source (personally I'm a big fan of and believer in Open-Source)

- How to setup the marketing strategies?

- How do I approach VCs?

In short if you could give me a recipe, that would be a great help for me.

**If only it were that simple!** The questions you are asking are good - some have a definite answer, some are "it depends of a lot of things" (say, do you need a co-founder).

Step back a moment. 

The recipe you need looks more like this:

 - Define a question. ("How do I accomplish all the legal formalities?"). The more precise the question, the better the answer will be
   
 -  Define what the answer will look like. (Do x, y, and z). What's the deliverable?

 - Since one of the things that is absolutely key is making decisions, (Open Source or not?), decide on a methodology to use on the tough decisions (at a minimum, a list of pros and a list of cons will help clarify).
 - Go get the information that bridges your question to an answer that is right for you. That's everything from here, books, YouTube, blogs, meetups of starters, etc.
 - Repeat.

I totally agree with the first response.

There is one thing that separates those who know what needs to be done and how to do it from real world entrepreneurs - DRIVE. There isn't a software engineer on the planet who hasn't had a great idea for a new product or company. In my 20 years of developing software I had dozens and dozens of those. But only now, I am beginning to find the drive to actually DO something about it.

The accounting, business establishment are a concern, but as far as where you are, they are future  concerns. The question to ask yourself is whether you're prepared to begin DOING and not just dreaming. If the answer is yes, then your first, second and third stops are reading. The rest will come if it's meant to.

Good luck.
