Are there any good and short agreements document for founders? (not investors)

Focusing on:

1. Responsibility, e.g. hours of work (some of them may not be fulltime)
2. Vesting period


Any hints?

The one I have used contains the following sections:

* Parties entering into the agreement (e.g. you and your co-founder)
* What each party brings to the venture (e.g. patents, code, etc.)
* Any initial equity investment amounts
* What that equity investment gets
* Minium hours per week or month dedicated to the venture
* Salary for those hours (Don't put in anything about deferred payment or anything like that).
* Initial founders share grant or ownership percentage
* Title and job description
* Exit clause (e.g. what happens if they leave)
* All intellectual property generated will be owned by the new company
* Agreement timeframe (e.g. how long to either do a new agreement or found the company)
* Dispute resolution (e.g. binding arbitration, court, etc.)
* Governing law (e.g. what laws will apply. Like California, Santa Clara County).

This is just what I have used in the past. You should really talk to a lawyer about what else could be in something like this. You may want to draft an initial document and then send it to a lawyer for review.
