I'm just in a really weird situation, I hope you guys can help me with this. 

I have a company in Mexico, we do web design and stuff .. this project (from a USA 50+ guy) was kinda special and I assist it like a freelancer (not by my company).

First I got a $500 US deposit into my USA Bank of America account, I started the work with that doing a couple of pages for the client. 

Then he started to ask for a lot of meet-ups then about being part of the company (you know, that kind of client who will pay you once the site bring him money ...), then I got another deposit for $1,000 US to do more work ... this one was 60% complete in my part, I stopped working then. 

Reason? .. another person send me a message with a letter signed by him, I just realized the kind of horrible person he is, he was talking unpleasantly of me and a lady we both met in a couple of dinners, that really annoyed me so I started ignoring his calls.

He have money, so those $1,000 are not much for him but now he send me an email where he says he will sue me but I'm in Mexico, I'm not a USA citizen, I didn't sign any contract either but his friend is a lawyer, he said he will call immigrants or something. 

Now, my concern its that I'm in Mexico-USA Border and maybe he can call border police or something to tell me not to pass to USA any more? .. I have a B1 (tourist) visa. 

Thanks for your help :)!.

## Be professional

Depending on your ability to handle such pressure, refund the guy completely, or finish the job.

**After**, ignore him. You **can** choose your customers.

I did both in the past, and I have a preference for full refund. But if you really need money, finish the work. You will have the honors of doing it till the end, even if you finally decide to give him his $1500 back.

In fact, I wouldn't want a penny from an unsatisfied customer. Regardless what happened.

So you took the money but didn't finish the work, is that correct? 
If so then your either obilged to finish the work or return the money. Stopping half way for what ever reason wasn't part of the original deal.

Business and legally the personal relationship between him, you and a girl is a seperate matter entirely ...

As for "can he sue you in Mexico", I'm guessing he can given the trade deals between the countries but I don't know.

BUT ... I'm not a lawyer and its at the point where you should be talking to one.

As a designer, it is extremely important that you have detailed contracts signed by you and your client before you start work. Contracts will help protect you from such a situation in the future.

I can't comment on the legal part because I'm not a lawyer. However, ethically, you should either refund the money or finish the job because you are the one who decided to cease working,

Well. u still have an option to finish the rest of the 40% work and get yourself out of any risks. You will then have nothing to worry.

Depending on what you have worked out verbally or through email, you might be ok keeping the money. Most designers require a down payment and if they do half of the work and something goes bad... well they still did half of the work. If a plumber came to your house, took on a big job, spent hours and replaced parts etc, but did not finish you could get away with not paying him? As long as you can hand off your work to him in a way that someone else can pick up from where you left off and finish, there shouldn't be a problem with this. It all really depends on what you agreed on as well. If he did something deplorable, then he gave reason to sever ties and it's his fault.

Then again, if you are that close to being finished, finish it up if you can, no matter how much you hate the guy. You came this far already...
