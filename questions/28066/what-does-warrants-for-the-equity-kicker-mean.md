I was reading an article in a VC's blog and I found this explanation about venture debt:

"The terms are usually three years, interest only, balloon payment, with warrants for the equity kicker."

Can you explain the 'warrants for the equity kicker' part?

*Warrants* are the right to buy stock at a fixed price until it expires.

An *equity kicker* is a special bonus part of a loan that gives someone who loans money to a company (as debt) an extra bonus right to purchase shares in the company.

So the sentence, in plain English, would be:

* The terms of a *venture debt* loan are as follows:

  * The loan is for three years.
  * It is an interest only loan, which means that each month, only the interest on the loan is due... you do not pay back any part of the principle.
  * It has a balloon payment, which means that at the end of the three years, the entire principle must be paid back all at once.
  * To make the loan a better deal for the lender, the lender will have the right to purchase some shares of stock in the company at a fixed, pre-agreed upon price.

     * This part is done by issuing *warrants*, the right to buy a certain amount of stock in the company at a certain price within a certain price range.
