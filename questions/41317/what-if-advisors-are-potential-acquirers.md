I am drafting out a list of potential advisors to approach, but I'm realizing that some of the ones with the best fit in domain experience could also be in a position to acquire the company once it matures.

Is this a good thing, or does it lead to a conflict of interest I should be aware of?

You want that option.  You should look for advisors that see the benefit of your solution and can help you tweak it to fit the needs of their and other businessess.  They also have networks that can be of value to you.  It's ok if an advisor turns into a board member, or even a customer at some point in the future.  You can change your advisors around if you need to.
