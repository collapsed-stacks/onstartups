I run a small startup in India and we're using Outlook 2010 for email. We're currently using a US-based top-tier hosted-exchange (exchange 2010) provider but wish to switch to one that has India/Asia data centers. Our current provider's speeds are quite slow during US business hours and the reason (after extensive troubleshooting) appears to be because their servers are in the US and we're in India. Or at least that's what our provider claims, though I don't fully buy it.

We don't wish to use Google apps because it's said to not work well with Outlook and I wish to stick to Outlook for certain reasons, unless my search here is fruitless.

I've searched extensively online and found many providers who provide services to asia, but their hosted exchange offerings are located out of the US.

Can someone recommend a top-tier hosted exchange provider who preferably has India data centers, or at least Asia servers? Not very budget-conscious, as long as the provider has top-notch uptime and speeds. Need 10 mailboxes to start with, to increase gradually every quarter.

A quick search for MS Exchange hosting services in India yielded:

* [Net4](http://www.net4.in/aspx/businessApps/businessApps.aspx)

There are a few others providing hosting but they either don't say where the data centers are or say they are georedundant Microsoft Datacenters.
