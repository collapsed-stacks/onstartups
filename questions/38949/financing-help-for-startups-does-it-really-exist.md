I am secure seed money for my business and I'm running into all types of roadblocks from traditional banks. Is there ANY honest resources for startups, who don't require you to run a marathon to secure the funding?   Thanks!!

Reliable? No.

Simply put, anyone who is willing to give money to a high-risk business (and all startups fall into this category) is going to want to reduce that risk as much as possible. This means requiring the founders to document what they're doing - to make sure any funds are being spent well and have a maximum likelihood of turning profitable.

At a minimum, you will need to have a business plan, but more than that - demonstrate that you know what to do with any money that might be entrusted to you. To get to that point, you'll have to run the obstacle course.
