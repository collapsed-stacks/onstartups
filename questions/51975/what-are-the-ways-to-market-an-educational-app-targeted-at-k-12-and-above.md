<p>Utilize popular marketing techniques to reach this audience. In order to know what is popular, you need to either speak to the students themselves or speak to other companies advertising to students.</p>

<p>I would think that social media is a good place to start finding students who may be interested in the app. Find friends of friends that are students through social media and get them as beta testers for the app. You need it to be production-ready before you consider bigger marketing techniques that require money.</p>
