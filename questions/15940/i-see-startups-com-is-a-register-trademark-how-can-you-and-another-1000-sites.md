## I see startups.com is a register trademark, how can you and another +1000 sites use the term startups on their domain?

if you go to statups.com has a TM sign on their name which means that it is trademark registered. How is it possible so many other websites use the term "startups" without a problem ?

They trademarked that specific design and perhaps the word with .com in it. In their case it is characterized by a bluish color and the ".com" on the bottom right. No one can claim an exclusive right to the word "startup" because it is a common word. For more details see: http://businessknowhow.com/startup/trademark-mistakes.htm

Your legal results may vary, but trademarking a domain (startups.com) and a word (startups) are two different things.  

http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/resources/exam/guide299.jsp describes the process behind trademarking the domain as a unique mark, which is easier than attempting to trademark the word **startups** and trying to maintain its validity based on the concept of "distinct character" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_distinctiveness 

I would maintain that startups is a generic term and would be unenforceable, while startup.com could be an enforceable service / trademark.
