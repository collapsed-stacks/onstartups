If I know a startup has a valuation of $X million pre-money, received $Y million from VC and is now evaluated at $X+Y millions, how much percentage of the company were given to the VC?

And if, say, 20% have gone to VC, 20% more are in the employee stock pool, does that mean the 3 others founds have 20% each? Or are the shares "on hold" usually for some reason?

<p>You can't quite calculate that from the numbers you have. If the company was worth X, then investors added Y in cash, then just after the transaction completes the company is worth X+Y, as you write. That's because one dollar in cash is included in the valuation as .. one dollar.</p>

<p>This doesn't give you absolute certainty about the ownership percentages; these were determined by (confidential) negotiation. Depending on the relative strength and the intentions of the negotiating parties, the investors could take home a larger or smaller ownership share for their investment.</p>

<p>Having said that, the investors will generally take (Y/(X+Y))*100 percent ownership. <a href="http://www.askventure.com/pre-post-money-valuation-calculation-venture-capital.html" rel="nofollow">Here is an article that explains the calculation</a> (note that ESOP means "Employee Stock Options Pool"). Also see this <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/843/deal-terminology-3m-on-3m" rel="nofollow">previous question</a>.</p>

<p>I guess that investors in later stages would always follow the formula linked above -- if people deviate from it, then it's probably in the very early stages of a company, where valuations are quite uncertain anyways.</p>

<p>The 3 founders could have 20 percent each. Or they could have a different split; if they began with different ownership percentages (any split is possible). They could also have "<a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/05/term-sheet-vesting.html" rel="nofollow">vesting</a>", a sort of earn-your-shares-over-time, which could mean that they don't own all of their allotted shares yet.</p>
