Is there a free resource that I can use other than alexa.com?

Most times, people are sending traffic to a website with a link.
So with a little luck you're competitor has just a few backlinks.
If you know your competitor well, it shouldn't be that hard to find
out which backlink is giving your competitor all the traffic.

Just go to google and type:
link:www.competitorsdomain.com

Also go to yahoo and do the same because Google isn't showing all backlinks.

Good luck!

What Dennis said, with one more detail.

If you search for "link:www.competitor.com", google will only show pages linking to exactly this page.

If you search for "link:www.competitor.com*", google will show pages linking to any page on www.competitor.com.

Also, Yahoo's site explorer (http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com) is useful to discover backlinks to any site.
