If there is click fraud or other abuse of the Google terms and conditions, you are out of luck. If you feel this was a mistake and you didn't do anything wrong, you can appeal the decision at http://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/request.py?hl=en&contact_type=appeal_form&rd=1

Marth is completely correct.  If Google then decides to reject your appeal there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.

I believe this is happening more and more. We had exactly the same thing happen to our basketball clubs site (Putney Basketball). Out of the blue google cut off the account right when they were due to pay. The money was small but I think it shows that you should be very careful about what services you use from them.

Update:
We appealed as instructed (you should do this). We were advised after a week or so that Google would reinstate the account. They make very clear that is the end of the road.
