I am looking into building a social media tool and would be curious to know what the entrepreneurs here are missing.

Is there one information (raw data, aggregated data, chart, etc) that would help you?

To arrive at ideas you should consider what a person can use a social network for in real life in order to solve problems or fill needs. Such problems and needs include the following:

 - Gaining know-who, as opposed to having know-how, and know-what (facts)
 - Establishing a favorable social identity and gaining social status
 - Security, especially in countries where there is little reliance on the government to help out in cases of trouble

Then you can think about, how technology could help to facilitate such social exchanges.

In general, I can say that I believe there is a huge potential in this, and I do have two specific ideas, but they are too good to publish here.
