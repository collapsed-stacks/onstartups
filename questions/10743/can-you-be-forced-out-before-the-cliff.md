If your founder's contract has a "cliff", can the other founders decide to force you out before that cliff or do you have to quit to lose all your equity?

Hope this intro for vesting help a little bit. 
It all depends on the contract you all agreed on.

It all depends on your contract. The company can decide to let you go at anytime if the state you are in is an "at will" state. If the contact says that you have to be employed with the company for a specific amount of time and their is no provision for early termination, then you are out of luck.

It's bad form to force out a founder. Usually, people try and figure an equitable way to resolve any issues since that's just the right thing to do.

You haven't provided enough information for anyone to provide a helpful answer.

I'm guessing that the "founder's contract" is some form of shareholder agreement. One would need to examine that agreement, and any other agreements that may be in place, do know what your rights are.

Typically a contract will include a "constructive termination" clause which details the circumstances in which you were essentially forced to quit.

For example, a company that relocates an office more than 50 miles from the original location also essentially forces you to move; if you decide not to move, you'd normally say they "let you go" rather than "you left."  However technically they didn't fire you, so this would be an example of constructive termination.

However usually CT needs to be stated in the contract.  You can argue otherwise, and if the "forced out" is blatant you might have a case, but typically something like that is too nebulous to argue about.

If they're not violating the contract, you're probably SOL.  You're certainly SOL until you ask a lawyer.
