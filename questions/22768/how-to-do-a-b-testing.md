Is there a free way to do quality a/b testing in an efficient and helpful manner?

Are there any sites that are known to be the best and most helpful in this?

<p>Entirely free is <a href="http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer/" rel="nofollow">Google Website Optimizer</a> which is pretty quick to get going with, but also pretty comprehensive.  There's a couple of books available from Amazon if you should need them, and quite a few sites out there giving hints on it.  As far as I know it's the only free one, but does full multi goal multi-variate testing, albeit not with realtime results.</p>

<p>There's a website which lists all the known multi-variate tools and compares them here: <a href="http://www.whichmvt.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whichmvt.com/</a></p>

<p>You can get 30 day free trials from both <a href="http://www.optimizely.com/" rel="nofollow">Optimizely</a> and <a href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/" rel="nofollow">VisualWebsiteOptimizer</a></p>

<p>I've been using VWO and am very pleased.  Both look like they should do what you need.  I'm not aware of any sites that offer A/B testing of that quality for no cost- we'll see what others say.</p>

Check out http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/ I am using it since last week. The set up is very easy and intuitive and support is awesome, at times you may get answer within 2-3 mins of sending an email.

Unlike GA it provides real time reporting which is a boon when you are in midst of huge incoming traffic.
