A couple questions have been asked on similar topics.  I would like specifically to know if anyone has any thoughts specifically on LeanStartupMachine weekends.

Also, more generally, we are nearly done already building our prototype and closing in on finishing our business plan.  Our next step is to reach out for feedback from potential customers and ultimately to outside investors. I am wondering what we would get out of any startup weekend at this stage.

I think it is possible we could get feedback/consulting help on the project, and maybe find a person who could be our in-house tech person (prototype is outsourced).

On the other hand, reading some of the posts here, I am now more concerned that exposing our entire concept/business plan for the purpose of getting feedback from other entrepreneurs whom we know nothing about except that they are looking for their own ideas could pose significant risks.

I welcome any thoughts.

<p>If you go to one of those weekends, next time you would have "reached out for feedback from potential customers" <strong>before</strong> being "nearly done building your prototype".</p>

<p>So it's probably worth it. There is close to zero risk that other entrepreneurs will think you are so <a href="http://blog.foundrs.com/2009/03/11/the-great-startup-idea-that-i-cant-reveal-yet/" rel="nofollow">amazingly awesome that they'll drop their own ideas and start copying you</a>.</p>
