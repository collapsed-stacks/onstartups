I'm a qualified software engineer and I've been reading some articles about start ups.

- [Y combinator Coming up with Start Up Ideas](http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/y-combinator-paul-graham-coming-up-with-start-up-ideas.html)
- [How to get start up ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)
- [12 Rules For Building Your First Profitable Startup](http://www.layeredthoughts.com/startups/12-rules-for-building-your-first-profitable-startup)

So my question is when it comes to making a start-up all these different websites refer to the fact that it is `"okay to have competitors"`. My question is how many successful start ups? start with a singular developer with large already situated competitors?

It's perfectly okay to have competitors. In fact, you should think extra hard about your idea if it doesn't look like there are any competitors out there. Maybe you're the first one, but probably not.

There's plenty of startups that had competitors when they bootstrapped. Air B&B had couchsurfing, Thumbtack had Angie's list and Red Beacon.

And Facebook had MySpace.
