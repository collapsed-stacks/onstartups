I made some money over a new startup and I would like to invest a part of it into someone else's startup.

I found it through an online university competition and I would like to know more information about their business plan.
The problem is that I do not know them and do not know how to properly request their business plan.

Something that I am afraid of is the fact that I do not have any funding history and this is my first attempt to fund someone. Maybe this makes me kind of a "liar".

So, is there a proper way, a template to follow for my purpose?

Just talk to them.

But perhaps after you've checked the regulations on financial investment in your country.

Traditional business plans get quickly outdated and are useless. 

If you want to invest in them let them know your interest and meet the entrepreneurs. Talk.

Not really. Maybe just offer them an NDA first to give them some assurance that you will do nothing with the information other than consider them for investment.
