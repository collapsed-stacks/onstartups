I am a recent graduate and soon I am starting my own company in the IT/Tech. Because always all of my studies were mostly technical(computer programming,coding,...) and do not have that much work experience I am completely ignorant about certain terminologies in finance. For example gross salary,net salary,turn over, financial year and so on. The thing is that most of the time I am not aware  of the existence of such terminologies. Do you know of any books that talks about these things? Maybe bookkeeping would be a better word. Also some books that help organizing a company for a complete newbie is good to read?
thanks

You might benefit from:

 - *Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality* by Bob Walsh
 - *Eric Sink on the Business of Software*
 - some introductory accounting books or an accounting course

You should also know that starting and operating a company is not just a very different skillset, but a rather different frame of mind, from programming. You can certainly learn all the terminology and legal processes, but if your goal is to make a successful company, the most important thing to hone may be your network, and your ability to find people with strengths that complement your own, and convince those people to work with you. Depending on the company, there will be challenges in marketing, sales, support, financing, and other areas as well as product development.
