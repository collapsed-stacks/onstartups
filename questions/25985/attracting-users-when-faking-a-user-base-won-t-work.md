## Attracting users when faking a user-base won't work

Having recently (as in the past week) launched a website with an interesting product, I was looking into various ways of promoting the site to grow its user-base. The site has been pushed out to the personal networks of the various people involved in the project, which we anticipate will bring in about half the people needed to reach critical mass.

Content is not generated by the users for the primary functions of the site (though there is a forum that we hope to see activity on), so content generation is not the issue. SEO is also not an issue - within 3 days of launch, the site was being indexed for the keywords we were targeting and resulting in a small number of hits. 

What methods which do not involve fake accounts (not allowed by the rules governing the site as it's regulated) and reaching out to your network would people recommend?
