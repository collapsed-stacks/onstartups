I have a new business idea and am talking to consultants and potential employees. I would like to get these people under non-disclosure / non-competes.  However, both the other company and I reside in California, where non-competes are unenforceable.  Is there an alternative in California? Will incorporating elsewhere help?  Does the enforcability of a non-compete depend on my location, the counterparty's location, or the company's?

Incorporating elsewhere does not avoid California law if your business operations occur in California - you have to foreign register/qualify for business in CA anyways before legally doing business in CA if you incorporate out of state.

Also be wary of certain quirks in cross-state rulings:
From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause

<p>If the counterparty is in CA, CA courts will not enforce non-compete provisions (subject to certain exceptions). Please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/05/13/choice-of-law-and-non-compete-provisions/" rel="nofollow">Choice-of-Law and Non-Compete Provisions</a>.</p>

<p>What you can include in your NDA, however, are (a) acknowledgement that the confidential information constitutes your trade secret and (b) a provision stating that the counterparty may not use the confidential information for any purpose other than a business relationship with you.</p>
