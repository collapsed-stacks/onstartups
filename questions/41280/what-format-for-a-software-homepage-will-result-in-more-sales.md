Currently reviewing two types of homepages for software products:

- **Stylish with minimum content on the homepage:** boxshot, download button, buy now button and sometimes features listed as small snippets which on click will lead to other pages.

- **Majority content on the homepage:** A long scrolling page with the majority of the website's content including in-depth explanations of all features, boxshot, download button, buy now button, etc.

What format for a software homepage will result in more sells?

I think it depends entirely on the complexity of the software (& the target market)

If it is say a DVD burning software I just want a good looking site, a download/buy button, a quick list of key features (and links to more detailed info)...

However if it is a professional Database tool... I likely want to spend a good 20-30 minutes reviewing all the details before considering a purchase.

I will say though in either case if there is a free/evaluation/trial version be sure to add a big, visible, obvious download button! Don't put any roadblocks up for a user to try your software... If they use it and love it... That's the best "proof" the software is what they want... Now the only question is price ;-)

I suggest designing both styles and running A/B tests to see the difference.
