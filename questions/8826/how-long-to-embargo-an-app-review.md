I'm nearing version 1 for my first iPhone app.  I've never done this before and I'm trying to plan the release.

I expect a few days (if I'm lucky) in the App Store review process. Afterwards, I plan to hit up all the bloggers, reporters, etc. I have been able to uncover in hopes of them reviewing the app.

As I understand this, reporters prefer "new", to a product that has been covered elsewhere. I think I need to provide an "embargo" which allows reporters to write a story and not get scooped by anyone else (yes, I realize reporters may not care a jot about my app). 

How long should the embargo last?  Should I tell them, "you can have the app today, but it's embargoed (and you can't write on it) for one week"?  I prefer the smallest period possible.

Embargos for such small apps are typically one week or less. But understand that if you don't give at least two days notice, the bloggers won't have time to actually write it.

Unless you are the next Google, it's already hard enough to get reviewers to talk about your app, so make it as easy for them as possible.
