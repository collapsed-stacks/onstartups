I am planning to digitalizes my receipts, because manually keeping and filing them is taking a toll on me. I'm planning to get them scanned, or camera'ed into PDF/image files and store them somewhere on the cloud.

The issue is, is it acceptable to produce a scanned document for the income tax examination purpose?

That will probably depend on the country. In New Zealand, for example, you need to store receipts in their original form. If you got a paper receipt, you need to store that, but if you bought something on the Internet and got a digital receipt then a digital copy is ok.
