## Does Anyone Have Good Examples of "After the Fact" Pitch Decks?

I know that no one in there right mind would circulate a deck publicly while they were out pitching their company. However, it would seem that a deck from a successful round 5 or 10 years ago would be fairly safe to share. For instance, I think you could probably share Mint.com's deck from their original funding round (just as an example) without much damage to Mint/Intuit.

This would seem to be a huge win for entrepreneurs if we could look through pitch decks from companies that have received funding. Anyone know of any sources of these? I do recall seeing Mark Cuban's Broadcast decks from his IPO road shows and those were pretty helpful.

Any other suggestions?

<p>I don't have any decks handy but Guy Kawasaki's "Art of the Start" does a pretty good job explaining how the deck should look. I also wrote a post on this based on my experience. You can check it out <a href="http://www.thedailymba.com/2009/05/27/pitch-perfect/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This outline seems to work for us.</p>
