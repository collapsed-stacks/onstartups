I'm beginning fundraising for my brick & mortar textbook rental company. My best high concept pitch is "Blockbuster for textbooks". I need some feedback on how this rubs people, seeing that Blockbuster isn't doing very well. Any feedback is much appreciated.

<p>Given that Blockbuster is one of the 10 included in this "<a href="http://247wallst.com/2009/12/02/the-ten-brands-that-will-disappear-in-2010/" rel="nofollow">ten brands that will disappear in 2010</a>" article, I would suggest using "<strong>netflix for textbooks</strong>" or a "one uppie type phrase" on Chegg.</p>

<p>The real issue here is that you're limiting yourself severely by being a brick &amp; mortar store. </p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.nacs.org/public/research/higher%5Fed%5Fretail.asp" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, the average student in 2008 spent $750 on his/her books, of which an average of 64% was spent at their college bookstore. It's local, it's easy to return to (if they drop a class), and they can sell back last year's books for credit for this year. If you're trying to become a brick &amp; mortar rental location, this is what you're up against.</p>

<p>One real problem is locations; in the Boston area alone, there are more than 100 colleges and universities. These are close enough that they could all go to a single store location if necessary, but distant enough that it would be difficult - and a hassle - to do so, rather than go to their local bookstore. Are you going to be in 20 locations in Boston alone? Are you going to just focus on one college at first, then try to expand?</p>

<p>Another problem is competition from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rent+textbooks" rel="nofollow">online textbook rental</a> / sales companies. These companies are already established, have the stock, and are eating into college bookstores' shares - albeit slowly. It would be hard for you to go up against them with their infrastructure. </p>

<p>Consider the problem you are trying to solve, and research who is trying to solve the problem already. If you don't think you can do it better than they're already doing it, you might want to consider trying to solve a new problem, or at least finding a new solution to this one.</p>

<p>Good luck,
 - Josh</p>

<p>I'm surprised it took Amazon this long to jump into this game, but I believe they recently have jumped fully into the new/used textbook game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Used-Textbooks-Books/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=465600" rel="nofollow">competing head to head with university bookstores</a>.</p>

<p>Note, I'm not necessarily saying this invalidates your idea (on the contrary, it probably validates it) but you'll likely want to think about how to set yourself apart.  If it's going with the idea of "rental" rather than "purchase and then sell back", then go with Netflix as @jimg suggested.</p>

I agree with Jimg. You do not want to associate yourself with a dying brand like Blockbuster. In fact, I would try and get away from comparing it to anything per se. Instead, try and capture (as Guy Kawasaki puts it) a mantra for your business. This will have more power than comparing it to another brand. Some ideas to consider:

 - Democratizing Education
 - Renewable Learning
 - Students First
 - Share the Knowledge
 - Sustaining Educational Knowledge

You should brainstorm with your team and come up with (clearly) something better. I can see that some VC's might still associate your idea with other brands so be prepared for that.
