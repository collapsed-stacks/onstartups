What options do I have besides using a shared host or setting up my own Wordpress instance? 

I want a service that I can rely, that can scale when needed and provide a good support.

Please advice.

Thanks

<p>The simplest solutions I know if you don't want to worry about maintenance are <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">WordPress.com</a> and <a href="http://wpengine.com/" rel="nofollow">WP Engine</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">WordPress.com</a> starts at the nice round figure of free, with premium features typically costing in at a few dollars a month. You don't get anything like the flexibility of your own private instance, but if your need is close to the core, it's a very easy experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://wpengine.com/" rel="nofollow">WP Engine</a> starts out at $49 a month, gives you far greater access to plugins etc, and offers some very nice features such as a staging environment to try out changes. </p>

<p>Finally, some commodity hosts do a great job in delivering WordPress installations that give you the bare minimum of admin. <a href="http://wordpress.org/hosting/" rel="nofollow">This link on WordPress.org</a> lists a few they recommend, or you can scan the forums, <a href="http://wordpress.org/search/recommend+host?forums=1" rel="nofollow">starting here</a>. </p>
