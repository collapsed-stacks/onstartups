Before I go ahead on put much effort into a startup idea I have, I wanted to know if anyone could direct me to legal resources/opinions on using ideas developed while consulting for a company as the basis for a new company.

The idea in mind (a simple project tracking utility) is generic enough so that:

 - there are likely many variants of it in existence anyway
 - has nothing to do with the core business of the original company and is not proprietary (basically it was a utility to help them get work done, not anything to do with the work getting done)
 - nothing related to the idea is patented or trademarked
 - no code or other work product would be re-used, just one of the ideas would be reworked to make a new product

I basically want to take a project management utility developed while at one company, "generify" and simplify it for use by any company.

Of course, I will consult a lawyer before getting serious about this - but just seeing if anyone out there has experience with this kind of situation....

I'm not sure you client will agree that you make money on work you made for him and for which you have been paid. **You should check that with your client before continuing**.

If you don't care about ethics at all, **check the contract** you have signed with him. There are lot of chances that all ownership of the work you did during consultancy has been automatically assigned to your client.

No one can provide a definitive answer to your question without examining the agreement between you and your client to determine who has which rights to what.
