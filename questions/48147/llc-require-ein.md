I have an LLC that will be a passthru entity (sole owner). 

 - Is such an entity required to have an EIN to do business? 
 - If not, how would you get banking accounts, LoC, etc without an EIN to legally shelter and conduct business as an LLC and devolve it into a Sole Proprietorship?

No, LLC doesn't require EIN if you don't have employees.

You **can** get an EIN in order to open a bank account, if the bank requires it, but you're not legally required to have it. From tax perspective, single-member LLC **is** sole proprietorship.
