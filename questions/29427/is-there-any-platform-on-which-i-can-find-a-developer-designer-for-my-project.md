Is there any platform where we can find developer/designer or where designer and developers collaborate and contribute. There are lot of website where this things happens but they are much like a bulletin board, what I am looking for is a platform which can ease in discovering developers designers who are willing to collaborate. I don't want to find a cofounder, or a lead, I just want to collect bunch of people and start working on the idea just like you do in a hackathon.

IRC.
Drupal, .NET, Ruby - all kinds of hangouts for different groups of people making cool things everyday.

Check collaborators on successful github.com projects.  There are lots of linkedin.com groups too

<p>The only thing that sounds similar to this that I am aware of is <a href="http://startupweekend.org/" rel="nofollow">startupweekend</a>. I think the team that helps you gets a cut of the equity though if you are able to build a business. </p>

<p>Assuming nothing like this exists, sounds like a good online social business idea.</p>
