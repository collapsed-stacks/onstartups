We have a pretty static site on godaddy right now.  I NEED to get off godaddy. 

We use wordpress for the website and I have the following requirements:

- we will publish our desktopserver app to the host after every build for users to download. (I want to publish with scp or sftp and allow anonymous downloads)

- we want to supply screencasts or video tutorials on the website

- we will also have document downloads.

I don't expect that we will have huge amounts of traffic, but what kind of hosting and what suggestions for vendors do people have?

Thanks

<p>Tim - I had to get my Wordpress-based site off GoDaddy as it became slow and unreliable.  I looked around and found these guys were highly recommended: <strong><a href="http://www.fusednetwork.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fusednetwork.com/</a></strong>.  </p>

<p>Their prices are very reasonable and they moved my Wordpress site for me at no extra charge.  They seem to know Wordpress pretty well and I have found their support to be outstanding.</p>

<p>The only down-side for me is that they only host Linux boxes (as that is their specialism), so if you need to do any Windows stuff, you will have to host it separately.  Otherwise I have no complaints and I think they'll tell you straight whether they can handle your requirements.  (I have no affiliation, btw).</p>

<p>HTH.</p>

There are a number of hosts out there and we have our own dedicated server, so I can't give you a suggestion.

However, I'd advise you to host videos on a CDN or even on YouTube, as with videos you surely exhaust your bandwidth in no time. There are also a number of commercial video hosting services you can consider.

I have used Hostgator for a few years now and they have been wonderful.  I had issues at 3am and they were available for live chat to get everything resolved immediately.  $8-$12 per month and absolutely worth it.

I recommend Vimeo to host the videos, since they have a nice interface and display crisp videos when you embed them on your site.  You will also probably get a bit of traffic from people who see your videos on Vimeo.

You've already gotten some great answers Tim. As you can see there are lots of alternatives available for you.  I'd also like to chime in with the Microsoft Online Services option, subscriptions start at as little as 10 dollars a month, and you don't have to worry about bandwith.  You can also create a unique domain name and email address (i.e. Tim@timswidgets.com) 

If you want to see a demo of the services available, I'll add a link at the bottom.  Whatever you end up choosing, you're correct that you need a reliable quality site.  Best of luck to you!
