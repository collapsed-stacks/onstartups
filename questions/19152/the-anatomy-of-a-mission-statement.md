I'm looking for any tips or suggestions for helping develop my business's mission statement.  I'm a bit confused on what *exactly* a mission statement is...

 - What is a mission statement composed of?
 - How should I look at or break down my goals to fit this?
 - Is there anything else I should look at besides my company goals?
 - Is there anything a mission statement should **not** be?

I agree with Guy Kawasaki on this.  Have mantra, not mission statements.
