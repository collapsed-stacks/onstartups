<p>A couple of time I heard about people quite interesting by entrepreneurship, but not sure of themselves. They have no strong design or technical backgrounds and they don't necessarily feel skilled in any "core startup needs".</p>

<p>I've never experienced any startup week-end myself, and I'm still doubtful on whether it could be relevant for those people to get involve in a startup week-end?</p>

<p>Should those doubt be seen as a lack of practice? Or as a lack of cultural match with the startup world?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I've been there, with my doubtful friend. I can describe how awesome it was. Most (maybe all) of the ideas weren't good, but we've met great people and worked in a way we never did before with complete strangers, struggling to get the best of us for a week-end.</p>

<p>There's no good reason to not go there if you are interested in entrepreneurship. Even if you have a business running, even if you are shy (nobody is forced to talk publicly), even if you have no hard skills nor startup related skills. Go there, at least once, you'll learn something.</p>

<p>I learnt so much from these weekends both about start-up culture, business and a good insight into my own skills and weaknesses.</p>

<p>You don't need strong technical skills to get involved in the weekend. These weekends are not about hacking the next facebook nor are they about designing the next mona lisa. They are about coming together with some random people you've never met creating something that might have some potential to become something.</p>

<p>It is a great way to learn about yourself, enhance your understanding of start-up culture and network with people who share similar interests to you.</p>
