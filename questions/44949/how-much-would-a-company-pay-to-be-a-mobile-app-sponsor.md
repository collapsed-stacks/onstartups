Nearing the end of our mobile application development, we are looking to get some initial funding in the form of a sponsorship.  Our application would hit both iPhone and Android app stores. The funding would be used mostly for continued marketing and initial app launch.

The application is targeted at a specific market where our prospective sponsors are in, our thoughts are splash screen branding, main screen branding, and a menu icon with a customized view for their product / brand in a not so annoying way to the user.  They would gain value by promoting their brand in our app space as while the users are in the app, they would see the product before they go out to the places where they could purchase this product.  Like seeing an ad for skin care in a shopping app before you go shopping at the beauty store ( just an example here not the real product )

I know it depends on users , but since the app isn't launched yet that can't be in the equation.  We hope we will see a few 100k users over several months.

Trying to gauge what kind of value that has and what would be reasonable funding ?

It is unfortunate that you didn't think about all this stuff before you got to this stage, as you may have wasted your time.

In any case, it is impossible to give more than a "dartboard" estimate, as you haven't given enough information to judge how valuable your proposition would be. It could be a million dollars, or it could be fifty dollars. Who knows? Actually, you should.

I wish you luck, but really only you can answer this.
