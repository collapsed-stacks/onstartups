Unless you happen to hit the next Google or Facebook it's very unlikely that non-founders will make out on a startup so is it worth it for potential employees to consider equity when going over offers?  1% seems to be the "going rate" but after a few rounds of funding it's diluted so much that the company would have to sell for a ridiculous(200m+) amount for that to be worth it.

 - 1% is a lot of equity for a non-management employee who would typically get much less
 - Even an exit at $200M wouldn't give most employees that much.  A nice bonus but isn't going to buy you a house or make an earlier retirement.
 - You are right the the likelihood of return on equity is minuscule for most people.  If you have the option definitely go for a higher salary and less equity.
