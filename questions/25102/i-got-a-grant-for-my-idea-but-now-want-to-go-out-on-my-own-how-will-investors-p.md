## I got a grant for my idea but now want to go out on my own. How will investors perceive this?

I applied for a grant to create a website that will 'save the world'.  The grant-giving organization gave me a choice:  take the grant which would fund the first two months (hiring a web developer), or work for them.  

Working for them entails using THEIR web developer instead of my own and giving them ownership in exchange for continuous funding and the support of their team and the prestige of involvement with their organization.   

It's not working on many levels. So now I wish more than anything I'd taken that grant.  I'm considering asking them if I can reverse the decision.  I'm also seeking other seed money or pro bono or 'loan' web design in hopes to just do it on my own.  

So:  in seeking other funding sources, does my current situation stand testimony that this is a viable idea worth investing in?  Or is it a negative?  Does this count as 'received a grant' or how could this appear on resume / marketing materials?

**It really depends on the details of any sort of contract you signed**.  Or if there isn't one, any sort of written communication/agreement you had.  Or if there's none of that, any verbal agreement you had.  Go look through it again.  If the answer isn't obvious, you'll probably need to talk to a lawyer.  

It's possible you gave away the rights to the website when you started working for them, and you'll either need to give up on it and try something new (if it belongs to them) or possibly you can discuss it with them.  **A friendly, non-threatening discussion about how you feel about the current situation always goes a very long way.**
