It has been said that a business must grow or die. Many businesses start because someone knows how to do something and they start a company to do it. While expertise in their field is required to start, expertise in business strategy will be required to keep it going and growing. So what can someone do to move from subject matter expert to business strategist?

That is a great question.  I think I would start the same way my professor in grad school told me to start getting ready to write a thesis- by producing an "annotated bibliography".  That is, find the best books and articles on business strategy, and then just begin to summarize them.  Then I would just keep writing what you learn - a blog would be perfect for this.  Fake it until you make it.  Keep writing about business strategy and pretty soon you will become a business strategist.  You become what you do.

<p>I would recommend playing strategy games against human players. One game that I believe has taught me how to strategy during negotiations, is the game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_%28game%29" rel="nofollow">risk</a>. This game has also taught me general strategical thinking, which is relevant for business strategy. Another game is, of course, monopoly.</p>

<p>The reasons why I recommend playing games is that I consider strategical thinking more of a skill than knowledge.</p>
