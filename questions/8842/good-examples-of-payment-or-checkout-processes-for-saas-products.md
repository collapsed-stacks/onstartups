we run an online web application and for th last 6 months have processed payments thru Paypal. We have finally secured an international merchant account and are in the process of redesigning our Checkout/Pay process. We are looking for any good and effective Payment page designs and checkout flows that you might have come across in your travels on the web that we can use as inspiration for our own checkout.

We'd love it if you can share the link to the best checkout flow you've come across or the one you felt was simple, effective and a breeze to pay on.

(Let's leave Amazon out of this for now)
