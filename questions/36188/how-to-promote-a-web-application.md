Does anyone have any opinions on the best way to promote a web application aimed at developers? We have spent the last few months developing an application and it will be released some time this week.

The budget is quite tight so a large advertising spend is out of the question. I think promoting it on Social Networks may work and at the minute but I am unsure whether to focus on Twitter or Facebook.

One other area is affiliate advertising but I don't know of any networks that are aimed at the tech industry, these seem to focus more on the e-commerce industry.

<p>check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow</a> for questions that your app solves and offer it as an answer. If your app solves a large enough pain it will spread naturally.</p>

I was in a similar situation and after months of looking and tweaking my app and trying to get my first sale I realized that I was going about it all wrong to begin with. I spent a few months developing my app before I got any customer buy in and have spent months since playing catch up and its killing me. Since that time I slowed down and read a great book that has put all of this in perspective for me called Four Steps to the Epiphany by Steven Grey Blank which describes, in my opinion, the right way to attack the issue you are up against right now. 

I highly recommend reading that book before moving forward. 

Best of luck to you,

<p>I had the exactly the same problem. I could not solve it yet but here is my experience.</p>

<p>I would suggest <a href="http://dzone.com" rel="nofollow">dzone.com</a> which is often used for marketing and of course try to list your app in the proper place like <a href="http://stackapps.com">stackapps.com</a> if it is related with stackoverflow. </p>
