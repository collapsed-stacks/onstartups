I'm working on a project with a friend in Morocco, and we're planning on applying to a U.S. startup incubator (ycombinator) soon. My question is, what is the easiest way to get him into the U.S.? At minimum, he needs to be able to stay for 90 days.

I've researched some of the different types of Visa's, like the Startup Visa (EB-6), and the Visa Waiver Program, but unfortunately none apply to him/us. The Startup Visa bill, which I don't believe has even been passed yet, requires $250k in U.S. VC funding or $100K in Angel. As for the Visa Waiver Program, Morocco is not currently one of the participating countries.

Should we just get married and call it a day? Just kiiiiiding ;).

BTW, I'm a U.S. citizen, and I will provide him with a place to stay.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

The E2 visa may make for a good founder visa.  (not sure if Morocco citizens are elegible for it, though).
