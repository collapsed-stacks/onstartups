I would like to know if you guys have any tips on where someone can see for example, how's the *wine* market doing or the *toys* market doing world wide or US only.

I have been looking around but I can only find these expensive reports. 

Any tips?

I'll give you a quick and dirty way to do it. Go to Google Trends and type in the market you're looking for:

> http://www.google.com/trends

This will give you the result for toys in the US:

> http://www.google.com/trends?q=toys&geo=usa&sa=N

 - This will allow you to see how searches for your market are occurring over time
 - In this new internet age search is likely to play a massive role in your new business
 - This technique works best for larger markets where trend info is available
 - You can then research the market further by obtaining research analysis on it, usually at a price.

One obvious way is to look at key companies or competitors in the space and see how quickly or slowly their sales are growing. Of course, this is easier for publicly traded companies than for private firms.
