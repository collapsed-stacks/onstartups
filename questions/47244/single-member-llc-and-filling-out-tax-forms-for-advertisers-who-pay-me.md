I have accounts with various advertisers and affiliate companies - let's just say Amazon Affiliates for the purposes of this discussion - and I've now registered a single-member LLC.

During the conversion process from getting paid individually to getting paid as an LLC, I've run into a few issues I'm not 100% sure how to answer.

I have:

 - my own name
 - my single-member LLC name

I also have:

 - my own SSN
 - my own EIN (as a sole proprietor)
 - my LLC's EIN

I've been using my own EIN and my own name so far.


----------


So what should I use now:

 - for the *Tax Name* field
 - for the *Tax ID Number* field
 - for the *Organization Type* field

Curiously, the Organization Type doesn't even have an LLC-related field at all. Here's what it looks like:

According to various instructions, including ones in the W9, single-member LLCs are disregarded entities on the federal level. But my bank account is in the LLC's name. So in order to get paid, I imagine I need the Name to be the name of the LLC. What about the tax ID number? And the type? It's so very confusing.

Thank you.

<p>LLC name (or if they have a separate DBA field - your name, and the LLC in the DBA field).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Your SSN/EIN. From <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-W-9,-Request-for-Taxpayer-Identification-Number-and-Certification" rel="nofollow">form W9</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are a single-member LLC that is disregarded as an entity
  separate from its owner (see Limited Liability Company (LLC) on page
  2), enter the owner’s SSN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter
  the disregarded entity’s EIN. If the LLC is classified as a
  corporation or partnership, enter the entity’s EIN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, many use SMLLC EIN and it seems to be passing well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for the Organization Type field</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Individual if you're SMLLC, Partnership if you're MMLLC.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm not a lawyer and this is not a legal advice. I'm not a tax professional either, and this is not a tax advice as well. In a doubt go to a professional. Information you get on free forums is worth exactly what you paid for it.</p>
