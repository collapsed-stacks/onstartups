I am hoping to get suggestions to where it is possibly to get linked from and/or get your business listed for free?

I know of diystartups.com which is decent.  Any other suggestions?

Thanks,
Alex

@Tim makes a critical point here. There seems to be a bubble of activity around startups and services helping startups like all these sites listed. Frankly, the only people interested in reading these is more than not likely investors. So unless you're at a point you want to attract investors, I suggest focusing on your target customers for marketing.
