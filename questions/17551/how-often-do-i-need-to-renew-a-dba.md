I have googled to find an answer but all I was able to find was it is 5 years in CA and 10 years in TX.

I would like to learn it for SC, GA and FL.

And, is there a specific time to do this?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Here's the correct legal answer: five years, then it has to be renewed.

http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&group=17001-18000&file=17900-17930

17920.  (a) Unless the statement expires earlier under subdivision
(b) or (c), a fictitious business name statement expires **five years**
from the date it was filed in the office of the county clerk.
   (b) Except as provided in Section 17923, a fictitious business
name statement expires 40 days after any change in the facts set
forth in the statement pursuant to Section 17913, except that a
change in the residence address of an individual, general partner, or
trustee does not cause the statement to expire.

In California a DBA ('Doing Business As') is issued and recognized when a local city government issues a business license to conduct business in that city. The license is renewed each quarter with a fee (In my city the fee is based on prior quarter sales). If the business license is not renewed, the rights and privileges of the DBA cease to exist.

Although DBA's do expire we never renew them. They are really only required once to setup your bank account.  Once you get past that point there is little use in renewing a dba or a local business lic.
