My company is looking to produce a series of online educational videos. We purchased Camtasia to capture screenshots of the teaching, however now we want to hire a video editing company or person to really bring our work to life. We would provide the company with all the materials (videos, music, etc). 

Does anybody know of a professional, low cost company that would do this type of work? We are a start-up so on a tight budget. Thanks!

It took me forever to find these two companies, but in the spirit of good business i am going to share them with you.

www.transvideo.com 
They are not cheap, but if you want professional these are your guys.
They do the videos for box.net, facebook.com, and google. 
The amount of professionalism in their work is amazing!!!

www.visomedia.com
Michael Bayer <mkbayer@vismomedia.com>
Great guy, very creative, amazing portoflio.  
Not as big as transvideo, but still very professional.
I would take advantage of these guys before they get some big clients like microsoft, and no longer can afford to do budget friendly work.

Our company might be your answer.  We can produce videos for a fraction of video production companies.  You send us the footage which we upload into our Storyboard for you to pick the scenes, arrange the scenes, add titles, and more.  Then we do the editing magic and make it look professional.

If you're interested in another option, you could consider a film and video student. They'll usually do the work for peanuts so long as it can be included in their resume (well it's called a portfolio for them).

To find one, just talk to your local university that has an appropriate degree.
