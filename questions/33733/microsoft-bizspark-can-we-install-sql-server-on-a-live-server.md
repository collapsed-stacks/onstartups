## Microsoft BizSpark, can we install SQL Server on a live server?

Our website is currently run on a Hyper-V server and we use `SQL Server 2008 R2 Express`.  One annoying limitation of 2008-r2 is it has a `1gb RAM limit`.

We are enrolled on Bizspark from Microsoft which gives us access to a lot of free software.  We can download `SQL Server 2008 R2 Enterprise` from Bizspark but are unsure if we can install this on our virtual web server.

I've tried emailing Microsoft a couple of times but never receive an answer.  Can anyone point me in the right direction here?  Are we allowed to install this on our live server and use it as our database engine?

I think the program clearly states that you can use it as long as you meet the requirements

You should have been able to find this pretty easily with a google search of bizspark, production sql server
