## Are there real life apps that use a swear jar monetization model?

I was watching a television show where a character created an app called "Forbid," with an interesting monetization model. The idea was that you put the phone number of someone you shouldn't call (like an ex) into the app. The app blocks this number from your phone, unless you give in and pay $10 for the ability to call them.

So it's like making a business out of a swear jar. The business owner is the one who holds the swear jar and gets to keep the money in it, but customers willingly sign up to use the swear jar. I'm googling trying to find if anyone in the real world has applied this model successfully, but I can't find any.
