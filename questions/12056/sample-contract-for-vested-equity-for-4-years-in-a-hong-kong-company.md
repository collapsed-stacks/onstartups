I'm going to join a company as a late cofounder and after negotiation will receive a significant percentage of equity vested every months over 4 years and a small salary. The company is based in Hong Kong.
Do you have a sample contract that could apply to my case? Alternatively do you know a lawyer in Hong Kong that could do that quickly? It's rather urgentâ€¦.

Thanks,
Cheers

Try these Lawyers. They are recommended by the incubation program at the HK Science Park. Should have experience working with startups before.
