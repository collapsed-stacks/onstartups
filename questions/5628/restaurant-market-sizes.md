I understand the restaurant market decently. $500 billion covers every food service location in the country, with about $180 billion of that covering full-service restaurants. Those full-service eateries break down further into Casual, Upscale Casual, and Fine Dining.

What I want to know is the breakdown in overall markets (number of locations and size of market) for those three sub-groups. How much money is there in the Upscale Casual market vs. the Fine Dining market? Where can I find this information?

Many thanks for any help in this matter!

Happy new year,
 - Josh

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.restaurant.org/" rel="nofollow">national restaurant association</a> website.  In the research section, you can find a lot of information.</p>

<p>If you cannot find what you are looking for there, you can also check out <a href="http://www.foodindustryreview.com/" rel="nofollow">food industry review</a> where you can buy the chapter of restaurants (there is a free sample of the information in the chapter).</p>

<p>Another direction would be to check out the yellow pages and other listing websites (even Google maps), and see how many listings there are for each area and each type of restaurant.  The information is not organized into a report, but you can find a lot of information, and find your customers at the same time, since if they advertise via the yellow pages, they have a marketing budget.</p>
