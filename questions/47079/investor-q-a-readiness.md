We are an early stage web startup, and do not have anyone with deep financial experience on our team.  Is not a likely option at this point.

We are pitching to investors in a contest setting next week and want to be as prepared as possible for the Q&A, especially with regard to the financials.  The format is 5 minute pitch, 5 minute Q&A.  This is a precursor for us pitching to investors in a classic setting later.

What is a good list of questions we can expect from investors in order to prepare?  Acronyms like COC and other jargon would also be helpful.

<p>You didn't specify but I'll assume you don't mean financials with respect to taking on an outside investor (valuations, term sheets, etc). Instead I assume you mean the financials related to your operational business. </p>

<p>If I were an investor at a contest-type setting, with early-stage "companies", I would be mostly concerned with concept, execution, founding team and market size.  You might get a question like "how long and much money will it take to get to milestone X?" or "how much have you spent to date?".  I have sat in on a lot of angel-presentations and presented at a couple of early-stage concept forums, and never have received detailed financial questions.  Any financial projections you've made at this stage are assumed by investors to be BS :)</p>

<p>If nothing else, you should be able to answer the basic revenue question of "how will you make money?". i.e. who is going to pay you for X/Y/Z, how much will they pay you, how often will they pay you, and why will they pay you instead of someone else? Your answers there might trigger follow-on questions about market positioning (low-cost leader, premium brand, etc).   On the expense side, you should have a general idea of what fixed and variable costs you forsee and what things affect those costs. </p>

<p>If you can find it, check out videos from tech crunch disrupt or y combinator demo days. I think you'll find that the focus is on concept/execution/team/market and less on financials.  So if you have to choose, focus on that stuff first and financials later (hey, it worked for twitter).</p>

<p>The best is to go there and see...</p>

<p><strong>Don't expect getting investments at your first contest/pitch session, otherwise you risk to be disappointed.</strong></p>

<p>Prepare yourself to repeat and modify your pitch dozens of times. So listen to the investors questions, listen  to the feedback, listen to the pitches of other teams/startups. Get the maximum out of it and improve, improve, improve... </p>

<p><strong>These investors question during the contests are there not really for having correct answers</strong> (you will not make a investment decision after 5 minutes of Q/A) <strong>but to make you think about them - about the feasability, about the business side of your project, about the competition etc.</strong></p>

<p>So don't worry for the first time!</p>
