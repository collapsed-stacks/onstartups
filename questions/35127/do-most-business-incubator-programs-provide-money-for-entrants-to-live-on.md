If you have a good enough idea and business model and get accepted into a [business incubator][1] program but happen to have zero dollars in your bank account, do most of those types of programs provide a way for the assetless entrepreneurs to have their needs for food and shelter to be met while they are pouring all their time and effort into the business?

If the incubator provides funding, then you are supposed to use the money for your operational and living expenses.

If there's no funding provided with the program, then you have to figure out how to make money.

All programs are different so check their conditions before applying.
