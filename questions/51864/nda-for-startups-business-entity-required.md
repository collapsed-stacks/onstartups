<p>When dealing with NDAs, does the "startup" need to register a business entity in order for the agreement to take place? Say if I only registered for a domain, say <code>onstartup.com</code>, can the NDA agreement specify <code>onstartup.com</code> as the disclosing party or <code>startup</code> or <code>www.startup.com</code> or just my name that was used to register the domain?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>A domain is not a recognized legal entity, as such the owner of the domain will be considered the legal entity.</p>

<p>The NDA will be signed against your name, although it is recommended that you instead register a company and do the NDA through that.</p>

<p>Most countries allow for a simple registration process (although the levels of bureaucracy vary) for new businesses. </p>
