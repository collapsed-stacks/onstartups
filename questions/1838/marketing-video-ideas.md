Part of my marketing mix for my SaaS will be creating/using a promotional video. I'll place it on my marketing website, YouTube, and SEO/SEM campaigns. I understand that the most effective videos focus on creating a connection or trust with the creator in 2-4 minutes rather than actually pitching a product or showing how to use it. Luckily I have someone lined up to do the production work, I just need to create the copy/storyboard. 

Does anyone have a favorite video or ones they find really doing a fine job? Is using humor a good idea? (the SaaS is a B2B product) Thanks.

The most important thing to think about when making your video (or for that matter, any content) is your *audience*.

Make a concerted effort to product something that if you were in their shoes, you'd want to watch.  This is usually *not* overtly self-promotional stuff that just talks about your company and your product.  

Share useful interesting content that people *want* to watch and share with their friends.  

Quick tactical tips:

1) Humor works well, but is very hard.  

2) Test, test, test.  Show the idea to some people that will give you honest feedback.  Do this *before* the video is produced and you're emotionally attached.  You're not going to want to make changes if you're too far in.

3) Don't get overly concerned about the production values.  You don't have to spend a fortune to create a successful video.  People are forgiving about the production quality -- but unforgiving about selling/marketing too hard.

4) Keep the video short (usually < 2 minutes) -- especially in the early days.  Until you've built an audience/following, people are not going to invest much time watching something unless it's *really* useful or interesting to them.
