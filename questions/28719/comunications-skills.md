I have technical background and founder of software startup. Now, I started learning the importance of Communications Skills in demos and meeting with prospective clients.

Any books or courses recommendations to conquer this field as well?

Thanks

I second Toastmasters. Speak often.

And even moreso I'd post videos of yourself on Facebook and ask for hard and constructive criticism. Pick a semi-simple topic...how google works... and do a 5 minutes on that. Use a few props.

Self-improvement books are not communication books. Neither are persuasion books...they are great for tips about content but you really want to learn about being both relaxed and present - to be able to speak on or off-the-cuff to group or in-person.

I like Resonate by Duarte in that it speaks to preparation, but doing it with feedback is the direct route.  I can speak to that (NO PUN!!!) from experience.

I recommend you **Even a geek can speak** which is a sort of highly detailed summary of everyhing I read on the subject, so reading this book is all you need, ... in addition of practice of course :)

Rather than books and digital learning. As you are a founder of a company you will be surely financially fit. So, why not you appoint a personal lady secretary who is good at speaking English. And you can learn very easily and in best time. :-)
