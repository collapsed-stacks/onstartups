Where can I find more information on setting up a small business in USA as a Canadian citizen? I need to incorporate in the USA, would this automatically allow me to work in USA? Or does there need to be certain amount of money invested in this LLC?

<p>You can start with the <a href="http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/business-law-advisor/starting-business-us-foreign-national" rel="nofollow">SBA</a>.  They usually have a good resources.  As far as businesses go, to start an LLC you have to have a registered address and a registered agent in the state where you start the LLC.  Each state has different rules/regulations, so consider that when you begin.</p>

<p>Just because you start a business, does not give you the right to a) enter b) live or c) work in the US.  You'll need to personally go through the visa process for this.</p>

<p>@JonnyBoats is right, 3 separate questions, each with a more detailed list of what you want to do will help the community provide the best answer.</p>
