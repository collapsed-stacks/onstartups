Ok so this is somewhat urgent since the Delaware franchise tax is due in a day, but right as I was about to pay I had a question: Do I need to pay any franchise taxes this year even though I incorporated just a month ago in 2013 and my accounting year is just the calendar year. The taxes that are due tomorrow, they're for the past calendar year (if I understand correctly), so I'm not sure I need to pay anything since our corporation didn't even exist back then. We also haven't made any money in this time.

Any help would be much appreciated.

So after talking to our registered agents, some people familiar with taxes, reading the Delaware tax site, researching the web, and getting conflicting advice from all of them, I finally just found the number for the Delaware franchise tax board, called them, waited forever, and got an answer. We do NOT need to pay taxes as our company was filed in 2013 and the taxes due tomorrow are for the 2012 tax year. 

Lesson learned: Next time, just go straight to the source and ask them, regardless of how long they're gonna put you on hold.
