Here is how our startup is dividing equity among Founders and Investors: 2 Founders (43% and 25%), Investors (200K investment, 1M valuation, 1% for every 10K up to 20%), Advisors (5 at 1.5%), and Developer 4%.  Is this reasonable?

Is your developer working with you full-time?  If so, I'd look at getting the dev a bit more equity, especially if you see them doing more than just prototype work.  If this is a tech startup (i.e. web-based system, mobile system, etc) then I would at least double the amount of equity for the dev.  If the developer is NOT full time (i.e. has a "day job") then I would recommend exchanging some of the equity for cash.  The last thing you want is dead equity.

Best of luck!
