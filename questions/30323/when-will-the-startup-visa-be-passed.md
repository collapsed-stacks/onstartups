I know that the Startup Visa is under discussion in congress. But does anyone know when this visa will be passed, or what the process of passing the bill is? I'm looking for this visa.

The bill has to be agreed upon by Congress and passed by both chambers. It looks like it won't get passed- leadership of the congressional committee responsible for initial approval of the bill is opposed to it.

<p>It may never become law, as the US government is busy with other stuff right now, and seems to have overlooked the fact that welcoming overseas entrepreneurs is a great idea.</p>

<p>I'd love to launch my next startup in the USA but it is impossible to get a visa from the UK.</p>
