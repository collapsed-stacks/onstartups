First, why do you need an MBA to manage you? 

If you have a desire to start a startup then you should be self-managing, but, if you are having organization issues, such as time-management problems, or making certain the critical, but non-core tasks are done, then that is a different problem, and you may more easily find an assistant for that.

It is interesting that you would give them the controlling share of your business, without knowing the person.

Where are you located?

What type of product/service have you developed?

Why do you need an MBA?

What skills are you missing, where you need a new person in such a critical manner?  (OK, this was poorly worded, I can't think of a better way of asking)

What you really need is someone who complements your skills. If you have the technical skills, then you need someone with business skills to help. The important thing to keep in mind is what you said about your vision. Whomever this person is, they need to share your vision first and having a business education is great but not necessary.

A formal business education does have it's advantages but don't let that single piece of data skew your judgement. There are plenty of successful entrepreneurs that don't have MBA's as well as plenty that do.

Your best bet on finding a co-founder with business skills is to look among your friends and colleagues. As James put it, you need to figure out your strengths and weaknesses and find a co-founder that fills in where you are weak.

Before you do that, you should figure out what you want to do. The more thought out and solid the idea, the easier it will be to explain and attract a quality co-founder.

As for control of your venture, you should retain more control at this point. Whomever you choose, you clearly have to be able to trust them with your business affairs. Don't be so anxious to put complete control of your destiny into someone else.

The place to find an MBA is around business schools...  They have alumni networks, and you can find them that way.

Now that I answered your question, I feel the need to say that an MBA is overrated...  If you don't have the management skills or experience, then you should defiantly seek a co-founder that will compliment your skill set in that regard.

Would that person hold an MBA?  Not necessarily...  You should look for someone with management experience in your field, with entrepreneurial experience.  You could also seek a mentor, and manage the business on your own, but a co-founder with experience is better.

As for the 51% you a offering, it seems unwise...  You should share the equity equally, and have a good founders agreement that will take care of tie-breakers when you don't agree, as well as all the other relevant issues that founders agreements deal with.

Before you go ahead and give your company away to an MBA or anyone else, make sure that its the right person.  Giving away 51% makes no sense.


In what field is your business?

It doesn't sound like self-employment is the right thing for you at the moment. But if you insist, I would recommend a personal assistant on a part-time basis vs an MBA.

If it's true that your willing to give up control of your business (51%+) at such an early stage, your really not entrepreneurial material. You would be much better off investing in a company at a lower rate of risk and participate (if possible) as a passive advisor.

Good Luck and keep me posted on your journey.

Color me jaded, but **why** would you want to hire someone to "boss" you? You're giving away 51% (if one can even do that in an LLC) so you lose whatever collaborative voice you have in any company decision making.

While I can understand if you feel you don't have a particular skillset to bring the company to the next level, you should still feel that you have something to offer, are self directed, and operate as a key contributor to the effort.  

And why is it that an MBA automatically is granted the right to *manage* ? I know MBA's who couldn't lead their way through a tunnel, forget about leading a startup.  

Look inside to find your value add to the effort, then look for a person who compliments your strengths.
