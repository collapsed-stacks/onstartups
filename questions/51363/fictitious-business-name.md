<p>I own a California sole proprietorship. 5 years ago I filed a ficticious business name registration and also published a notice.  I have just been asked by the County of San Mateo to renew my filing, and I have done that.  Is it necessary or recommended that I re-publish, too?  Thank you, Natasha</p>

<p>You do not need to re-publish the ad: "There is no advertising requirement if there have been no changes to the facts in the original statement."</p>
