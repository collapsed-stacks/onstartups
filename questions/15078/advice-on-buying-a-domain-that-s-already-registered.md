I am interested in purchasing a good domain name that is currently being offered at $7K.  Can anyone provide me any guidance on how to negotiate these deals and things to consider, lookout for, in this process?

Definitely use an escrow service. I've used Escrow.com (backed by Fidelity) in the past and had a good experience.

Here's some advice if you get into negotiating

<p>I'll add the following advice from the eBook <a href="http://howtobuyawebsite.org" rel="nofollow">Buying Profitable Websites on Flippa</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buying a keyword domain is tricky—you need to know three key pieces of information
  to get one:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>How many people search for this <em>exact</em> term in a month?</li>
  <li>Where do they search? Is it in your country or others?</li>
  <li>How competitive is the term? Are there a lot of other sites trying to do this
  same thing?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If a search term has more than 12,000 searches for the exact term on local US searches,
  and there isn’t much competition, it might be worth pursuing. But if the search volume
  is particularly low, say 350, or the competition is very high, or most searches happen
  somewhere you are unlikely to get sales for your product—this keyword isn’t very
  valuable to you.</p>
  
  <p>For these reasons, we recommend that you avoid buying domain-only auctions. There
  are a few exceptions to this rule:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If you own another product and you wish to claim your brand domain, you
  can file a lawsuit against the infringing party to get your brand name back, per
  ICANN rules. However, for this to apply, you must have a registered brand in
  the form of a trademark in order to proceed.</li>
  <li>If you wish to obtain a particular keyword domain, you can bid on it and if
  the interest is low in the overall auction, negotiate afterward if the seller’s
  expectations are too high. Being the only interested party in an auction does
  give you some leverage, since the seller will have few options.</li>
  <li>If the domain is something you want to use to start a business AND is
  reasonably priced for your budget, AND it is one of the top 3 TLDs (com/org/
  net), then this auction might be worth buying.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
