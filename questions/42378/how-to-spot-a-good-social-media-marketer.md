It's a bit subjective but helpful and on-topic IMO, mayebe should be made community wiki

I've been in contact with some guest bloggers lately which are interested in publishing posts on my website's blog, so far I've done a regular weekly blog and had a guy marketing it, but he's too busy to do more work right now.

Now I need someone to market these blog posts on social media, the last guy I just got by recommendation from a friend, but now I need to find one myself.

What criteria should I check when it comes to social media marketers?

Do the number of followers and fans on their accounts and/or the number of votes they get for articles they market mean anything, or is impossible to know if it's spam?

That's about the only criterion I could think of so far...

Thanx to anyone who helps

You look for social proof that they've done good work (client quotes / case studies on their web sites for example).

You then ask for references from previous clients on the good work that they have done.

I would ask them the following questions:

 1. What blog posts would you recommend I write to engage with my community?
 2. Who do you think are my social community?
 3. What's the biggest social media campaign you've run, what was great about it, and how could it apply to my blog?

Questions for you:

 - How are you deciding what blogs to write if you're not out there active in your community yourself?
 - How do you keep up with current trends in your community if you are not active yourself?
 - Do you really want to delegate this to someone else?
