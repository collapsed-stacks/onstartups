My biggest hobby/interest is to ask questions on the Internet. I have to admit this hobby brings me a lot. I feel I am an innate asker.I'm asking questions on the Internet always every day. I have asked probably over 5000 questions over the past 5 years.Now I think it is my personal habit. My question is, how can I combine asking questions on the Internet with money making? Can you figure out a business or money making formula that can take advantage of my habit?

It would be easy to take your question the wrong way - *especially given the number of questions you have asked recently on this site* ...

... but there are a number of books based on the idea of writing spoof/genuine letters to people and collecting the replies. (I'm not a fan of these myself, as they sometimes take too much advantage of people who are trying to be helpful).

Ask genuine questions in multiple places, collect good/interesting/funny replies, check you have the rights to use those replies (so check the copyright conditions carefully), then publish a book.

Collect advice centered on universal themes - and be kind to people who try to help. Let people's replies speak from themselves and don't intersperse them with sarcastic comments. (Sometimes it's difficult to tell a troll from a newbie, and all you'll do is stop newbies getting their questions answered.)

Bonus points if you succeed in getting advice from unlikely sources without being banned from the website. (e.g. Marriage advice from slashdot; advice on washing clothes from the NRA; ...)

Good Luck, and please, **Do No Harm**.

**Sites like this can only work while people believe the questioner will actually be helped by the answer.**

I think mostly people reward answers more than questions, but you could always start a quiz show :-)

how bout this - you ask questions of yourself, then blog about getting the answer. no need for a forum like this then ... just you asking and answering, but also the drama in between as you show the world how your mind works and moves from Q to A. Great drama. Your site is sure to be a hit. Then, when the blog goes viral to millions of regular visitors, you (a) sell ads, and (b) offer a free-mium model with the really great answer-quests behind the pay wall.

I actually think this is a pretty interesting question. The first thing that came into my head was www.formspring.me. It's a new social media site starting to get attention by the likes of Gary Vaynerchuck and others. 

Essentially you set up a profile and you can ask, or be asked anything (and other peeps provide answers). Its still early days, but if celebrities start to embrace the site, I can just imagine droves of users signing up and using it. 

I know this doesn't directly answer your question. But I wanted to show you an example of someone creating something in-line with your passion (who is also likely to monetize when the time is right). Now, I'm not saying to go out and copy their idea, but the opportunities are still there, so don't worry about the cynics.

And no i'm not associated / affiliated with the site. I heard about it a few weeks ago and messed around with it a few times. Not a regular user yet but I will definitely keep it in mind.

Best of luck!
