I know that it is very difficult to gauge a candidate's attitude / work ethics from the start. What are the most important things you look for a candidate that will be fit for a startup software company?

 * **Willingness to do things they've never done** (new technologies, random job responsibilities). Someone who regularly programs in their spare time with new technologies is good.
 * **Ability to pick up new skills quickly** (similar to above)
 * **Gets things done** ('big ideas' people are good, but you really need people who will execute at a startup). Look for someone who has a long list of projects at previous jobs.
 * **Prioritization** - there's always too much work at a startup, knowing what's most important and gives the best bang for the buck is critical. Look for candidates that have done this in the past.
 * **Ability to tolerate uncertainty and vagueness.** Many times you simply don't know what's best and you have to make a guess and go with it. You could give candidates coding/problem questions and see how they react. Do they ask more questions, freeze, start coding or give you a memorized answer? I'd go for someone who asks a few questions then makes a rough guess (and understands they are making a guess)
 * **Tolerates (even celebrates) failure.** Everyone makes mistakes, the important thing is to recognize and act on them. Ask them about their biggest (or most memorable) mistake, see how they talk about it.
 * **Able to work with little management/direction.** Someone who needs constant management and being told what to do will be dead weight at a startup. Look for someone who took the initiative for tasks and responsibilities at previous jobs.
 * **Able to take and give criticism well.** Nothing kills small groups faster is someone who's a jerk or defensive. Try critiquing a candidate's answer and see how they respond.
 * **Excellent communication skills.** Poor communication will kill a startup or project. Ask them to explain a very technical project they did. Read their blog and resume carefully. Take note of how they speak in the interview process.
 * **Some experience in the business field and customer understanding** Since they will be building version 1.0, it's important they understand the problem and the customer. Having that insight will be super beneficial for them to help figure out solutions.
 * **Broad technical proficiency and experience** I'm not too concerned about particular languages, just that they have a core understanding of basic CS topics and technologies. With only a few developers at a startup, they'll have to work on everything.

Hiring:

Phase 1: do they have integrity, intelligence, maturity (can they handle stress and setbacks)?

Phase 2: are they positive, energize others, courage to make tough decisions, and get things done?

Phase 3: why did they leave their last job? and the job before that?  Make reference calls, and probe.
