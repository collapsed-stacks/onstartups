I'm afraid this is common in web development agencies for small clients, delivering end to end site/app. Once you delivered the main site to client, his budget and time will favour operation, marketing etc. There will still be budget for maintenance and continuous improving, but not that much as main project. And that budget is only available if the site is successful.

Seeing such a situation, I think you'd better define "long time client" as "satisfied and successful client". "Satisfied" means he will still work with you when having budget, "success" ensures that budget.

Once you have enough such clients, you don't need to worry about new business too much. Every client will have small but easy work for you. The sum will be big.

Before you reaching that point, you'll still need to work hard on gaining new leads and contracts.

Another important consideration is to do your best to help clients' success, rather than simply follow, make and collect.

My two cents.
