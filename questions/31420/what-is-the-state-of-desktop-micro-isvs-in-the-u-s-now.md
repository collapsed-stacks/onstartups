I'm interested in understanding the state of what I'll call "desktop micro ISVs" in the U.S. in 2011.  By this I mean one-person computer software companies, creating desktop computer software, and selling it via download.  This would be servicing the general interested public, not a niche industry.

The sorts of questions I have are things like (rough estimates are fine):

 - How many such companies exist in the U.S. currently?  
 - What is the range of profitability for these in the U.S. now?
 - How likely is such a company to face legal problems, such as patent infringement issues (given the U.S.'s problematic patent law regarding software)?
 - Given finished software, what sort of weekly time commitment should one expect in terms of running the business?
 - What sources can you recommend to help understand more?

<p>A couple of points:</p>

<p>I would say like the rest of desktop software, microISV desktop software is waning. Not dead. Not gone. Just not the place to find huge home runs.</p>

<p>MicroISV profitability ranges from 0 to $1m gross revenue, with most successful microISVs doing 2-3 times what they could as employee/freelance programmers.</p>

<p>I know of not one instance of a microISV confronted with a patent issue.</p>

<p>As for weekly time commitment - the more time you spend intelligently, the more your revenue.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Business of Software Forum at (<a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?biz" rel="nofollow">http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?biz</a>)</p>
