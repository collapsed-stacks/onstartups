How can I improve the rate at which as a startup a group of 3 people get things done?

We are a group of 3, and have a few web apps that run in a mostly automated fashion. But improving on these products in order to build in features and generate exposure to hit the tipping points of success is taking us a very long time.

We have a clear vision and direction, and are readily implementing lean startup principles, but we dont have the funds or cashflow to take on more staff.

In attempting to solve this problem I have read and tried to implement what I have learnt from the following books:

 - The Goal, Elihayu Goldratt
 - One Minute Manager, Kenneth Blanchard
 - One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey, Ken Blanchard
 - Lean Startup, Eric Reis

It seems the problem we're facing is quite similar to [a post](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.589768.12) at Joel on Software/Business of Software.

If your apps are running in an automated fashion, I'm having a hard time believing 3 people working full-time can't get one of the apps where it needs to be. Do you lack technical expertise? Is this a full-time venture for all of you?

At your current rate, how long is it going to take? Three people can build a lot of features and functionality in an application if they know what needs to be done and how to do it.

What have you left out?

<p>Without knowing your exact problems and your overall situation I may just guess what's about to be done better. Nevertheless I hope my guesses will help you at least a bit. </p>

<p>I saw the books you have read. They are great for starters. You definitely now have the right mindset and the right knowledge about different stuff. I even added some of those to read myself. </p>

<p>I suppose there is one thing missing in your paradigm. Maybe it is the focus and not just getting more things done (because that's not as important as) but getting the right things done at the right time. The most reasonable source for that methodology is (of my opinion) <a href="http://37signals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://37signals.com/</a> and their books.</p>

<p>I've read both: </p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0578012812" rel="nofollow">Getting Real</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0307463745" rel="nofollow">Re-work</a>;</li>
</ol>

<p>There is nothing there that will change your stat up for instant, but both of those books help a lot for getting the right mindset towards the upper statement: getting the Right things done at the Right time. That will not improve your rate of accomplishing but will definitely improve the outcome of your time spend over your business. </p>

<p>I hope I've been of help. </p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you if any additional questions occur. :)</p>
