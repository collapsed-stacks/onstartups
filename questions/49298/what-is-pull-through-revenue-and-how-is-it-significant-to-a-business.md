I have heard the term **pull-through revenue** but do not know what it means, and I have not been able to find a good definition online. I have the sense that it may be related to maintenance of products; is that true? Is/How is it important for the long-term survival of a business?

Pull Through revenue can be defined as additional revenues gained by selling / managing the entire solution set upon which your product in included.  Example would be selling Cisco Unified Communications Manager and then selling routers, switches, handsets (the pull-through products) to complete the solution.

How important it is depends on your business model.
