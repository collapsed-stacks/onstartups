We have just lauched a website for our upcoming SPARQL Database Server. We would like to attract the interest of international seed investors, but we are not sure where to start looking. We are based in Norway, but are interested in seed investors worldwide. Anyone know how we should go about looking for them?

Look for them close to home. The majority of seed and angel investors invest in businesses that are geographically close to them. 

Talking to people you know who are investors is a good way to get referred to seed funders. If you don't know anyone, Google and then use LinkedIn (or a similar networking site) to find out connections you have in common. It is often better to approach funders by being referred by someone they know (and trust preferably!) 

Also, people you know in your industry are a good place to start. They will often invest in a project that they see can help their business.

Register at angel.co (AngelList). Make sure to populate your profile as much as you can, before publishing it (this is very important). Either way, you'll find more investors there then anywhere else.

There are incubator hubs and european crowdfunding platforms that exist today.  Believe www.symbid.com is one of them.
