<p>Try attending local meetups. I searched on meetup.com for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=entrepreneurs&amp;mcId=c33101&amp;mcName=&amp;lat=&amp;lon=&amp;userFreeform=Miami,%20Florida,%20USA&amp;gcResults=&amp;submitButton=Search&amp;op=search">entrepreneurs in the Miami area</a>, and I got 79 results. Searching for <a href="http://startups.meetup.com/cities/us/fl/miami/">startups in Miami</a> gives 11 results.</p>

That can also depend on what type of partner you're looking for. These days most entrepreneurs need a technical/hacker co-founder. These guys are in demand and can be a bit allusive to find. You can participate in startup weekends, local user groups or do some contract work to get to know them.

If you are saying that you have a great idea and you need a partner to fund it then that's a whole other ball game.

Events such as start-up weekends are great way to connect with suitable people. However, from my experience best guys are already busy. My approach would be networking as much as possible and getting to know potential partners better... you should not rush just to get project started, because if you do, it will be more of a lottery where odds of getting suitable partner are against you.

I've never used this, but founderdating.com is becoming a really important tool.
