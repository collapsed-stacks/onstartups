I am having problems getting my head around facebook pages. I'm a technical guy, and I have read the facebook docs as well as a few blogs on why to use facebook pages - however, I don't quite get it. The bit I don't get is the fact  that facebook (as I understand it) seems bent on "imposing" the criteria that you attach a personal account to the corporate page.

I don't quite see the point of this - as it particularly defeats the object of a 'corporate' page - i.e. a separate entity. I have a number of websites which cover diverse (and non overlapping areas). I consider each website a separate and distinct internet property or SBU (strategic business unit) in its own right - and I want to create and manage the brands separately - and most importantly, I dont want to link the companies to my personal FB page, which I use for my less formal interaction with close friends and family.

So, what am I missing here?. Is my understanding of how to create a corporate page on facebook wrong?

All I want to do is to create a corporate page (one for each entity/website) so that:

1. clients/website members etc can post to the wall
2. I (or someone else designated as admin) can post updates to the site
3. Clients/site members can 'like' (or is it be 'friends' of?) the page
4. My private messages/communication/profile etc is kept completely separate from the corporate page(s).

Can someone please enlighten me on how to achieve the above - or tell me if it is not possible. I can't help but think, if I as a techie (developer), am finding it so difficult to set things up - they (FB), can't have done a good job....

Facebook requires that it knows who is personally responsible and this seems fine. You do not need to show your personal info on your corporate pages and you can have as many as you want of those. Basically Facebook only requires that IT knows, they do not care if it is shown publicly or not.

Considering this, there should be no problem working with this requirement.

I've encountered the same problem. I believe the easiest solution would be to register a new profile under your website's name and then register the Facebook page under that profile. This way there's no connection to your personal profile, though you would have to re-login to administrate the Facebook page.
