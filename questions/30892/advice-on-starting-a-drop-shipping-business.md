I want to start a drop shipping online shop. The products can be anything that could be profitable.  

I'm thinking about stuff like:  

- Latex clothing
- Toys for children
- Japanese electronics like rice cookers

My questions:

- Any general advice on drop shipping?
- Is there a list of **reliable** drop shippers?
- What if, for example, the product doesn't arrive or the customer claims to have not received it?  

Thank you for your time.

<p>This is the most popular website I know for finding good drop shipping partners.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.worldwidebrands.com/" rel="nofollow">World Wide Brands</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended in <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0307465357" rel="nofollow">4 Hour Work Week by Timothy Ferris</a> - which would be a good book for you to read. It has a couple sections about setting up an online business that uses drop shippers.</p>
