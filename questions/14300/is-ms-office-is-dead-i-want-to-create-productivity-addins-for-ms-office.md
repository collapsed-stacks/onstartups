We are using Google doc now, but I found lots of flocks are still using MS office (word, power point, excel). I have a created a small addins for MS Office few months back for self use and found couple of people like it. I want to polish it and put on web for sale.

Would it worth to create office add-ins in the era of web? Is there any real example so that i can keep inspire my self?

Is there any way i can develop office addins kind of app for apps for google doc.

MS Office has the largest share in the office productivity software space. No matter how much Google or anybody else for that matter blogs about it, they are not even in the same order of magnitude to be considered a competition to it.

Plus, there are already so many office users using Word, Excel, Powerpoint everyday. That is your market. 

I say go for it. It will be worth the trouble.

I say go for it. Contact Microsoft and let them know about the product once its made. They might even help you get it out the door.

I would say there is still a market for it, most of your large corporations from my experience are still using MS Office and Exchange. Though I'm not sure how much success addins have in general. I don't know of any one personally using them, though I deal mostly with engineers that tend to just write anything custom they need in the programming back end. The same goes for most of the managers, they have excel tied into custom databases, doing sql queries and everything else.

Office develoepr tools are available with Microsoft Visual Studio. Also the built-in macro editor helps us to extend Office. The office products may be not so important in the age of web and cloud based free solutions like Google Docs. But on the other hand, corporate offices still relies on the office programs. 

Windows operating systems and Microsoft office are the two best divisions of Microsoft. Office also has online version where you can create documents for free  and store in Sky Drive. In my experience, none of the mail clients can compete well with Microsoft Office Outlook it's one of the best email client solution. However, the online mail services like Gmail and hot mail giving better flexibility like conversational view, almost unlimited storage faster interface etc. Ultimately office works with any webservices which supports standard message protocols. But it's not really in the age of death. Google docs is a true competitor for Microsoft.
