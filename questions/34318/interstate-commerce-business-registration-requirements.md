What states in the United States, if any, require business registration to solicitate business and collect revenue?

In this scenario, the business has no opperations in the state the business is solicating business, solicitation is done via email/mail/phone/etc, service/product delivery is done via "common courier" (meaning mail/Internet/etc); all of which to my understanding means no sales tax is required in the "foreign"/customer state, or the "domestic"/business state.

What's not clear is if any registration is required in any "foreign" states (for example: DBAs, permits, license, etc.) --or if the only require is you're in good standing if the "domestic" state.

Given the laws related to sales tax are likely more important, and allow for low requirements to do interstate commerce -- my guess is there are no requirements, but I'm unable to find any opinions, laws, case law, etc that appears to relate to the topic of filing requirements for interstate commerce in foreign states where the business has no operations; as defined by laws related to sales tax.

Business off the top of my head that this might relate to are; Internet retail, mail catalogs, SaaS, etc.

<p>Whether you are "doing business" in a state can be asked for three different purposes. You have mentioned two of them: For the purpose of requiring registration to conduct business, and for the purpose of taxation. The third is for the purpose of subjecting the company to the jurisdiction of the state's courts.</p>

<p>I will not address taxation, because it is outside my areas of expertise.</p>

<p>As concerns requiring registration to conduct business, that is not established solely by interstate commerce - activities within the state are required. For example, in California the test is "entering into repeated and successive transactions of its business in this state, other than interstate or foreign commerce".</p>

<p>These issues are discussed in <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/04/04/when-doing-business-isnt-doing-business/" rel="nofollow">When “Doing Business” isn’t “Doing Business”</a>. You might find the New York Department of State Legal Memorandum referenced toward the end of that post particularly informative.</p>
