I need an advise on starting my work on my ideas. I am doing job for 5 years and a senior Java engineer. I have great some thing inside, to bring my ideas in execution and to see myself as a founder of them. My regular job is paying me good. What I am thinking is to start working (solo) on my ideas with my job. How can these two things go parallel? My regular job will help me to fund my startup. Just like, getting design services and hosting etc. So when I will see I can earn money from my apps. I will leave my job and to start full time on my own stuff. 

What you guys advise me on it.

 - Definitely keep your current job for now.
 - Work on your idea on the side, try to spend as much time as you can on it.
 - Try and get a partner. Do you know any other good Java programmers or other people who would like to work on an idea with you? That will make doing things in your spare time easier. You guys will also be able to motivate each other.
 - Once you have some happy customers than you can consider transitioning full time to it.

I would suggest getting a small team together to work with. 
It's really tough to do everything yourself. But, doable.

It sounds like you don't have a set idea or plan yet, so I would definitely start working on something while you still have a job. Working on it for a few months will tell you if you are really passionate about it or not, which is best to find out while you still have a job.

Just make sure you don't have any non-compete or invention clauses in your current job that would impact anything you do on the side.

Also probably relevant, I personally wasn't able to progress any ideas until I quit my job and focused on it full time. I needed the pressure of it needing to be successful for me to actually focus and launch something. That will likely depend on your personality.

Doing both is tough but it sounds like you really need your day job until you figure out your vision.

I would suggest that you find a specific idea to work on and work on it until you have a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Then you can quit your job once you get some traction in the marketplace.

Keep the current job and try to invest some proper time, maybe on weekends, to develop. Focus on those things(features) that you can achieve easily now.
 
Make a blog to keep updating your audience with what are you doing. You might get some people on board working for you as well. You can hire freelancers/interns too.

I think that you will reach a point, where you will realize that this might be the right time to quit your current job and take your own work full-time.
