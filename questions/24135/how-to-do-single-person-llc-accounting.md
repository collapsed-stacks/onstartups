I am in a single person LLC, so I am allowed to file my taxes on my personal return and I don't have to cut myself paychecks.  I would prefer to take all of the money out at the end of the year.  However, I still need to pay estimated taxes each quarter, so what is a good way to compute payroll taxes that I need to remit without actually cutting myself a check as well?  Maybe even a recommended payroll "tutorial" would be helpful as I am kind of foggy on this area.

<p>IANAA but my understanding is that LLCs do not have a payroll tax.  You are, of course, responsible for income tax which would be calculated as if you had a job that paid you your profit.  Add to that <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98846,00.html" rel="nofollow">self-employment tax</a> and your tax situation should be covered.</p>

<p>An easy rule of thumb is to sock away your tax percentage (tax bracket + self employment tax) for each sale/contract/etc. and pay that amount each quarter.</p>

<p>If it helps to clarify in the case where a single person LLC that is not filing as a corporation the LLC is ignore for tax purposes and you are merely claiming a regular individual tax return.</p>
