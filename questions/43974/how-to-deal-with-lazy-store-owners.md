I am starting an eCommerce marketplace of local stores, they can upload their products on my platform and buyers can place orders through us. I also plan to have a program like powership (ebay ) for the sellers. 

However for delivery is where the problem kicks in. This is based in India and the problem is the normal retail stores are not really professional, so I am anticipating this situation - if the vendor receives an order and marks it ready for shipping and I forward the order to the shipping company for pick up - and the  vendor doesn't keep the order ready for pick up.  This will result in lot of cost as the shipping company will still charge .

Any ideas on how I can solve this problem?  - may be some rules i should create ? or something ? 
 Please help me - this is a problem I want to solve and run not away from.

Have an agreement with them that if they place product on your site, someone orders it and they don't have it in stock or ready to ship within 24 hours for pick-up that they will be charged for the shipping and also be on probation and potentially lose privileges of using the site.

Your site should be an asset to them and help them make sales and create revenue. If they don't do their part then charge them or suspend them from using your service.
