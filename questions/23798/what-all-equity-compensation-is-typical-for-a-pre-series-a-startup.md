I am being offered a full-time position at a start-up that has been around for 2+ years but is pre series-A. It has some angel funding.

Most likely there won't be any cash compensation (or very little). There is one founder, and a couple of employees.

What % equity should I expect?

This is a bit hard to answer unless we know what your contribution is to the startup.

 - Are you essential to the success of the startup?
 - Are you making major contributions?
 - Could they hire anyone to do what you are doing?
 - How is equity **already** split up at the startup?
 - Are the others receiving only equity, only pay, or equity and pay?
