We are getting into the dev of a mobile app for our startup. I have a preference in terms of which platform I want to start with, due to my current market demographics. However I also fall under the same demographic and have a mobile with the same OS. 

If you had to choose *one* of the following on which to release your first app, which one would it be and why?

**Android**

**iPhone**

**Blackberry**

EDIT: The app is for a niche restaurant review site, where the demographics are mainly comprised of young professionals with a passion for food and drink.

iPhone has a good edge for a first platform for several reasons:

1. Market share (Google demographics of mobile market and I think you'll see your target user is heavily iPhone centric). 

2. Do a little informal market research. Walk into several local restaurants and spend 15 minutes counting the number of iPhones vs other platforms. I believe iPhone will dominate your count.

3. The Apple app store is a very powerful, easy, low cost way to launch a mobile app.

4. Perception - The general public is tremendously warm to all things Apple. Associating your startup early with this culture allows Apple's huge marketing efforts to flow positively towards your company.

There've been valid points made for both Android and iPhone. I've led development and defined the business case for iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and java versions of our product, and based on that I have some perspectives:

 - my iPhone apps let me sleep well. The dictatorial rule of the app store make it easier for me to know my apps work, by and large.  The iPhone has been a really stable platform.
 - The marketing cachet of the iPhone is undeniable, not to mention the reach and power of the brand.  Don't underestimate that.
 - Android has lower hurdles, true. But the platform's fragmenting, with new skins for Android from different manufacturers, and a lot of rev. levels out in the wild.  Google pushed a software upgrade to some of my users and it revealed a bug - stopped my customers dead in their tracks.  That's something to consider.  When we developed for BlackBerry, a platform for which I can't wait to age out of our 'inventory', the variations of O/S appearance and layout between carriers was a real nightmare.
 - Android vs. iPhone is that classic battle of cheaper ubiquity over quality: PC vs. Mac; Kalashnikov vs. M-16, Cosmonauts' lead pencils vs. NASA's pressurized Space Pen, etc.  There's an opening here to speculate their future, but why bother.  Accept that you need both today.  
 - Android is growing like wildfire but which demographic is most important to you now,  when you're building appeal and initial loyalty?

Based on experience and the great points by Keith and others, I'm guessing iPhone

In my experience (as an Android developer) I'd go with Android.

reasons:
1. While android may not be surpassing iphone in market share yet, it is experiencing the fastest growth.  so looking to the future, I'd stick with Android.

2. Being a college student and a "young professional" the majority of my friends and co-workers have android phones.

3. It's really easy to start developing on android.  You pay a $25 fee which allows you to sell on the marketplace, and you're done.

Your target demographic is Restaurant goers? definitely iPhone first. It's more fashionable and more likely to be found in the hands of those who prefer fine dining (I am saying that without an iota of cynicism).

A more important consideration would be your country. In India for example only around 5% of the smart phone users have an iPhone or Android. This is totally different than that of the US. You are from Canada thus you should try to get the local smart phone market shares and pick the largest platform.

The latest statistics shows that iOS is the most used platform in Canada in 2012 http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_os-ww-monthly-201211-201211-map  Android and BlackBerry are also popular, so before choosing the operating system, you may conduct a research and discover your clients' preferences. If you plan to develop a business app, BlackBerry should be considered. Also, Windows Phone is increasing its popularity and can get a significant market share in the nearest future. 
Anyway, you will win from designing an app for iOS or Android, so do not hesitate.
