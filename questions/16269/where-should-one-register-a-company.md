I'm not a US citizen but planning to start an international business. So I'm wondering if there's a benefit/profit/perspective of registering a company in a different country than mine, like US, for example. What's the difference and what can I get from it?

**EDIT:** What if someone registers the same company in a different country?

Where would you like to pay taxes and be ready to defend yourself in courts if you get sued?

Delaware has been a defacto place for creating many corporations.  To do this right though get an attorney and a CPA good at taxes and startups to provide better guidance.  I don't know the breakdown of which state is best and have heard that some other states like North Dakota have started to come in favor but Delaware is the defacto and so is the best place to start researching.

Luck
