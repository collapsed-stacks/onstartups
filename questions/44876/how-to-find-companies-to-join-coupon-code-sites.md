I am thinking of starting a new coupon code website. I was just curious about finding companies who wanna open a store and submit coupons on my website. For Example if you see sites like Retail Me Not or Fat Wallet etc. they have hundreds of companies sharing and offering their deals. 

My questions is how do I get started with a brand new coupon site. Should I approach all the companies one by one or should I do something else.

My coupon site would be something like Groupon and I have already started the development.
