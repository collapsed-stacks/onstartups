I had an account at 

domain1.com, with G apps setup.

I setup another account at

domain2.com with another G apps account.

I want to move all my mails from domain1 to domain2 account. How  can I do this?

I am not quite sure if it is possible. I have set different domains at the same G apps accaunt, and it is easy, just add another domain and authenticate it.

<p>I'm pretty sure there is no easy way to do that from the end-user GUI. If you have paid plans you could <strong>try to contact Google support</strong> and ask if they can do it for you (but I'm not hopeful, given Google Support's reputation).</p>

<p>What you <em>could</em> do is to <strong>download all mails to your local PC using Outlook</strong>, and then upload them to the other account using <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/email_uploader.html" rel="nofollow">Email Uploader</a>. Note that Email Uploader is being retired, but the link to the new replacement, Migration for Microsoft Outlook, does not seem to work right now.</p>

<p>I uploaded mails to Google Apps once, and it worked well enough, but it was a bit tricky to set up as I remember -- and it took a long time, 24 hours plus.</p>

<p>If Google Support can't help you, then the above trick is a bit difficult -- can't you just keep both accounts operative, and forward emails from one to the other from now on?</p>

You can download your user list as CSV from https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/doma√¨n.com/EmailAddresses and then upload them into your other account.
