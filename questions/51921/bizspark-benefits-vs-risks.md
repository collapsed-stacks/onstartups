<p>We are a small company started a year ago. Our first planned product is a spa management software and we are tending to develop it as an <strong>ERP</strong> for both service and sales oriented businesses. But soon we realized that the software cannot be done with Visual Studio Express. So we are thinking of applying for <strong>Microsoft BizSpark</strong> program. So, my questions are,

<li> After three years of usage, what if we did not get enough profit to buy a license?</li>
<li> Is it compulsory to buy an <em> MSDN Ultimate subscription </em> after three years?</li>
<li> What are BizSpark <em> Netwrok partners?</em> Is there any difference between applying   through them and applying directly to Microsoft?
<li> Is there any risk factors in this program that I have to concern about?</li></p>

<ul>
<li>You can use BizSpark for 3 years for FREE. </li>
<li>Then you could either buy the licenses, or stop using the software provided by Microsoft. </li>
<li>For you it's doesn't matter whether to apply through the partners, or directly.</li>
<li>I dont' see anything to concern. Microsfot just helps small business for 3 years, and if it helps, most of applicants then buy th elicenses as they earned profit and would like to continue using the same software platform. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are predominantly using Microsoft products, then BizSpark is a great program. </p>

<p>There is no requirement for you to pay anything at the end of the three years, you get to use the software for free, and you get $150 per month to spend on Azure.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go through a partner; I was accepted into the program two weeks ago by submitting my details myself.</p>
