In my last job, we used an on-line tool called [webexpenses][1] to capture and process personal business expenses.  I get the impression it is targeted at medium to larger firms & I wasn't a huge fan, but the concept was neat.  Has anyone found such a service that is designed (read priced) for the small business?  (Services targeted at UK businesses especially interesting.)

Thx in advance for suggestions.
