There are two companies A, and B, that wish to establish company C.

A is a startup software company that gets 60% in C.

B is a profitable hardware company and gets 40% in C. 

This allocation somehow reflects the the generation of initial idea and future R&D required in C.

The C is assumed to combine technology from both A, and B, and by doing so to generate very valuable product - more valuable that each A or B would reach independently. But neither A nor B wishes to sacrifice itself for C at this stage. Also, C will require a lot of additional R&D from both A, and B. 

The technology fields of A and B are very different, so they do not compete and will not compete each other. 

My question is how to create the IP agreement, so it would handle well the following:

1) To be as simple as possible.

2) To maximize motivation of both A, and B to invest their IP into C.

3) To keep A, and B working.

4) To allow for external key technology persons to join C.

5) To avoid IP conflicts in case of sale of C.

We really think that the idea of C has a great value, and don't want papers to prevent us from doing it.

Why not have both A & B execute cross-licensing agreements with C? That way both A & B continue to own any IP they develop independently but C has the right to use it. Further C would own any IP it develops but A & B would be able to use it as well. 

The cross licensing agreements could have a clause dealing with what happens (such as termination) in the event of a sale. It would be easy to negotiate a new agreement as part of the sale.
