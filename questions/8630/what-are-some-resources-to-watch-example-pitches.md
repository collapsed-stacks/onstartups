I like to learn by example so I am trying to find sites that are putting recorded pitches up online. 

Examples would be: 

 - Shark Tank on Jason Calacanis's This Week in Startups - [http://thisweekinstartups.com][1] 
 - Dart Boston's Capitalize - [http://capitalize.dartboston.com/][2]

Does anyone have any others?

Thanks!

<p>A previous Answers.OnStartups question asked about the <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/2312/best-start-up-pitch-videos" rel="nofollow">best startup pitches</a> people had seen. Worth taking a look through.</p>

<p>Some other resources for startup pitches are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pitches.techcrunch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pitches.techcrunch.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/pitchtv/" rel="nofollow">http://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/pitchtv/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vator.tv/" rel="nofollow">http://vator.tv/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And conferences like DEMO and TechCrunch 40 / 50 usually have pitches that are a lot more prepared for (but not necessarily better than) the pitches on sites where anyone can upload.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.demo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.demo.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/companies/" rel="nofollow">http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/companies/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2008/video.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.techcrunch50.com/2008/video.php</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That's probably enough video to keep you busy for years. Don't spend all your time watching other people's presentations. Read up at <a href="http://slideology.com" rel="nofollow">http://slideology.com</a> and <a href="http://presentationzen.com" rel="nofollow">http://presentationzen.com</a>, make a first version of your pitch, and put it up at the first three sites; improve it by getting feedback.</p>
