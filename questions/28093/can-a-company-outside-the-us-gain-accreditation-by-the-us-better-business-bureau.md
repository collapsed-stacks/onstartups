We run an e-commerce business which has many suppliers in the US and many clients there. For this reason we would like to gain accreditation with the BBB. Is this possible unless we have a physical presence in the US?

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-accreditation-standards/" rel="nofollow">BBB Accreditation Standards</a> state that the company must be "based in the United States" or Canada. Unless you meet that, I think the quick answer is no.</p>
