I have created a somewhat unique offering for a Fitness Studio. I have done 95% (or more)  of the leg work, research and development and business plan to bring this plan to life. Two of the partners will be on premises and will be paid market salaries to operate the    business.  
I will manage the business off premises and expect about 20 hours or more per week and plan to not collect a salary. 
Another partner will work on premises at least 12 hours per week or more. 
Finally, though we are forming an LLC, in order to get a lease and possibly a small business loan it MIGHT be necessary for one of us to offer personal collateral. And last but not least our funding is 10, 10, 60 and 60 K.

Are there any standards for equity distribution in such instances?
