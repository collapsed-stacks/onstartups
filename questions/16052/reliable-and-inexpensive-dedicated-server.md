I am looking to dump GoDaddy, the company I was with for the last 5 years or so. Yesterday my dedicated server went down for at least 5 hours. I was not impressed with the support I received and at the end they informed me that my hard-drive is probably about to die and that I needed to move. They want me do do it on my own or charge me for their support, even though, as I pointed out to them, that they sold me a lemon and I am only half-year half through my lease term. Instead I am looking for a new provider, that will send less promotional emails and will provide a better support. My current needs are not that great but I do need a dedicated server.

Any suggestions?

<p>My suggestion - take a close look at the chatter on <a href="http://webhostingtalk.com" rel="nofollow">http://webhostingtalk.com</a> and review the latest offers there.  They have a specific forum for <a href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/forumdisplay.php?f=45" rel="nofollow">latest offers</a>.</p>

<p>Given the phrase "my current needs are not that great" you may want to consider virtual private servers - a good unmanaged xen vps solution will bring you pretty far. review <a href="http://wiki.openvz.org/VPS_vs_Dedicated" rel="nofollow">vps vs dedicated?</a> for some insight. </p>

<p>I've used <a href="http://eapps.com" rel="nofollow">http://eapps.com</a> (dedicated &amp; vps), <a href="http://serveraxis.com" rel="nofollow">http://serveraxis.com</a> (vps) &amp; <a href="http://slicehost.com" rel="nofollow">http://slicehost.com</a> (vps) with good results. </p>

<p>My 2c...</p>

<p>If the needs are not great at the moment and you would love to expand, I would choose a VPS instead of a Dedicated Server. The advantages of VPS's Dynamic allocation of CPU, memory, Disk generally outweigh the Dedicated Server approach..</p>

<p>I have used <a href="https://vpsnoc.com/clients/aff.php?aff=004" rel="nofollow">VPSNOC</a>, and they seem to have one of the best Servers </p>

First of all, don't dispair -- GoDaddy is famous among web developers for being one of the worst hosting services out there.  It's not you, it's them.

I'm with others who said you'd likely be better off with a VPS (virtual private server).

I highly recommend [Linode.com](http://linode.com) as a  provider.  Linode is extremely stable.  Their pricing is reasonable, and their service outstanding.  In addition to using the official support venue (their ticketing system), you have the option of hanging out in the company IRC channel and get answers from other users and help from Linode staff.


*Note: I have no affiliation with Linode, I'm just a web developer and ecstatically happy Linode customer.*

I switched to slicehost VPS, but you have to do all you administration and installation.

Amazon Web Services is launching a free service that will be available to new customers starting November 1. The free service will give AWS customers a free Amazon EC2 Micro Instance for one year. It means that developers get a year to use Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Elastic Load Balancing and AWS data transfer. AWS maintains that the free service allows new users to run anything they want in the cloud. That means the ability to launch new applications or test existing applications. So why not trying it out FREE for a year while you looking for alternatives?

In the days of cloud-computing being all the rage, it makes little sense to stick with dedicated servers that are somewhere not in the scaling-out cloud... ability to have your (even single) server sit behind a load-balancer and a minute's notice scale out to multiple servers indefinitely, is priceless.

Depending on your platform check out Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Rackspace, or a ton of other cloud-computing providers
