Is there a bank where we can set up a business account? We'd like to have as low recurring fees as possible, considering we don't have a single product yet. We're based in Canada if that changes anything.

We need a business account to connect our PayPal account to.

I don't know if it's the cheapest, but check out Coast Capital. We've found their rates to be very startup friendly.
