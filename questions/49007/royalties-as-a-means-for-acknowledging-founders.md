I am in the process of establishing a business with four partners.  Initially the shares were going to be split between the four partners but now it is clear that the majority of the work will be done by two of the partners with the remaining two providing advice.  It has been decided that the shares will be split between the two 'workers' with royalties of 5% each being paid to the two advisers in recognition of the input that they have done to date.  Does this seem an appropriate business structure?  What are the pros and cons of such a structure?  Many thanks - I am delighted to have come across such a forum!

This information is too vague to give a good answer, but a 5% royalty for advice doesn't sound like a great idea on the surface.  Generally speaking, there's only two reasons to return money to anybody involved in a business - work or capital.
