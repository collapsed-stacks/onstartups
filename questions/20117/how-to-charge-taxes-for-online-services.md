We are a Canadian-based incorporated business that is about to sell subscriptions to a SaaS, both yearly and monthly. 

How do we handle adding taxes to the service? Since we are a Quebec-based business, do we charge our customer the Quebec tax rate? If our client is based in any particular province/state, do we charge the taxes of that province/state?

Of note, we are not actually shipping any products, only delivering a service online, so I don't know if the location of the client matters or not.

You really need to ask an accountant. 

I'm based out of Ontario, so we have HST, which is a combination of GST and PST. As I recall, Quebec does not have the harmonized tax, so the rules will be a little different than Ontario.

Usually in Canada, as far as I've been able to determine, you charge tax based on where the service or good is being provided, that is, based on the location of the purchaser. So if I were to sell a service to someone in Manitoba, I would charge GST (since I'm not registered to collect their Provincial tax). In Ontario, I charge HST, and out of the country, I don't collect anything (I think, I don't do many cross-border sales).

Unless you want to register with each province, the only tax you would therefore need to collect is GST, unless you sell to someone within Quebec, in which case the local rate applies. However, every time I've asked Revenue Canada for a ruling, I get a different answer, since even they don't understand how this is supposed to work.

I'll tell you what I am doing in a personal project, though I am not sure it is right.  My software sales are online only and really small -- about $100 a month.  All I know I learned from Google.

I'm only worrying about the laws of my state (Massachusetts).  I *think* that I don't have to worry about the tax laws of other states because I only have a presence in my own state.  That is why you are not charged taxes for many online purchases.

My state recently changed its laws to charge taxes for online software sales where the seller and buyer are both residents of the state.  In my Paypal seller account, I set it up to add Mass. state tax for buyers in Massachusetts.

The U.S. does not yet have nationwide sales tax.  Canada may be different.

See my answer here for a similar question:

Basically, for location based taxes such as sales tax, you need to have a physical presence to actually be subject to sales tax.  If you don't have a physical presence, then you should be ok at the time of the writing of this post, though the tax law changes every day.
