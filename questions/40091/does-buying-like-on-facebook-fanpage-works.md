It may work to make your company look bigger or more popular than it is but if a prospective buyer does notice that your followers seem to be fake people and the interaction on your fanpage is not genuine it will certainly negatively affect your image.

I don't think you ever want to be deceptive and paying for likes, positive reviews, etc. is cheating. Sure, you might see some short term gain but it's not a long term strategy built on trust and quality.
