So i have got this idea for this website, but i would definitely need sponsors for the idea to be established, now i dont know why someone would be interested in the idea i would propose to them, but is it possible to get some sponsors beforehand the development process is started.
if yes, how do i contact them, and what all things i need to keep in mind while i try to convince them. 
Also shall i be presenting the complete detailed idea, or the abstract overview will do, as i guess i might need a creative team for that too, since i dont know what all things i want in my idea are feasible and what are not.(the detailed things).

Karan,

Taking it from the basics, you are looking for what is called seed or first round investors. 

These are typically friends, family, work associates, classmates at uni.

The first things they will want to know:

 - What is it? Not the technical stuff like langauge, platform etc (they won't care) BUT who is the end user of the system? when would I use the system?
 - How much will it cost to get the first thing being used? Forget all the bells and possible what it could be with millions of dollars, focus on the very minimum you need to get the first people using the site and giving you feedback.
 - Once it is established how many people will likely use it in the first 3 months, first year and first 2 years (realistically how many extra people per month ... if it takes off massively great, but what is a realistic growth).
 - How will you make money from it? Are you charging everybody to use it per month or per transaction? are you putting advertising up there? are you taking an amount on transactions made through the site? 
 - How much will it cost roughly in the scaling elements like hosting in at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years sort of numbers ..., offices etc
 - How many people (developers, support, sales/marketing, admin) how much per year per person?
 - How much in advertising and marketing effort will it take to get 10, 100, 1000 users?

Once you know all of that you can say to them 

 - Step 1. Get it over the line, get people to start using it will cost $40K. This is the first block of money you need.
 - Step 2. To get enough people using the site 12 months to break even on fixed costs will take another say $40K. This is the next block of money.
 - Step 3. Find second round investors at $1M in order to hire 5 more people so that we can scale to our target amount.

If they see a plan like that, and they can buy into 15% of the company for the first block 10% for the second block and then if you get to step 3 they can option in buying up to 30% more to get the $1M you need to scale.

The dollar values are purely made up but this is what an investor wants to know

 - How much will it cost
 - How much will I make.
 - How will I make it 

You will need to ask a bunch more questions as you start down this path have a look through the questions people have already asked because they will help you a lot. (Especially the ones marked [CANON] which is the canonical answer)
