I have a few questions about promised milestones to investors.

 1. Is it common to include very specific milestones in the term sheet? 
 2. What are the consequences if you fail to meet them? Losing Board seats?

Thanks

I have never seen term sheets which contain specific milestones like this, but if they did, they would have to also specify the specific consequences of failing to meet them.

A term sheet is just an abbreviated version of what will become a contract, intended to help both sides negotiate the terms of a complicated contract in a concise and simplified form. It would be nonsensical for a contract to specify a milestone without stating what the consequences are of failing to meet it.

In Brazil, where I live, we have never been asked for detailed milestones. When negotiating we had to have a 5-year plan with revenue and profit projections and a high-level product roadmap.
