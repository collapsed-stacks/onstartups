I'm outsourcing a web project to a firm here in the US. I'm being charge $20,000 for a 20 day project, with 2 pretty good developers working on it.

In Western Europe really good developers are typically charged up to $1000 per day here for such small projects.

So I think $500 is really cheap for such small projects.
