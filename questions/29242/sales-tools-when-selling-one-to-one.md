As for many startups, my primary sales channel is via personal network. I am therefore looking for any new or non-traditional equipment or tools to use when the chance for selling suddenly arises. One example could be a mini portable projector to show a presentation of a product. 

Do you have any such tools or equipment, which you can recommend?

Maybe an obvious one, but for our web app, we're going to be acquiring a couple of iPads we can use to whip out a quick demo when we can. It's nice and easy to pass around, and "ooh shiny!" enough to make a good impression in some cases. Other tablets would be just fine too, depending on your exact needs for your demo. If you've got a pitch presentation, it'd be great, and if you're using the iPad you could run a keynote right on there.

The mini-projectors would be helpful and easy to set up, you just need something to project on. But I think a tablet ready for demo is a really great way to maybe wow someone.
