We're a new startup and need a credit card to make some online purchases.  We're looking into options and all of them seem to want at least two years of business history, positive cash flow, etc.  Worst case scenario, we can use our personal credit cards, but was hoping to establish some business credit early on by paying things off monthly.  Any suggestions?

Anybody who will give credit to a company with so little history will require one or more individuals with good personal credit to co-sign as guarantors in case the business flakes out.

There are lots of companies that lease capital equipment that way. Credit cards? I dunno. Look around; Chase keeps advertising their "Ink" cards on TV. You may find it less hassle just to use your personal cards.

If you have a DBA certificate to open a small business checking account, you can sometimes get a credit card through that bank. It will have a very, very low limit like $200-$500, but it's a start. I did this when I opened a real estate business, but I did have good personal credit as well.

if you have cash flow and you don't need to use any overdraft why don't you just get a credit card without and overdraft / debit card?
