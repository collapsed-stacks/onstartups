Appreciate it,

<p>For those who don't why DMOZ is interesting: It's an open, volunteer-driven human-edited directory, like Yahoo! was it in the earliest days. Being listed in DMOZ is said to guarantee crawling of your site by all major search engines, because all search engines have URL feeds from DMOZ.</p>

<p><strong>Today the common advice is: don't bother.</strong> <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=DMOZ%20sucks" rel="nofollow">DMOZ is famously un-responsive to requests for inclusion</a>; it has been this way for many years; and nobody at DMOZ seems to want to change this poor behavior.</p>

<p>More importantly, <strong>the relative benefits of a DMOZ listing have gone way down.</strong> If you have any kind of blogger outreach / organic link building strategy / social media presence / online marketing effort, then you don't need DMOZ. Google et al will index your website as soon as you get a handful of inbound links from other (reputable) sites.</p>

<p>Yahoo! <em>used to</em> take paid inclusions, but no longer does that. The human-edited directory of the web is going the way of the dodo...</p>

I think dmoz is already dead and rather irrelevant despite being used by google - Unless you know an approved moderator its as good as pointless.
