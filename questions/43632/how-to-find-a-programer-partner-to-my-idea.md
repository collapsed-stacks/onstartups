I believe I have a great idea and want to make a website for that. The problem is that i can't find any CMS which fits my needs and my capabilities to develop myself the PHP MySQL solution are very poor.

Is there any website where I can find programmers that want to start a startup but don't have the money (just the developer skills)?

For example: something like http://www.aniboom.com/ but for people who want to participate in my project.

I believe the best approach for you is to find an co-founder who is from technology, not only a freelance programmer.

A person that believes in your idea as well, who will take shares from the company, by developing the solution + getting to know where and how hosting it + in the future, hiring other developers + help with technical specifications when presented to investors + helping **YOU** define some business change from your idea because, very often, things are possible/impossible when someone from technology takes a look on that

You could also seek a partner to finance the development, instead of limiting yourself to developers.

In my experience - there are a lot of great ideas. But turning the idea into a reality is the real challenge. If you found someone who was excited about your idea, had the skills to actually make it a reality, and was willing to do it for free - why would they still need you?

As a PHP/MySQL developer myself, I've had countless people in a similar situation come to me for help. Of the many ideas I'm approached with, scarce few are worth investing in because the fact is everyone has a "great idea" these days! Most of them are just a hunch or intuition with no compelling data to substantiate expectations.

Not being sour - just something to consider from their point of view; hopefully you have a lot to contribute to actualizing the idea as well. An idea is just an idea. I've got lots of great ideas. World peace is a great idea - fat chance finding a partner to implement it for me on a 50/50 split. :D

I am a programmer and have been asked on several ocations to "work with" an individual with a "great idea" this usually means that i will do the work, programming the 'idea' and they will keep most of the shares. As such i am pessimistic of this kind of arrangement.

I would suggest, if you really beleve in your idea you put your money where your mouth is and get a company to develop your idea. 

www.elance.com has lots of developers and a good rating system to help you pick the developer that fits best.

There is http://www.techcofounder.com

But I do not know if this is reliable. Actually I cannot imagine you'll find the perfect match for your idea, but who knows. From what I have learned it is always the best to know a partner for a while and then join forces.
