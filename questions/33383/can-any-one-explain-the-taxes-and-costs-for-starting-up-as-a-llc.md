If I register as a LLC in Delaware and set up a Virtual Office in India, how will I be taxed?

What are the *kind of taxes* that I will see?

Is it better to start a C type single member Corporation? or a LLC.

Can any one explain?

I believe that your tax bracket wouldn't be easy as black and white. For instance, depending whether you are specifically 

* selling items
* performing services
* importing
* exporting

the type of transactions you are reporting; whether these transactions were profit or expenses, in addition to location of the entity you are translating with will determine taxes.

You could probably get away with using tax laws for India as far as business books go, but when filing a tax return in USA the rest of your portfolio will be the determining factor.
