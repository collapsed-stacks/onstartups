This sounds like a situation in which it will be really helpful to speak to a lawyer who has some experience in your domain.

I would recommend--at the very least!--having a contract precisely spelling out what each person's rights and responsibilities will be, and what will happen when things go wrong or if either person wants to terminate the agreement.
