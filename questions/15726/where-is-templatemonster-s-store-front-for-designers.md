I wonder what is the web address (URL) for designers to submit their web template to TemplateMonster?

You could probably earn a lot more through Envato.  They have themeforest.net and activeden.net that are very popular.  They have generous commissions, an affiliate program, and are small enough to care..  

Template monster has a few partnered designers create work for them in low wage countries.  I am sure the comissions would not be as high.

Also consider creating templates for a NICHE.  Admin templates (HTML) do very well.

The best way is to join their affiliate program. In this way you can easily get professional collection with upto great discount.
