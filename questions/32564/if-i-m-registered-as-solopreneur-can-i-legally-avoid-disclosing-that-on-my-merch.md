If I'm registered as solopreneur can I avoid putting something like:

    Joe Doe, <Home address>

and put instead:

    example.com <solo registration number>

on a payment gateway landing page (Paypal, Moneybookers etc.)

The thing is that I want to start(bootstrap) as a solo proprietor in consumer market and want consumers to take the business seriously.

Thanks!

Well, then give your inforation. TONS of small businesses are sole propietors.

Givin fake information does not go well together with being taken serious. People have a right to know whom they deal with, and there are laws what information you have to expose. Inform yourself abou them and follow them.

More then that, this would be illegal. However, the solution is simple. This is what is known as doing business under an assumed name, or "Doing Business As", or just DBA. In most places there is a simple filing at the state or county level where you register that you will be doing business under that name. After that you don't have to give your name, although one reason for the filing is so that anyone could look it up if they want to. If you don't make this filing you CAN'T do business under an assumed name.

One detail, your question shows example.com, which is a web address. You may want to make your business be just "Example".
