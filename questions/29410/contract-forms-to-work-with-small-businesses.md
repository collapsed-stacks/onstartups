I have been working with relatively large companies as a contractor. In that setup, I didn't really concern about "contract" since they provided with all necessary contract forms and I just needed to sign and return them. 

Recently, I started working with small businesses and I found many of small businesses do not have a good process to handle contractors. So I think I may need contract forms before working with them to prevent from getting unnecessary lawsuits or something similar. I tried to find any online resource to build such forms but couldn't do that. May I have to talk to a lawyer for this? Any tip or point to such materials would be appreciated.

<p>They mentioned <a href="http://DocStoc.com" rel="nofollow">DocStoc.com</a> as well. Take a look if it suits your needs. I heard some other sites before but couldn't find them. I'll post when I find..</p>

<p>You might find what you're looking for at ContractEdge.com.  The <a href="http://www.contractedge.com/consultingservicesagreement.html" rel="nofollow">Consulting Services Agreement</a> might be a good fit.</p>

<p>If you're getting into more complex arrangements then you may have to hire a lawyer.  Just know it can get expensive.  I paid over $1,500 for a few agreements last year.  Of course, I did that because I needed an online distribution agreement which covered profit sharing, copyright infringement, and a lot of other concerns I had.  A consulting services agreement is normally a little more straightforward.</p>

<p>Get yourself a good small business lawyer and let him/her develop standard consulting contracts on YOUR behalf. Signing other companies' forms serves their interest, not yours. Grabbing forms online is better than nothing, but still leaves many variables unaccounted for.</p>

<p>I watched a compelling presentation on this subject a few months ago from a well known designer who talked about the value of having solid contracts and a good lawyer on your side (warning - video may not be safe for work due to salty language): <a href="http://vimeo.com/22053820?utm_source=swissmiss" rel="nofollow">F*ck You, Pay Me</a></p>
