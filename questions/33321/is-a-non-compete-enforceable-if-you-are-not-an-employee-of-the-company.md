My wife has an offer from a company in NYC and the contract says specifically that she would be an independent consultant for a 3 month trial period, and not an employee of the company during that time.  It also has a non-compete clause in it.

Neither of us is particularly an expert at the language this contract is written in, but it sounds like she basically wouldn't be able to work in advertising if this company trial period doesn't work out... which would cut out the vast majority of positions available for her expertise.

I have encouraged her to ask to have the clause removed, at least the initial trial contract if they aren't willing to remove it altogether.  Is that even necessary?  Is the non-compete enforceable if she isn't an employee of the company?

Sigh... you'd really better assume nothing. That is an incorrect assumption, most likely. I am not a lawyer. But you need one to review this piece of garbage of a contract. 

> which would cut out the vast majority of positions available for her expertise.

YES. You have perceived this exactly right. They may use this language to essentially force your wife into working exclusively through them. 

Do not even discuss this with the contracting company rep. (a) they are not attorneys and (b) they will dismiss any questions or concerns, probably not understanding the actual law. 

This article recounts "Miller vs. CTG", the aforementioned agency essentially rendering a woman - a contract technical writer - who worked through them unemployable in a large metro area.

Here's some advice. Pay an attorney to look at this contract. Based on his recommendations, line out the terms that are offensive, like this one. Sign it, initial the line outs, and send it back. 

If the agency will not bend on the non compete - a reasonable non compete is to limit you from working for any client of the agency to whom they submit you, for a period of time such as up to 1 year - then I **strongly** recommend walking away and not looking back. 

It's reasonable to say "you can't go around us to work directly for a place that you met through us for a certain time period after the introduction." It's NOT reasonable to say something like "all clients in this industry in a 100 mile radius are potential clients of ours, therefore you must work through us for all of them once you sign our paper." 

You really, really, really have to check the contract wording closely, and this is a proper job for an attorney, not a layman. I suspect that the CTG case revolved around such a clause that didn't seem that dangerous to Stacy Miller at the time. 

The point I am also making here is that even if the scope of the contract seems ridiculous, the agency has much more money at their disposal to make your life miserable than you do to defend your civil rights against them. 

Also, simply do not listen to foolish advice from some techies to ignore the language and sign because "the contract will be thrown out as unenforceable". They are wrong. See paragraph immediately above. 

And learn from this and spread the word that all agency contracts should be scrutinized closely, so that other contractors stop being screwed.

Non-compete's in general are tricky and enforceability is state to state.

But, a non-compete, confidentiality etc. **can** be setup between employees, contractors, anyone.

Enforceability in general is tough. If she is in the advertising business and a contractor, and not hired after a trial period it would be unlikely any court would allow that non-compete to stick. The court would want to see people able to work, and if it is too limiting it won't hold.  But the key word is court. They could try and take her to court if she got a job with their biggest competitor OR directly with one of their clients.  
 
**It seems perfectly reasonable to request the non-compete not be applicable if she is not hired on full time. As it is her profession and she will need to find another job.**

A non-compete is intended especially in situations where you are not or no-longer and employee of the company. For as long as you are exposed to privileged business 'secrets', customer lists, strategy, etc then it makes sense that the recipient of this information be barred from using that information to compete ('steal' clients, employees) etc

Yes, it's enforceable, as long as the non-compete is limited in time, manner and place- e.g., it has to restrict competitive activities for a period of at most a few years, in a specified geographic area and in a certain field.

I'd just ask that the non-compete be deleted, period.

Cross out the parts you don't like - initial the cross outs and send them back.
