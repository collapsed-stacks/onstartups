<p>I'm thinking of using a logo that I created with a <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts" rel="nofollow">Google Web Font</a>. Assuming I can trademark the name, can I also trademark the stylized wordmark, even if I use a font that's licensed under the <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/crete-round" rel="nofollow">SIL Open Font License</a>? </p>
