Let's say I expect to generate $500/month of steady income from my side company (single member LLC). I work FT during the day and taxes are paid accordingly. Do I need to worry about estimated taxes, assuming my withholdings are reasonable (S1)?

What happens if I don't file my estimated taxes?

EDIT: I live in the US and recently got married. My wife's W4 is S0 while I'm M1. I may change mine to M0 to offset her large refund.

No. If you are employed, and your employer is withholding enough taxes to account for **all** of your income, you do not have to file estimated taxes.

If your employer is currently not withholding enough, all you have to do is file IRS Form W-4 with your employer to increase the amount they withhold.

This is assuming you are in the US.

<p>You haven't indicated if you live in the US, as Zuly noted, so I too am assuming this.</p>

<p>If you wind up owing more than $1,000 in taxes, you have not withheld enough and are subject to penalty: (Source: <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306.html" rel="nofollow">IRS Website</a>).  </p>

<p>So the question is, how close is your withholding to your actual tax liability?  If every year you get a refund of $1,000 and you're in the 28% tax bracket, you don't need to worry about prepayment on an extra $6,000/yr of income.  But if you're in a 28% tax bracket, and you pay $1,000 every year when you mail your tax return, then you should be looking into making quarterly payments (of, say, $400).   </p>

<p>You can read about how to make quarterly payments by looking into the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=242581,00.html" rel="nofollow">1040 ES</a>.  This will become more important as your side income grows, which hopefully it will! </p>

You are employed and holding a side business. Have you looked into potential conflict of interests? Your employer can potentially claim IP developed at your side business without the legal aspects resolved.
