<p>As for finding startups online, you might want to do a simple search on <a href="http://twitter.com/" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://pb.ly/" rel="nofollow">pb.ly</a>, and <a href="http://wefollow.com/" rel="nofollow">wefollow</a> for those who have the words entrepreneur, startup, or founder in their bio. You could also search existing /startup lists on Twitter. </p>

<p>There are also a couple of startup/entrepreneur specific communities for networking, such as <a href="http://sprouter.com/" rel="nofollow">Sprouter</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.efactor.com/" rel="nofollow">EFactor</a>.</p>

<p>The above are all free, but if you're willing to pay, you could get a premium <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a> account that allows you to search for people according to their industry, seniority, company size, and other advanced search options.   </p>

you will need to clarify your target market.. Startup is a broad term. It is very different to try reaching startups that are doing their business online, and therefore are very accustomed to online. Those guys you will fine in forums, conferences sites, VC sites, Angel groups sites  and things like that. Do you search based on target industries as you will find specialized site to list them. If you are targeting startups that are more traditional like a Boulangerie, a restaurant or a barber, that might want to advertise online or might need your services but doesn't really make a business of it, it becomes much much harder because you will certainly need a local presence. You have to become visible to them so they can find you (SEO, Forums, blogs, etc..) and really pay attention to your link building and keyword targeting in that regards.

Let us know
