I'm working on a tech startup and trying to make some rough financial forecasts. Has anyone ever hired a lawyer to draw up an EULA for a web app (we are hoping to sell skinned, customized versions of our app for intranet use, if it helps)? How much did it cost? I am pretty ignorant about legal stuff, and I just want a range or ballpark. I'm in Canada, but US figures would also help me out. 

Thanks!

I'd shop relationship rather than primarily price. You'll need him/her for other things along the way so invest in an ongoing relationship. 

You're paying by the hour and lawyers are glad to spend your money doing anything and everything related to your legal requests. You can often save money by doing a bunch of the ground work yourself and bringing a focused, specific request to the attorney. 

For an EULA, look around at existing/similar license agreements and find one or more that you like (i.e. short & sweet vs long & exacting). Google and read a little bit. Take the time to understand what you want to accomplish with an EULA. Take one or more examples of what you're looking for to an attorney for review and specific tailoring to your product/business needs. This is generally way less time consuming than showing up and saying 'I need a license agreement.'

I got one made at $500 at webtm.com (Gordon Troy).

I believe it was discounted however so don't know if you could get the same price.

From a reputable law firm that will do a good job (and will hope for future business): a few thousand dollars.  I agree with the above post- find one you like and do much of the legwork yourself, and then get a law firm to just fix it.  Tell them that you do NOT want a super-polished product; if the lawyer spends 75% of the time it takes to get a perfect product, the EULA will be 95% ready (it just may have typos and bad formatting, but nothing that you can't fix yourself).
