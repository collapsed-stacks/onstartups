It's tough to believe something as simple as bit.ly can have large corporate clients.

It makes you wonder, after all those days developing games or web apps, is perceived simplicity of usage and application a deciding factor in a saas startup?

I'm sure bit.ly wasn't the first... what are the common characteristics of twitter, facebook, and other successes? More important, what is the deciding factor of failing?

I do not understand consumer SaaS and why they are so huge... most of these startups are free, and depend on ads.

Why haven't business SaaS taken off as much? I thought java EE was deployed everywhere, so it's SaaS intranet right?

Don't confuse simple to use with simple to build. I think the new ATMs that scan paper check and cach deposits are pretty simple to use, but not simple to build and maintain. 

The example you give with bit.ly is pretty easy to setup a shorter link, but what about the analytics behind this thing? There could be some heavy-duty stats going on there. The aggregation and analysis of massive amounts of data is never easy.

+1 on Jeff, and then:

If *anyone* could answer the question: Which ideas are valuable and result in successful businesses, and which don't?  That person would make lots of money.
