I've checked other questions but none cover the topic of past contributions. I'm wondering **how much weight does time spent before incorporating matter**.
Do Founder A earlier contributions have enough weight to change the ownership split? 

Is a 50/50 situation stable enough for decision making in the long term considering there are clear roles & responsibilities?

Joel Spolsky goes through a plan along these lines in great detail here:

As long as it doesn't cause resentment, 50/50 could work with some points you need to remember:

 - Even starting at 50/50 doesn't mean it will stay that way for long. For example, the accelerator will take a 4-10% cut.
 - Have a vesting schedule based on time with the organization.
 - *No one* gets their shares up front.. though the vesting schedule could have started in the past. This is called "backdating" and you must **absolutely talk with an attorney** to make sure it's done properly.

Most likely the accelerator has a lawyer or three on staff to advise on these exact issues.
