I have a very good idea for a website... but I don't have the capital to really get it going. Does anyone know any good, and TRUSTWORTHY investors that wont screw me around and end up owning half of my company? My site has the potential of becoming as big as craigslist. There's no way I can explain to you, without giving up my idea, why I feel my idea is huge. Please work with me and pretend like I just came up with craigslist and tell me what you think...I know, it's a stretch.

Most "good, trustworthy investors" don't invest in ideas; they invest in teams and/or traction.

If this idea is as good as you think it is, go find a partner who can build it while you market the heck out of it. Get 10,000, 50,000, or even 100,000 users first, and then think about raising money.

If you do find an investor who will put money into a first-time founder with just a "brilliant idea," they're either crazy, untrustworthy, or very likely to want 50% or more of the company. But I have trouble imagining a scenario in which someone who has never before founded a startup gets funding for "the next Craigslist" without having built any piece of it first.

"Ideas" don't get funded by those who can't afford to fund them.

Generally speaking, if you have a good idea (and nothing more) you MUST have a top-notch team, track record of success and a solid network...

you could look into grants or microloans for startups if you are in the US.  Then build it on a cloud platform so it scales and do it all under a corporate name(cost to incorporate about $200 with legalzoom).  Then if it doesn't take off, the company just dies and you have no credit problem.
