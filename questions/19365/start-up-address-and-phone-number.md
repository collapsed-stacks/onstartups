What are people's perspectives on a start-up that has or doesn't have a physical location or phone number listed on their website?

My site is currently still in Beta and I am still making adjustments where it makes sense.  One of the comments I received from Beta testing related to address and phone number.  How important is that to be listed?  Do you think a site like mine needs that?

Will having an address and phone number listed legitimize my site more?  Or will it hinder it until it is more established?

It's the "kiss of death" when I looking for a product or a service. If there is no contact information there is no sale from me.

A **serious** business has an address and it has a phone number.

It's more to do with making the customer feel comfortable that he / she can call up if there's a problem. A location might not be that necessary, but a phone number is needed.

<p>Contact information is important but it doesn't have to include a phone or physical address if you are not selling a physical product and you just deal with individuals.</p>

<p>Personally, as long as you have an email address (or even a contact form) I'm happy - I will probably send a very simple request to see how long it takes you to reply and judge on that. If you can only respond to emails during certain times let me know that on the site (either in my local timezone or in GMT - preferably both).</p>

<p>My personal rule is - if it's over $US 500 in a single transaction I do want an address, phone number, company details etc in case you rip me off. Under that it's a matter of '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_emptor" rel="nofollow">Caveat emptor</a>' and I'll simply block future charges from you to my credit card.</p>

<p>When you are primarily dealing with companies you will want to make that information available or they will not deal with you. If you occasionally deal with businesses it may be enough for them to contact you via email for full company information (which will probably also include tax information, business registration information, physical address, etc).</p>

<p>From the looks of your site you deal with both - perhaps a split sign up form? One for business which provides phone and physical address information and another for job seekers that doesn't include that information.</p>

<p>However, if you don't supply an address or phone number don't ask me for mine as a client though - I won't give it to you. Email address so you can contact me - sure, name and address for credit card verification (through a valid billing system) no problems. Do not ask me for that information simply to sign up though - I don't expect it from you, don't expect it from me.</p>

<p>Regards,
ShaneG</p>

<p>It is not hard to have an address, just go to a <a href="http://www.theupsstorelocal.com" rel="nofollow">UPS Store</a> or some other private post office box company. If you don't want to be interrupted/inundated with calls, get a <a href="http://magicjack.com" rel="nofollow">Magic Jack phone number</a> for $19.95 a year and have it go straight to voicemail. These are minimal investments that provide a feeling of security to your customer base. You owe them that much.</p>

You're asking me to trust you that you'll connect candidates with my vacancies? The *least* I want back is to know how to find you. 

And given the work I'm hiring you to do, I think I want to know I can reach you on the phone if there's an issue.

When you're a huge success, you can (if you must) hide with impunity. But not now.

It's not uncommon for fake job sites to harvest job hunters email/phone details for nefarious purposes so I'd recommend a contact phone number and address to help with legitimacy. 

A virtual office address with mail forwarding, phone forwarding and screening can be had for around $20-100/month. You could also look at Google Voice, Skype or similar services.
