I would like to build a user friendly augmented reality web platform. Users would able create point of interests and features(lets call them "realitys") using an API similar to Google maps. Users in turn, using the AR mobile/side will then be able to specifically select the type of "reality" they would like to view. i.e. find rent/housing listings through the phone, locate a list of restaurants relative to your location recommend by a local foodie, or find an event near you. 

Any body on here get what im saying?

I get what you are saying but I assume you potential users are not all PhD-s :)
If you want a users to understand it, you can try to explain this in terms of what the user problems are and how it solves it. Explained in this way it seems more like a solution looking for problems to solve.

And you question is?
