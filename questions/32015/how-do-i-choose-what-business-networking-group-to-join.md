Rotary, Masons, Elks, BNI, LinkedIn Groups, Meetup Groups, Company of Friends, Cooltea, EYPN, NetParty, PowerMingle, Jaycees, First Tuesdays, Knowmentum  . . .. 

I don't have time to become and active member of them all -- and I can't for the life of me find anyone who has written a good analysis of the different organizational culture from the perspective of evaluating and choosing the "right one" for me. 

Bottom line: I can't figure out which one to join. 

How do I choose? What are the variables? What should drive the ROI evaluation?

Some of the organizations that you listed - Rotary, JayCees - are service organizations whose primary reason for existence is charitable projects. Others, like BNI, exist purely and specifically to share leads and to network in order to build up the member's businesses. 

Some, like chamber of commerce, may try to be all things to all people - a lead sharing organization + service - but wind up only serving as an ego crutch so that some members can feel important (my experience.) 

Also, I have found that real service organizations tend to look down on someone joining simply to bolster a business. It's stupid because most people need to get ahead but that's the politics of it. 

So, first do a cut based upon the time, level of commitment, and effort that you plan to expend for the sake of group membership. 

With this shorter list in hand, you will simply have to attend a few meetings of each in order to learn their chemistry and flavor and how they operate and what their structure is. No reputable group should have a problem with "auditing" their meetings. 

It's quite possible that some sound good on paper but you don't like the individuals or the politics that you encounter.

How do I choose? What are the variables? What should drive the ROI evaluation?

What are your Goals for your Networking?  What do you want to achieve?  If you cannot answer these you may well have a tough time choosing.

Here are a few tips for choosing a group.
1.  Time and Location - you have to make sure it fits your schedule.
2.  Know What you want from the group - support, prospects, referrals, every group is different.  If you are looking for Business Referrals you might want to consider joining a closed contact group, for support a mastermind group, for prospects a chamber or association, and for connections and relationships that give back to the community also, service groups like Rotary.
3.  Do some research.  What are the rules, how long have they been around, how can you get involved, what are the fees, is there exclusivity for your profession.
4.  Visit several groups, decide if you like the energy and the people.  Ask them questions, like how long have they been members, have they been successful, ask to be introduced to others in the room.
5.  Check with others in your personal network and find out where they are networking and ask if you can be their guest.
6.  If you join, get involved!  Don't join and wait for something to happen, make it happen.

No Richard Branson does not go to those groups listed.  But he does indeed have a powerful network.  When he was starting out, he too networked and connected, the most powerful and valuable item that Richard Branson or any other person owns is their Network.  Develop in when you don't need it, and it will be there when you do.

None of the above. You think Richard Branson goes to those things? Pshaw. Maybe as a paid speaker!

Make your own. Keep a list of your industry peers that you know in your hometown. Pick a date and email them once a month inviting them to join you for dinner at a nice restaurant. I've found that if you have a list of about a dozen people, you'll get about six people who can actually make it on the arbitrary date you pick.

You'll find that even if you've only met them once or twice, inviting them to a group dinner of peers is not even remotely weird :)

How far you take it is up to you... I know people who have done this and gotten to monthly 50-person breakfasts, and others who carefully keep their group under 10.

I would go with Joel's answer- none of the above. But that doesn't answer your actual question. So....

First divide the different groups into those where you can measure ROI and those where you can't. For example, **no one** joins the Rotary, Masons, Elks to get an ROI. If something does come from joining one of those groups- it's an un-measurable accident.

Second, list the rest of the groups. 

 1. Which of those groups can you sell your product or service to, or use to sell your product or service?
 2. Which of those groups can provide advice or help in selling your product?

If you can only join a limited number of groups, decide whether 1. or 2. above is more important to you. Then look for restrictions or limits *(on what you are allowed to do promotion wise)* in each of the groups that remain in those categories. That should whittle things down to a manageable level.

I think being involved in:

 - One physical group dedicated to generating sales leads (BNI)
 - One physical group focused on community efforts (Rotary)
 - Couple online communities 
 - One you craft of your top referrers and non-competing business partners

I was in BNI for a year but have since got involved in a group where people are more hand picked and there are no franchises or herbal supplement salesman ;)  -  Joel's recommendation of a dinner is excellent, that is also recommended in Keith Ferrazzi's book Never Eat Alone and I think that is great advice.
