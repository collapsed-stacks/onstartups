I am basically involved in wordpress site development but a self starter for rails. I want to transform my idea into a rail app and I am contributing it on git(at a very initial level this time), but the thing is due to money concerns I cant quit my job to very actively participate in for develoment and cant create a startup for transforming my idea so internet is the only source left to me.

Now my question is where do I find people that are willing to contribute or HELP to my git project or helping me with ideas/suggestions for my project(Apart from stackoverflow as these days basic/elementary questions mainly down voted but that is separate issue and leaving this time). My friends are mostly working in another technologies and I am living in a remote area and searched for groups/communities in my locals as well but unable to find any.

In one of my previous posts on stack site someone suggested me meetup site but its a paid service and found no group in my locals.

I am ready to contribute for other git projects based on Rails for my learning purpose but I am unable to locate any on internet.

I'll quote myself here:

> “Release, release, release. Until you release, everything else is just talk. Before there’s real code to share, no one cares what you’re doing and almost no one will help.”

I would also suggest reading Karl Fogel's "Producing Open Source Software" to learn about starting, running, and maintaining a project. It has changed my career and mindset.

There are hundreds - if not thousands - of Rails (or better, Ruby) projects on Github. If you haven't found any, look harder.
