Ok there is a **startup idea** in place; Not a big thing!
Even the plan is **99%** on paper; Considerably not bad!
Two fellows have shown faith in the plans and **agreed to partner**; good considering team is what matters in first place!

> What lacks currently is a developer
> within the team and/or funds to hire
> one or more.

We are not ready to quit this idea or dump it in our closet. We have a basic revenue model working for it.

What can get us going now?
How do we find that developer/coder or a little funding to hire?

*(F&F for seed fund is not really going to work as the idea is not too common or simple)*

<p>Assuming your idea is technology-play, then, few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn to code. Now.</li>
<li>Find technical co-founder. Shake your friends / colleagues tree and see which one is convinced to join you. Otherwise, start network with people. Attend meet-up or join local tech communities. Search <a href="http://meetup.com" rel="nofollow">meetup.com</a> see if there are any in your cities.</li>
<li>Outsource the development through services like <a href="http://www.elance.com/" rel="nofollow">Elance</a>. It is not that expensive if you live in developed countries. The downside is you have to put up with all the communication/cultural hurdles.</li>
</ol>

Find a developer that you can take on as a partner, and be ready to give him a substantial percentage.

There are no other way besides start learning how to code and propose for funding after your application becomes something usable.

**EDIT**

I was once met someone that offer me to start a startup and told me to do the coding, but I backed out straight away. Idea without implementation is nothing. Rather than do the coding for someone else that only have an idea, it is more beneficial if I do it myself. ;) You have no other choice but to learn to code because many programmers has these kind of mindset these days. Now get down to it.

First, check your network to see if there's a developer there who might be interested in joining you. You mention that you already have 2 partners, yet no programming skills between the three of you. You haven't mentioned what each of you is bringing to the table already, so you may not have a good founder balance as it is. 

If you're going to pay the technical founder with equity, since funds are scarce, you need to be aware that they may demand a fairly high percentage of the company, since without them, you have nothing. At the same time, you need to retain enough of the company to ensure that you are capable of raising funds later, should that prove necessary.

Last, if you're going to hire someone, either put the project up for bidding on a site such as eLance, or be prepared to pay the going rate for the work you need. Take a guess at how many hours you think it will take to build, multiply by 3 (it's amazing how far off non-technical people estimate technical work to take, and 3 is assuming you're okay at it), and then multiply that by $50. If you don't have those kinds of funds, you'll have a hard time getting quality work for pay.

Find a 4th who can code. Equity would be based on the level of commitment. 

If you want someone to put in 40-80 hrs/week and ask them to forego all other income, they will want a lot of equity (others have noted this in their answers). You may be able to do a combination of minimal pay to help with the bills along with equity without giving up half the company.

Depending on the aptitude and interest in learning to code, you could do it yourself, but ask yourselves the question why haven't you learned to code yet? You have access to a computer, the Net with lots of tutorials, free development tools, hosting, etc.
