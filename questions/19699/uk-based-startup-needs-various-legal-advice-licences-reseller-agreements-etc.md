I'm a UK based startup and need a good legal advisor. Will most lawyers be able to help a web/software based startup with areas such as product licenses, reseller agreements, NDAs etc or is it best to find a specialist? Can anybody recommend a lawyer that works with UK based software  companies / startups?

Stanley,

There is a plethora of legal firms out there that will be willing to assist you, first port of call would be to your accountant to see who they would recommend. 

However, before you even go down that route, I would see what you can get on line as quite often, the documents that you need are available for free or a small charge. I just had a quick dig around and came up with these 2 below, it neednâ€™t be so arduous, just have a quick search and you may find it there already.

Stanley - I have an excellent lawyer who worked really well with my last startup (which was acquired) and does work for me now in my new startup (currently one-man-band) - email me (contact details in my profile) directly and I'll forward you her details.

Kind regards - Steve.
