## Is this called a "distributor" relationship or something else?

What should I call a business arrangement where I'll have the ability to buy raw material in bulk at wholesale prices, package and label the individual sellable units myself (and even create new SKUs), and set my own prices... but also be able to use the original manufacturer's brand name and logos?  

I was thinking this was a generic distribution arrangement but then as I was looking up sample Distribution Agreements, I came to be under the impression that distributors just distribute the finished SKUs.  Am I mistaken here?  Or do "distributors" also participate in the end-product creation process?  Is there another, better name for this type of relationship?

<p>The closest type of relationship / agreement I can think of is OEM (for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer" rel="nofollow">Original Equipment Manufacturer</a> - term came from the auto industry).</p>
