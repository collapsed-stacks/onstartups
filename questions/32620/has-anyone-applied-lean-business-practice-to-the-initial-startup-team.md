Instead of thinking about the "product" and iterative cycles of prototyping while building a community who will be your future market, has anyone played with simultaneously iterative cycles of company formation? That is, extending the lean process to include company formation as part of the iterative process?

<p>Eric Reis's Lean Startup methodology was heavily influenced by Steven Blank's '<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0976470705" rel="nofollow">The Four Steps to the Epiphany</a>'.  I would recommend that book if you'd like to hear a discussion of the lean startup principles that puts more focus on the non-product aspects.  For example, Blank talks about building your startup culture, organizing the company components, and when to built out the various departments.</p>
