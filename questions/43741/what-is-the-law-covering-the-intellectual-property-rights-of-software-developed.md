## What is the law covering the intellectual property rights of software developed during internship/employment without signed contract/agreement?

I am a software engineer who "invented", and developed alone an integrated ERP software solution over the past 2 years. I got the idea and coded much of the software as intern at small wholesale retailer (company A) with which I had a verbal agreement that I could keep the IP rights to the code and the company would have the "shop rights" to use "a copy" of the software without restrictions.

Recently things started to take a down turn in the company A as the company grew fairly large and new head management was formed, also new partners were brought in. The original owners distanced themselves from the business, and the new group indicated that they want to claim the IP rights to my software, offering me a contract that would split the IP ownership into 50% co-ownership, completely disregarding the initial verbal agreements.


As of now **there was no single written job description and agreement/contract/policy that I signed with the company A**, I signed only I-9 and W-4 forms. I now have an opportunity to leave the company A and form a new business with 2 partners (Company B), obviously using the software as the primary tool. There would be no direct conflict of interest as the company A sells furniture. 

**My core question is: "am I better off just leaving with the software without anything signed, or should I fight the contract and resolve the issue with lawyers? (FL, US)"** 

**Detailed questions:**

 1. Given the situation, where no signed legal agreement is present, I created the software partially as an intern and no-contract employee, and "the invention" is not in direct conflict of interest with the company A, and I always used my personal computer/servers to code/host the files on.. **What is the applicable law governing the copyright and intellectual properties of the software in such case? If nothing is signed and I leave the company A tomorrow, who by default owns the IP/copyright to the code?** I am concerned only with the US law, and local state law in south Florida (District 11)
 2. I am familiar with the "shop rights", I don't have any problem leaving a copy of the code in the company for them to use/enhance. What worries me, **Can the company A make any legal claims to the software/code/IP and potential derived profits/interests after I leave and form a company B?**
 3. **Can applying for a patent/registering the software at [http://www.copyright.gov][1] in my name prevent any legal disputes in the future? Can I uset it as evidence for legal defense? Could adding a note specifying the company A as exclusive license holder clarify the arrangements?**
 4. **If I leave and the company A sues me, what evidence would they use against me? On what basis would the sue since their business is in completely different industry than software (wholesale goods). Every single source file was created/stored on my personal computer with proper documentation including a copyright notice with my credentials (name/email/addres/phone).** It's also worth noting that I develop significant part of the software prior to my involvement with the company A as student.
 5. **If I am forced to sign a contract and the company A doesn't honor the verbal agreement, making claims towards the ownership, what can I do settle the matter legally?** I like to avoid legal process altogether as my budget for court battles is extremely limited at the moment.

Few points for clarification:

 - *I want to clarify that there was never hidden intent on my part, I was very transparent with the company A from the beginning, both parties agreed on the arrangements several times during the 2 years*
 - *The software was not made specifically for the company A, even though they use it for their operations. The software was designed to be as generic as possible so it can be used by other business in virtually any products/services industry, the company A was just a guinea pig as they were the first to use it, they agreed to this before the software was made*
 - *The company was not looking for the software solution when they approached me, I basically brought my old code in, enhanced it and created my job there*
 - *There was no management/guidance that would affect my work, I was "my own boss" with no other persons in the company involved in software in any way. There is no know-how of the company A in the software*
 - *No specific procedure/method/secret that would be considered confidential is embed in the software, the company A owns their run-time data and has access to it (databases)*


That's it. Thank you for your time reading my post, this is big deal for me personally as well as professionally. Any useful answers/thoughts/experiences are much appreciated, and for them I thank you in advance. I understand that this is not legal advice/service, I only hope to get some input.

*Sincerely,
PT*

I also strongly advise that you contact a competent workplace rights lawyer in the state where the business is headquartered. 

IANAL, but I've been in a similar situation and as I was also paid for the work I did, I'm sure they can easily make the argument that you produced the system as a work-for-hire irrespective of any documentation or lack thereof.

Sadly when there is ambiguity like this on which to hang a lawsuit, the law doesn't matter very much because the outcome of any action is strongly biased by the economic disparity between the plaintiff company and you.

I will keep this post short - but rest assured - **you own the software plain and simple**. Ask your lawyer to confirm that.

This is a completely legal matter and you need to reach out to a workplace rights lawyer in Florida preferably with exposure to IP litigation in court - **ask for references**.

Forget about what you have read so far in books and on the internet about rights defaulting to the employer: these assume some situations that does not apply.

You have enough to display & stand in court: I do not want to elucidate - the lawyer will do that for you.

Also, **focus on what *littleadv* told you: you do have a few written agreements about your employment**!

That can go against you.

Consider your employer's document you had to submit to be approved for the OPT. It specifies clearly about a webmaster position "with the scope of enhancing their e-commerce opens source system".

If the prosecution gets a good lawyer with an understanding of software, they can yank out the frontend to the ERP software you developed (the backend, and thankfully the "real deal" should be safe though).

**Show him this thread and ask him if it would like to take it down in case some facts do not align with your final defense.**

Be assured - **there exists a verbal but legal contract** and if either of the original partners stand by you, you are good and **you can not only win but recover all your litigation fee** based on how your lawyer sets the agreement.

I would recommend you ask the partner who is willing to endorse your visa in his well established company (company C) to **go ahead *before* you begin litigation**.

You indeed can legally own shares of company B but without drawing a salary how do you intend to live? (Hence my comment)

Yes, you can be an employee of company C while working on company B but I am pretty sure you will have to give up majority stake in company B to the person from company C who are helping you out.

Is that what you want? **You don't need to give up majority stake in company B at all if you time this right**.

Be careful of having tunnel vision and focusing only on this case - **look at how your decisions will affect your life for years to come**!

For example - payslips are all important in everyday personal finance here in the U.S. (Loans, credit cards, ..) **and necessary for you** to continue your status.

Focus on getting a settlement before going to the courts.

Lean towards closed arbitration: ensure this does not go on public record.

The point is to reduce your exposure to the public as starting your business based off litigation might not be a very good idea.
