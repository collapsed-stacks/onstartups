This probably goes along with how to attract customers to a website. But im just curious if anyone knows how to market a product thats available in the physical world and not some web service online?

I believe there are so many constraints to marketing a product thats physically available, one being that users have no access to it unless you send it to them. So im hoping someone has already done this so you can give me some advice :)

<p>How do you turn a physical product into a web best seller? With video!</p>

<p>If you are able to create short videos that show your product being use in real-life scenarios, focusing on the features that make it unique, you'll be able to have people "experience" it without actually having to use it.</p>

<p>Done well, this can turn into a viral campaign. </p>

<p>A good example is the blender's <a href="http://www.blendtec.com/willitblend/videos.aspx?video=iphone" rel="nofollow">campaigns around the "Will it blend?"</a>. Here you you see a crazy scientist shredding everything from brooms to iPhones, just demonstrating how good the blender is.</p>

<p>Apple also uses video very well to show how unique their products are (take the iPhone and iPad videos, where you see the product in the center, and user's hands using the touch screen - the unique feature - and showing how cool and easy to use the product is).</p>

<p>On the low-cost end, you have a great example from 'Rock-it', a gadget that can turn any surface into a loud speaker for your iPdod. <a href="http://www.business-opportunities.biz/2010/02/23/inventor-launches-rock-it/" rel="nofollow">In this page, the inventor does a home demonstration</a> of how it works, in the kitchen, with whatever he can get his hands on to use as a loud-speaker. Simple, low-cost, but damn effective!</p>

<p>As a final (and completely different) example you have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsY6eaKsFW4" rel="nofollow">Ronco Rotisserie</a> TV infomercials . The whole product was designed to be sold on TV (for example the glass door is diagonal, to allow the cameras to film what's inside without any glare from the projector lights of the studio).</p>

<p>If you can show it well on the web, people will want to buy it in the real world.  </p>

<p>I think it depends what it is - you need to find the people who might care about your product and get them talking about it.  For example, if it is a gadget, you would try and get the guys at <strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/" rel="nofollow">EnGadget</a></strong> interested.  Perhaps you could post some more detail about the field it's in and then you may get some more specific advice.</p>

<p>If it is a brand new product concept in the high-tech area, then I would recommend you read Geoff Moore's <strong><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0066620023" rel="nofollow">Crossing the Chasm</a></strong> as that will give you some sound ideas about how to market and who to market to in the early stages, and then how to get your product into the mainstream.</p>

Here's a case in which we had to attract interest to a product (restaurant).

In our city there are more businesses than there are consumers. The product had reached beyond market saturation so there was nothing particularly unique or niche about the restaurant when compared with its competitors. So what we did was redefine the experiences people had there. We put up a foosball table in a spot that wasn't really seeing a lot traffic and set up an old arcade system purchased off ebay for cheap, and now kids are hanging out after their meals. The mood completely changed and the business was longer "that restaurant that serves the same food as those other places," but "the place where you could play games." I don't think people go to that restaurant to eat anymore. I think they're just there to play games.


Here's another scenario revolving around bands at a bar.

This area is filled with live venues where bands go to play. One bar always seemed to get by better than the other bars. The reason why is because they stacked their sets. While all the other businesses booked from the same pool of bands, 2 at a time, the Stafford was the only place that booked 5 bands at any given night. Now each band has their own dedicated following, and for a bar it's especially critical to have a consistent minimum of people for there to be social fluidity. So when one bar books these two bands each with 25 people they get 50 total that come in and out randomly never triggering that minimum amount to retain the clientele. Well when the Stafford books those same two bands and 3 more with their own following of 25 a piece, then that minimum amount is immediately achieved and everyone stays and then eventually the place becomes packed.

Diversify appeal, identify the tipping point for sustained growth.


While it's important to have a phenomenal product, we're in the age of phenomenal products. Everything is awesome. There's not enough money for all the cool stuff we can get. I want a wii, a better tv, a new kitchen, etc. All of these things have fixed costs. But people don't have fixed costs. So the most cost effective thing you can do is to create a mechanism centered around your product that can bring people together. Because traditional marketing doesn't work anymore and neither does advertising. Heck, if I want to be entertained hours on end I can just turn on my computer, watch hulu, have a beer in the comfort of my home talking to you guys. 

When something becomes ubiquitous then it is no longer something unique in and of itself. It's just more of the same. We've already moved from a product based economy to a service based economy, and now I think we're in the transition from a service based economy to an experience based economy. (That's just what I've heard. I'm not expert on the matter.) So the next best thing to material goods and synthetic based happiness is real human states triggered by other people.

Best of luck

Almost every physical product is sold through a channel, unless you are selling your product directly to the consumer.  

If you are selling directly to the consumer than you should be looking at sites like Ebay and Amazon.  You should also set up your own website and develop a good affiliate program.  Finding quality affiliates can be a lot of work but if you can make them profitable they will continue to sell your product for you.

If you are not selling to consumers than you need to understand how similar products go to market.  Most are sold through a channel, for example they move from the manufacturer to a distributor to a reseller and finally to an end user.  This is common for most products from electronics to produce.  If you physical product is well suited for web sales then I would be looking at distributors and resellers who carry similar products.  For example in my line of work a company like AVAD who resells the products from about 100 manufactures.

Depending on your product you may want to look at local resellers. If your selling hand made products or things you often see at local markets this may be a good fit. Many small companies get their start by approaching local stores to sell their products.  This will allow you to gradually grow your business through sales revenue as you continue to search for larger opportunities.  
  
Hope that helps.
