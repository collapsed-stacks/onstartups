Any major at Stanford University will expose you to entrepreneurship ;-)

I appreciate the idea, but I'm sorry to have to give some slightly bad news: **There is no course that teaches "exactly how to make money".**

Universities are pretty good at what they do, and they do provide a lot of value. That said, universities teach:

 - The *theories* behind business. That's good, but to actually make money you have to implement the theories in practice, and this is not a perfect step.
 - Universities mostly teach what is *studied in depth*, said a little harshly solid solutions to the problems of 10 years ago. Most large fortunes are made in market disruptions, where the rules have all changed recently.

Don't take this the wrong way, I'm very much in favor of formal education for entrepreneurs. But no education can provide an "exactly how to make money" roadmap for you.

You can do an entrepreneurship major at University. Look for a program that not only teaches theory but gets you to apply it in real world situations.

I know Babson College and Stanford both have good programs with a practical component - and there are others

<p>Babson is <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/entrepreneurship" rel="nofollow">currently #1 in Entrepreneurship</a>. I'm finishing my MBA from Babson tomorrow and I can assure you that even the best program does not teach you how to make money. </p>
