<p>We have completed building a minimum viable product and now it is ready for the test. Can I now incorporate the company before its testing is complete?</p>

<p>If your company is hinging on the success of the test, I would recommend to wait for the formation of the corporation. Depending on the state (or country) you live in, the costs can be high. </p>

<p>However, if you wish to form the corporation which you can, I recommend speaking with the office responsible to see if you qualify.</p>
