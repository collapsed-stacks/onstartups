I am an Entrepreneur and I have plenty of experience running my own business online successfully for the past 12 years, but I have a new project that really fills a need, and I know what needs to be done, but I know there are people better suited than me to manage the project and the business, so I am looking for one of them.

It is a community of sorts that we are building, and the frame work is built and the site is in beta currently, but I need someone who can keep the flywheel spinning once we get it going.  Following up with contributors and content providers, etc.

Will the right person please stand up!

I am an aspiring entrepreneur so I'm possibly not the most qualified to answer this question but I do have an opinion on this matter from personal experience.

Find somebody who's background compliments yours.  For example, if you are entirely confident of your technical skills but lacking in management skills then find somebody meeting the exact opposite criteria.

It's important (in this example) that they have SOME technical skills so they can follow the direction of the company and fully understand your role.

The last thing you want is a yes-man.  Somebody too much like yourself can let your mistakes go overlooked.
