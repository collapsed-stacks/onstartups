I think that I've found the right company name, but I'm not sure about it.

I'll like to hear others opinion, and I don't know how to do it in order to protect the domanin name and to get fair/professional opinions about my choice.

You can use crowd-power to resolve this. This is fairly good method in my opinion. Not only do you get good feedback, but you also are able to promote your startup with your immediate community. More detailed explanation follows.

During your name seeking you likely invented lots of fairly good names. Create list of 10 goodish names, including your preferred name. Just list names alphabetically. Ask many of your  friends to pick top 3 best and top 3 worst names from the list. Include all kinds of people and possible even foreign language persons to your email recipient list. You could also ask them to suggest alternative names they come up.

If friends tells you certain name to be absolutely the best, give that name +3 points. If it's second best give that name +2 points. And so on. Do the same with negative points for the worst names. 

Put all this data to spreadsheet and aggregate sums for each name. You should clearly see which names are good and which are not. Now armed with this info you can pick the name for your company, or do a 2nd round with few best names from round one plus new ideas gathered from your community.
