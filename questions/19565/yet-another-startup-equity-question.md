I recently ran into an acquaintance ("Bill") who is solely involved in a startup. The product is a software (SAAS) with b2b application for a specific industry.

Bill has a technical background and has already spent a year on different ideas and the last 3-4 months specifically developing this software. All coding is outsourced to various developers and he came up with the idea and is basically holding this project together. So far Bill has a few clients & now he wants to mass market this and wants to put a team together to scale out. Ultimately his goal is to get a CEO, sell this product and move on to the next project. He is looking for a CRO, the first addition to the Team.

My background is in Sales & Marketing for 10+ years. I expressed interest in being on the team and he asked me to give him a proposal of what he wants to do.

What is the best, fair approach? He can't pay me $$ for salary in the beginning, so not sure how to go about doing this. I have an established position with existing employer with a comp package of $120k. Bill wants some kind of Revenue sharing, but is open to a proposal. 

Is it too late for a Co-Founder status? While the product and idea are set for this specific industry, I can think of many other applications using the same technology.

I want equity because there are no guarantees of retaining position in this startup once the sale is made. I won't get salary, just part of the revenues once sales are made. 

I am not trying to be greedy, but trying to understand what's a "fair share" for the scenario.

Thanks in advance for reading and your input!

Equity splits can be tricky. This idea is really not at the startup stage anymore. It's more at the expansion stage.

It still makes sense to have an equity stake and that's going to depend a lot on the value you add to the business. A fair equity stake in something like this would be something like 5-15%. Now, you may want to have an option for expansion markets and that stake should be significantly more (more like founders shares).

Whatever you decide, make sure to get it in writing.

Now would be a good time to incorporate, or re-incorporate. It sounds like, if your current employer will permit it, some kind of revenue sharing would make sense. As far as equity, you can speak with an attorney about developing a vesting schedule for your equity stake that would reflect your additions to the business. 

Ultimately, the percentages vested and unvested need to be decided by the two of you. But an attorney could help put that into practice, and could probably help you figure out a method to accomplish what you are looking to accomplish. Where are you located?
