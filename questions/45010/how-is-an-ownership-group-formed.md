I am interested in forming an "ownership group". I see the term all over the place, especially in sports, but can't seem to find any details on how these groups are initially formed. Is it a legal formation, or is it just a group of people pooling their funds together with a verbal commitment.

Thanks so much!

<p>There isn't a legal construct called an "ownership group". It is just a language short form, something journalists say when they mean 'all owners of <code>x</code>'.</p>

<p>You should go see a lawyer and a good tax advisor. Depending on what is being owned, and which percentages each owner has, some constructs can sometimes be much more tax-efficient than others.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has a nice overview of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_organizations" rel="nofollow">most common types of business organizations</a> in English law:</p>

<ul>
<li>Corporation</li>
<li>Limited company</li>
<li>Unlimited company</li>
<li>Limited liability partnership</li>
<li>Limited partnership</li>
<li>Not-for-profit corporation</li>
<li>Company limited by guarantee</li>
<li>Partnership</li>
<li>Sole Proprietorship</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds like the term <strong>investment club</strong> would get you more information.  Here is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_club#Legal_structure" rel="nofollow">wiki article</a> that discusses legal formation.</p>

<p>Of course, there's always a <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0764554093" rel="nofollow">dummy book</a> on the topic as well ;)</p>
