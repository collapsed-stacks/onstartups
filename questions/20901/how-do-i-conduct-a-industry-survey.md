I am doing some research alone and i'd like to conduct a industry wide survey. But how do i do it? Do i contact HR at every company i know of and ask if i can contact X amount of employees for research? do i talk to people i know and ask them to referrer me to someone else? Am i expected to compensate people for doing the survey?

I'd like to survey 1000 teams or more. I only know about 6 teams and many people i know are on the same team as someone else.

The survey is a software tool and the professionals i seek are programmers in visual media.

Have you tried linkedin answers to ask some of the more basic questions in your survey and then use that to push traffic to your survey. 

Is there an industry association or a larger platform in your market that you can reach out to distribute the survey to their membership.
