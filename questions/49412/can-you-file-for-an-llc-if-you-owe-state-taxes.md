I currently owe the state $200 in taxes but am planning to file for an LLC. Will the LLC still be approved? Or will they take the money and apply it to my past due taxes? Thanks much for the help.

Yes, it's not a problem.  The Secretary of State, where you file your certificate of formation for the LLC, is separate from the tax department.  

You should pay those taxes though since complications for your LLC could arise from the non-payment.  For example, if you ever merge the LLC or want to dissolve it, that could be held up due to the outstanding taxes.
