**Background**:  
I've these thoughts about quitting the computer industry altogether and starting a "normal" business either a coffee shop, or a [sushi bar][1].  

I would like to make my own "real" coffee creations, like, buy whole beans, roast them on my own and brew them to really good coffee :)  

**Question**:  

What would I need for a small (average starbucks-shop size) coffee shop in terms of equipment?  

I hope we can gather some tips together :)  


Thank you

I'd think long and hard about the hours involved in starting a coffee shop. I had a friend who did it in Cali and she was sleeping about 4 hours a night. People want coffee when they wake up. That means you have to be ready to go at 6 a.m. or so... I just bring that up because I think a lot of programmers are nightowls who really value flexible hours, but I'm sure that's a gross stereotype.
