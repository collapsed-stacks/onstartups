I have developed a brand  new product that meets all the financial (cost / price / marketetr size, etc.) hurdles, as well as the operational constraints (size, weight, strength, portability, adjustability, safety, etc.) for a very specific need within a specific industry.  

There is absolutly NO competition as this industry is not one where people normally focus their attention or dollars. Essentially, I have taken an existing product and have tailored it to meet this particular need... all focus groups have proved quite successful / excited about this product. 

My problem is that I do not have the connections, resources to meet with those folks who would / might be interested in taking this product to market. It is a very financially attractive project - $80 million in a full mature year, with excellent EBIT. Anyone I have attempted to contact would not sign NDA - will not disclose  product with this kind of ROR without one.  Have been told by distributors (in the particular industry)that would make a perfect partner, they are extremely  interested (since it passed their intitial 20 operational / financial  questions to determine if it would spend any additional  time on this) but they said "trust us"... Need  help with this, this has  legs. I  am in the Philadephia area.

What would you define as "right" folks? 

Is it investors, customers, distributors?  

All very difficult to determine without additional information. 

Many times, if we are talking about seed capital for your product, you need to get letters of intent from major customers that will commit to purchasing your product when it is available on the market.  Then, with LOI's in hand, meet with investors (or banks) to secure funds.  

As Ryan said, many investors will not sign NDA's.  They are in the business of investing in ideas - not stealing and building ideas they happen to hear about.  There is a significant gap between a presentation and launching an business - if you are working with reputable firms, they don't have the time/resources to ruin their reputation by attempting to steal ideas.
