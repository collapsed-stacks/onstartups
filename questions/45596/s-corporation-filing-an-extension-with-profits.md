So,  you have a S-Corporation with profits,  there's an ownership dispute with a court date in May, after the filing date of March 15th.   

Should the S-Corporation file an extension?   So normally,  when you file an S-Corp tax form,  the K-1 passes the income to the shareholders,  but in this case,  does the tax (on the profits) not become due until the S-corp files the return (after the 6 month extension)???

Of course not. Make sure your personal estimates are paid on time based on what you **expect** to see in your K-1, assuming the court decides the worst possible way for you (tax-wise, i.e.: assuming the K-1 shows the most taxable income of all possibilities). File an extension for yourself till October so that you wouldn't be subject to late filing penalty, and calculate everything during the summer when all the numbers are known.

If the court decides in your favor, you'll get a refund, if the court decides against you you'll be covered as your estimates were based on this scenario anyway.

The tax is due when the money is earned, not when you get some piece of paper, and the money has been earned already.

This is not a tax advice, and should not be relied upon to avoid any taxes or penalties. Talk to a professional tax adviser (EA/CPA) for a tax advice.
