I incorporated as a c corp in NV but reside in SC where I have the business address.  I am a mobile internet consultant and my clients are not located in SC.  I need health insurance for myself and I am told by a major health insurance company that I have to get a SC certificate of authority.  Is this true?

<p>well it really depends on where you operate.<br>
If you are just Domiciled in Nevada, and operate in SC, then you need to register as a foreign corp in SC. If you operate in Nevada then you need to contact a Nevada provider for Health Insurance. Health Insurance providers are licensed by state, so a branch of say Aetna operating in SC can't insure a Nevada company, unless you go through Corporate programs, which for a single employee you wouldn't qualify</p>
