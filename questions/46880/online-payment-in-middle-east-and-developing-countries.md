I'm establishing a crowdfunding website for Start Ups. So far I figured out the only way to replace online payment would be through mobiles. I'm currently establishing this in Iraq (**paypal** is not available here), and I looked at a few examples of mobile payment from Nigeria and other countries, but I didn't really understand how it works.

It would be great if someone advised me to use another way of payment, or explain how the mobile payment works.

<p>Besides that is not available in your country, Paypal and other similar services like Square, there are already other services as <a href="https://www.flint.com/how-it-works/" rel="nofollow">Flint</a> providing a system to accept cards directly with phone's camera without requiring the dongle, which connected to the mobile reads the magnetic stripe on the card.</p>

<p>Another option is <a href="http://bitcoin.org/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin</a>, which is also available for mobiles on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet" rel="nofollow">Android</a>. For any doubts there is a community of Bitcoin on <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/">stackexchange</a>.</p>
