I want to make a website, that is by definition a software, but I don't remind seeing any open source websites. My website like many is supposed to pay itself by ads.

Is there a reason why I should not open the source code of my whole website instead of just specific components? And the benefits are the same of making other kind of software open source?

I am not sure if it will be for profit or not, so in the case the answers for both are different, you would be interesting to point it out.

EDIT: I tried to clarify the question above. I don't have any doubt on how great is to get something awesome you made for you website, strip any dependencies to your website and make publicly available. I wonder whether every company or NPO keep the code of the website itself for them (and that is what I meant by *not in a public repository*) and why?

This depends from several other things:

 1. Do you think that the code you will make public will provide benefits to someone else(i.e. will someone else use it)?
 2. Does your website software contain something new or special?
 3. Do you expect people to build around it i.e. to extend it, fix errors etc?

Update:

How you can benefit from an open source site?

If you are using a design that you are willing to share as a template or the application bellow your website contains useful functionalities and after a good buzz around it then people may decide to use it, extend it with additional modules/widgets/cross-browser fixes/etc.
Have in mind that none of the famous web projects has become famous in one night. You are the one who have to pull the project forward to make it popular and to gain contributors.

If you want to give people access to your data and resources, then you should make a web service api that they can call; you site would then be a software as a service site.  If you have some type of software that others can install as a website or as an add-on to their website and you want everyone to have the code, possibly contributing to it and improving it, then make it open source.
