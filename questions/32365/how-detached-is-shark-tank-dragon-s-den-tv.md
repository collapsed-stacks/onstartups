There is a chance we will be entering our first round of VC meetings soon, and I am mildly addicted to the show Shark Tank and its predecessor Dragon's Den (UK).

There is a [similar thread][1] on this topic, but I am trying to calibrate my head for negotiations during my "off time", and I'm wondering if anyone that has gone through the rigors of funding has any specific feedback about what rings true about the show and what is just TV fluff.
