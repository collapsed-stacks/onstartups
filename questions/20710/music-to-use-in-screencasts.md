We are regularly making some screencasts to demonstrate new functionality to our clients.

It would be good to have some nice, engaging background music playing throughout the show.

Are there any free tracks we can use legally?

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/%22SoundCloud%22" rel="nofollow">SoundCloud</a> which is sort of like flickr for sounds and look at creative commons licensed tracks. You can also use the site to connect with artists and negotiate terms of use.</p>

If you don't mind paying few bucks for the artists that produce the music you use, check http://www.shockwave-sound.com/ which is my favorite source for high quality music.

AudioJungle.net - Best place to find this type of stuff, plus you can contact composers.  The creators of the site also have VideoHive.com, which is a very powerful site for After Effects templates, which are great for presentations. 

Good Luck.

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/" rel="nofollow">ccmixter</a>, It's Creative Commons music.</p>

<p>When selecting your track, pay attention to the license though. Some tracks are CC-BY-NC (non commercial), others can be used also in a commercial context. </p>

<p>I suggest you look at <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/licensing" rel="nofollow">Magnatune</a>. I've never licensed music from them, but I do like their ethical business model (paying artists fairly for their work). You can stream music for free from them, to see if it would work in a particular project. (Edit: I don't believe this music is free, but I don't think it is expensive either).</p>

SoundClick has paid and free songs of high quality, just be sure to read the artist's description of what you can do with the music. However, there are frequently artists who give away music, or simply ask for attribution, which you can do at the end of the presentation/screencast.

<p><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/" rel="nofollow">Jamendo</a> has a huge collection of creative commons licensed music. You can download &amp;/ listen to these songs for free. Do check the license before using any track in your presentation. There's a Royalty-free music section too. </p>
