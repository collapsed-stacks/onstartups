 1. Because I see it as a logical next step in my career. Starting from developer, through team leader and software architect to project manager, now I want to see if I can handle the whole set of responsibilities to run the company. From this perspective, it's a great learning experience and challenge.

 2. To put my ideas into work and see if and how much I really understand this business. It's one thing to guess what would be if you are in charge, and completely different thing to act like one.

 3. For several years I kept losing motivation to work for people who didn't get it, still they are the ones who make the final decisions. Especially in my case, here in Bulgaria the management as a profession is still in its baby years.

 4. To secure the financial future for my family, and to empower myself to work on projects that I love and really care for.

<p>I wrote about this in a <a href="http://cornerstonetechnology.com/blog/2010/01/management-a-necessary-evil/" rel="nofollow">recent post</a>, trying to answer the question "why don't I just get a regular job?", as I recently left the firm that acquired my last business.</p>

<p>For me, I believe it makes more sense trying to grow significant value outside of the conventional employment market, whilst offering a certain amount of flexibility.  You can get a perspective on why staying in 'normal' employment isn't such a great idea from <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/07/10-reasons-you-should-never-get-a-job/" rel="nofollow">this article by Steve Pavlina</a> (NB I don't agree with everything he writes, but at least it makes you think).</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

Theres something infinitely more promising about creating value then adding to existing value. To me its the economic concept of marginal utility - the more you have of something, the less you value each additional unit of it. Likewise with regular jobs. The more people that do the same thing, the less value that job adds. But, if you create NEW jobs, the value of each new job is infinite.

Then theres also the extremely exciting road through a startup. And the startup community.

The startup community has been so unbelievably inviting and willing to help that I'd feel ashamed of myself if i didn't give something back...
