Here's the scenario:

 1. There is a product with a high learning curve while it's still in beta, but this will be alleviated in the release version. 

 2. The product is at a point where it is no longer necessary to be kept stealth, but it never hurts to have it more fine-tuned before the whole world sees it. The company can be a first mover into a niche market, but not positive for how long. 

What are the benefits/pitfalls of having a private beta, vs. making a publicly available download-able beta via the website. 

**Some pros I can think of for a public beta are:**

 - Increased exposure to potential customers
 - Increased exposure to potential partners
 - Establishing a market presence early on
 - Find out what features customers really want out of the product  

**Cons:**

 - Someone can take the idea if it is pre-maturely exposed to the market
 - If it is a large success, the company can potentially be over-burdened by support calls (due to the learning curve to implement the beta) and development may cease. (Although there could be worse problems to have)

**Some pros I can think of for a private beta are:**

 - Testers have more of a "vested" interest in creating products success
 - Not susceptible to theft
 - Nothing that the company can't handle (support-wise)

**Cons:**

 - Perhaps no longer first mover to market (another company claims dominant presence) 
 - Not enough awareness generated and when release comes, no one knows what it is or if they can trust it. 
 - Testers know too much about product and may not reflect realistic target market (provides inaccurate feedback about product)  

Thanks in advance!

Having the support lines ringing off the hook because so many people are working with your beta would be a wonderful problem to have! :)

If you're concerned that someone will hijack your idea because you're releasing a beta well in advance of your anticipated general release, you could address this by requiring a non-disclosure agreement to be executed with your beta sites. If it's a good idea someone with more money and more developers than you will start hijacking it the minute it's available so this is fairly thin protection unless your beta period is extraordinarily long. 

One word of caution - if there is anything in your product that you anticipate that you might patent, make sure to talk with your attorney before you disclose anything to anyone outside your company without a properly drafted and properly executed non-disclosure agreement. Making something generally available to the public impacts your ability to file a patent (US patent law limits the time window for patentability for things published or made available in commerce).

<p>We've run a quite successful private beta about 6 months ago for 2-3 months. </p>

<p>Don't do public beta unless your product is pretty stable and works as expected in many stages otherwise lots of people will ignore you for the next year based on the crap beta experience. That's hard to shake off.</p>

<p>Depending on your product when you go public you'll notice you've got 1000 more bugs than you know.</p>

<p>If you decide to do private beta, <strong>read</strong> and follow <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BetaTest.html" rel="nofollow">Joel's advice</a>. I wish I had.</p>

<p>Finally, you can do a quick private beta and depending on the product stability etc. you can open the beta later on.</p>
