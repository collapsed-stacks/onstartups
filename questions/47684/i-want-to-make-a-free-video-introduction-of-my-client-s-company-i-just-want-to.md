I want to make a free video introduction of my client's company. I just want to use images, text and little bit of effects and sound.


Is there any free web based or anything, by which I can make it?

<p>There are several tools for editing video online. The results -however- may vary and depending of how complex is the online tool you may need to even pay to get your video downloaded.</p>

<p>I suggest you to run a search on google for "video editor" (with no quotation marks) in order to receive lots of online tools in a comprehensive list.</p>

<p>In example: <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/video-editing-30-free-tools-and-web-services-to-get-things-done/" rel="nofollow">This list</a> includes 30 popular video editing online software which includes some self hosted applications to be installed in your own server like "Movie Masher", which is represented in the next screenshot.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you wish pro-like results, you may need to use software like Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere, and other tools for windows. Openshot and KDEnlive are available for linux. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>You could try using <a href="http://stupeflix.com" rel="nofollow">Stupeflix</a>, an professional online video making tool. It even gives you a free test video. It's incredibly easy to use, and you can add text-to-speech on top of your photos / videos.</p>
