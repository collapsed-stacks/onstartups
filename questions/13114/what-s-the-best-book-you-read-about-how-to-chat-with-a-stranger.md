I think that talking to people is topic or objective orientated.  So there are books on meetings and setting agendas, books on public speaking and books on influence.  So lots of different sub topics within communicaiton.  So I'll just highlight one of my favorite books which is on influence.  
<li>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion <br>
http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X/
I'm not sure why you got a neg on this but it would be nice if someone is going to neg a question to provide feedback in the comments as to why.

<p>This may be a bad assumption, but your phrasing of the question has me thinking of you as maybe a little more introverted than you think one is allowed to be to lead a business successfully. I was a bit similar, and then one of my previous startup's founders recommended one of the most influential books I think I read, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People" rel="nofollow">How To Win Friends and Influence People</a></p>

<p>While not the total attitude changer most newer books claim to be and since some of that effort still had to come from myself and continuous feedback from peers, it did give me a direction in which to take my first steps to being more outgoing, of understanding what drives people and how to make my voice heard while not being overbearing. This in turn allowed me better success rates whether it was pitching my ideas to co-workers, or selling my wares to prospective clients.
If you find the Wikipedia link above interesting enough, you can <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0671723650" rel="nofollow">pick up a copy on Amazon.com</a></p>

I can strongly recommend **Never Eat Alone** by Keith Ferrazi - changed the way I thought about such things: http://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512066/.
