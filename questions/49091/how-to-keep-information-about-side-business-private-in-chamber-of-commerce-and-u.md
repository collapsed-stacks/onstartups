I am looking to incorporate a startup online business as a side business in california. I want to keep the information about my involvement private until I'm somewhat confident about the enterprise. After that I can go public. 

Would some information-digging website (such as corporationwiki) be able to dig officer information etc and post it online? How do these sites obtain this information?

It's been suggested that creating an LLC in Wyoming or Nevada can keep it private.
But the company would still need to register as a "foreign entity" in CA, which would make its officer/director information public. So, llc in nevada/wyoming would not work.

There's no way to avoid it in California. LLC members/Corporate officers is a public record.
