<p>Myself and a couple of associates are starting up a job advertisement and CV database site. As part of the functionality of our site will be that employers based in various countries, can look through and download user submitted CVs and profiles, we want to make sure our sites terms and conditions are bulletproof. </p>

<p>We talked to a solicitor but they gave us a rather large quote (around Â£4000), and although are requirements are somewhat bespoke, I feel that we probably shouldn't have to shell out such a large sum. There are already sites providing similar services and our terms aren't likely to be much different from theirs.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is, what can we do to make sure our legal documents are strong yet won't cost a fortune? How can we bypass the fees?</p>

<p>"Analyze" your competitors legal agreements, draft a document and then let a solicitor review it which would be done at a much cheaper price.</p>

<p>Don't copy paste their agreements. Try to go through each clause and see why was that added and if it can be added on your site.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>can look through and download user submitted CVs and profiles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can employers directly see personal details of each submitted CV? If so, you need to mention that.</p>

<p>what can we do to make sure our legal documents are strong yet won't cost a fortune?</p>

<p>The world doesn't work this way, professionals tend to change fair money for their work, good legal advice is expensive.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use "weak" legal documents (by doing them yourself or using a cheap lawyer) for now and if/when the service becomes a success you'll have the money to do it right (just remember to leave in a clause that let you change the terms of use later) </p></li>
<li><p>Pay the money</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I would go for the first option unless it's a project that is highly likely to get me sued.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, getting legal advice from a stranger on the internet is stupid, etc.</p>
