I am afraid the only way to monetize Facebook application is to place ads on that page. The way Facebook is setup is when you add an application FB staff needs to review and approve it. When a user wants to add your app, Facebook asks them if they want to give permission to the app to access your page. If they grant permission, they basically add a page that can access certain parts of their profile information. Developers of FB apps count on heavy volume of users to generate ad revenue. Adding adds is also not simple. Some use iFrames to include them because the page is technically hosted on your own website but appears as an include on FB.

Now, if you are developing an iPhone app, then it is a stand-alone program that can be sold as an item, thus generating revenue other than advertising.

<p>There are Facebook apps that require payment. One example is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/twittertab" rel="nofollow">Twitter Tab</a>. Twitter Tab has both a free version and a paid version. The paid version allows the user to customize the background. </p>

<p>However, in my experience, very few people are willing to pay to use Facebook apps. I think it's because people are used to being able to use them for free. For example, I believe the paid version of Twitter Tab is only $1/year, but I've seen people complain about it.</p>

The best way, in my opinion, is to have CPA ads that are manually targeted to your demographic.  CPA ads can bring in anywhere from $0.50-$20 per response, so they are definitely worth looking at.

You can charge for it. Facebook will always let anyone install the app, but you can charge to activate it. If a customer hasn't yet paid, the app the installed will be dormant. Since the app is run off of your own server you can control the payment methods to a certain extent.

The model we use is the so-called freemium model.

The game is free to play, but there are extra options available for premium (paying) players.

We charged $4 per month (with longer term options as well), and had about a 5% conversion rate.  This is low, I think, and we could easily have done better.  But we ran out of cash :(

There is a market out there.

Focus on your content (value) and always have your monetisation model in place (another mistake we made, we failed to cash in on the first rush).

You CAN generate revenue from Facebook apps without advertising. Facebook recently released Facebook credits which lowers the barriers to monitization. Games have been successfully converting sales for coins/advancements/etc in a game, why not apply the same principles to a business app.

Even if you didn't want to use FB credits there's nothing to stop you from having your own in-process credit card payment screens. Besides, you could develop the app as a FB Connect app and host it on its own domain as an external app, and have more control over its presentation.
