I'm from the UK and I'm looking for a way to credit check customers on the fly when they enter their relevant information into our forms.

When they hit submit, I'm assuming we'll call some form of data feed which can see if this persons credit score, is either acceptable or unacceptable.  Our website will then either approve or decline them.

Does anyone know who offers this service in the UK?

Cheers,

Jonah

Experian, Equifax and Callcredit are the main providers in the UK, although you'll have to check with them to see if they can allow you API access, as you describe.
