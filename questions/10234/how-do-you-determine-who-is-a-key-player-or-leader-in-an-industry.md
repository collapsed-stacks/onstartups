Say for example, i want to do a search on Accountants in London(UK), and i want to determine which accountant is the most prominent one. i.e. that has actual influence on the industry.

How would *you* go about doing this? Is there a key metric i should be searching for?
Please bear in mind, whatever formula you come up with, i must be able to do it for free, without having to subscribe to any kind of "companies database" etc.

Thank you kindly

I don't believe there's a formula for that. "Leader" is often a subjective concept. Get on a phone and call randomly a few accounting firms and ask their opinion. If you get the same name a few times -- that's your answer.
