I work at an Oil & Gas Company in Texas and we use many 1099 contractors to get jobs done (welding, casing, and other services. I have started a side Bookkeeping/Accounting Business with very few clients. Would it be wrong to reach out to some of the contractors that my Main Company uses to provide services to them?

It really depends on the contract you signed when you started working there, and what kind of relationship you have with the company you work for and the independent contractors. 

Many companies make you sign a contract when you're hired that won't allow you to work with their business connections for up to a designated period of time after you leave the company. Generally those kinds of contracts are just precautionary, but you should still double check to be sure. Since it's not competing with the company you work for, that gives you an advantage. I think the only way to be safe would be to talk with your manager and make sure that the company has no issues with it. Also, make sure you have a pretty good relationship with any contractors you approach as they may find it weird that you're trying to sell them your accounting/book keeping services.
