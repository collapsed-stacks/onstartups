<p>Our three founders will not really be the true founders. We realize we need to give power and control to the next team members who will become the true founders, while we will be demoted to consultants. One of us invented the intellectual property and the other two contributed legal fees to lock down everything in this health IT area. The initial three have a 75%, 12.5%, 12.5% split as we form the Delaware C Corp. We will create 10,000,000 shares at a par value of .0001 dollar = $1,000. Inventor is disabled and cannot work or travel. Other two are at the top of their careers in great jobs and cannot leave, but can consult. Knowing that we will be turning this over to one or more of the next team members (such as the CTO, CEO, or CMO), how should we distribute the equity? Should the three temporary founders issue 10 million shares and only split up and assign 1 million shares? Or should we go the other way and issue 10 million shares and split up and assign 9 million of them? What we are trying to do is monetize what we believe is very important and valuable intellectual property we want right now for our own use by forming a C Corp and turning over equity, power, and control as needed to get it off the ground. I could also assign all equity to the inventor and give convertible notes to the other two. How do you do start-up equity when you know from the get go you will need to give up a lot to future team members?   </p>

<p>None of your current calculations matter. Your only goal is to find an entrepreneur CEO who will take over your business. That person must have the motivation to do all the hard work none of you are willing to put in.</p>

<p>How much that entrepreneur CEO will cost you is purely a negotiation. The entrepreneur will tell you what they want.</p>

<p>Finding the right person is 99% of the problem.</p>
