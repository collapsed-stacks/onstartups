I have an Internet-based business that I will launch hopefully in the first half of this year.  I am the only employee and I don't anticipate growing for the foreseeable future.  However, to protect myself I thought it would be wise to establish my business formally as an LLC.

Right now, I'm living in Asia, and I will probably be here for several more years.  I'm originally from Indiana, but I haven't been in the state in the past five years.  Most of the advice I have read suggests registering in your home state, but since I no longer live there nor do I plan to move back there, I wonder whether I may be an exception.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

My personal suggestion would be delaware, There are a few reason why Delaware, Delaware has the Court of Chancery instead of juries. They will also accept amendments through faxes. There are a few other states you may look at but Delaware is my favorite
