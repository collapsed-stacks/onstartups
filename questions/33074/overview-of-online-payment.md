I know Stack Exchange is meant to answer precise questions instead of discussing a subject, so would like to know where to find a good forum to discuss issues related to online payments (eg. how to receive payments on the web from shareware customers or friends I helped).

The first page returned by Google for "[online payment forum][1]" didn't return much:

 - www.ukbusinessforums.co.uk: I'm not located in the UK, and the questions I have are not UK-specific
 - www.getpaidforum.com: "The board administrator is no longer accepting any new registrations at the moment."
 - www.ebgenius.com : Lots of "0 replies" threads
 - www.webpayments.ie : very few topics + logon dialog "The server... requires a username and password"
 - www.v7n.com/forums/online-payment-processing/: very low traffic

Does someone know of a good place (ie. lot of, good-quality threads) to ask?

Thank you.

Try [The Business of Software](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz) it is a community discussing the business of software, from the smallest shareware operation to Microsoft.
