I am just about to incorporate a company in the UK as I am about to go through a thirteen week accelerator programme.

In order to incorporate I am required to provide a registered office address, would you recommend providing the location of the thirteen week programme as the registered office, or using someone's personal address?

Either would be a temporary solution as after the thirteen weeks we would be looking for an office.  Is it straightforward to change the registered office address?

Thanks!

Assuming you currently live in the UK, it is best to use your home address as the Registered Address. It is trivial to change later, via a form from Companies House (online).

Many company formation agents try to up-sell a "prestigious" Registered Address, but this is not necessary and just a way for them to increase their revenue.
