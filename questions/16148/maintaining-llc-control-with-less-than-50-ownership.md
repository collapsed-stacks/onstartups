Hopefully someone can gimme a hand.  This is actually a question for a school project, but I've got some ideas kicking in my head for a startup, so I have good cause to know this for personal benefit too!
***
I'm creating a fictional LLC agreement for my business law course: my "investors" require a 51% share of the LLC.  Part of the assignment requires that I "...come up a mechanism to maintain control even when my interest is less than 50%."

I've done some googling and turned up nothing.  Maybe I'm looking at the wrong keywords.  

Help is appreciated!

<p>One of the great things about an LLC is that an Operating Agreement can allocate economic interests differently than it allocates voting rights.</p>

<p>Please see "<a href="http://dana.sh/c0iMJM" rel="nofollow">Can an LLC have Members with a Non-ownership Economic Interest?</a>", which describes a real-life client situation where we created an LLC with five classes of ownership interests.</p>

Google "passive investor". A passive investor is someone who invests money in a business (and expects a monetary return for his investment), but is not involved in the day to day management decisions of a business. Basically, they give you money in exchange for equity, without meddling in business decisions.

The Ford family owns about 2% of the total shares yet maintains control over the Ford motor company.  Just a matter of having different share classes.

You probably want 2 different components. One is to create different classes of shares. Each class can have different rights and distribution priority. Second, and more importantly, make the LLC manager-managed. Give the manager broad control over the operation of the company. Make sure that the "investor class" of member shares can't pool up and vote out you as manager.
