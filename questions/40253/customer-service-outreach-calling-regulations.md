Are there any laws or regulations in the United States that define what is or is not acceptable when doing customer service outreach calls. More specifically, what I mean by outreach is an unsolicited call to a customer regarding account activity (e.g. credit card expired).

<p>If the reason for the call is legitimate <strong>credit card expired</strong> you should be able to make additional offers during that contact. You have an existing business relationship, otherwise you wouldn't have their credit card number</p>

<p>Here is information regarding the <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/faq/faqbusiness.aspx#who" rel="nofollow">National Do Not Call Registry</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A telemarketer or seller may call a consumer with whom it has an established business relationship for up to 18 months after the consumer's last purchase, delivery, or payment - even if the consumer's number is on the National Do Not Call Registry. In addition, a company may call a consumer for up to three months after the consumer makes an inquiry or submits an application to the company. And if a consumer has given a company written permission, the company may call even if the consumer's number is on the National Do Not Call Registry.</p>
  
  <p>One caveat: if a consumer asks a company not to call, the company may not call, even if there is an established business relationship. Indeed, a company may not call a consumer - regardless of whether the consumer's number is on the registry - if the consumer has asked to be put on the company's own do not call list. </p>
