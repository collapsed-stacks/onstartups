I just started a new web design & SEO company in India.

For now we are targeting US, UK clients only.. so no personal meeting only email marketing stuff.

Most often I feel very alone and some time depressed is this because I stay along all days and don't meet anyone?

My regular schedule is like: Wakeup, Reach office, Work, Come back, Work, Sleep, Wakeup....

I feel unmotivated now.... Shall I start marketing in India too?

Thanks,
KA

Working by yourself is really hard - especially if you are the kind of person who gets their energy from being with people. As you have found, the biggest challenge is to keep yourself motivated and up. 

It's really important to deliberately and regularly plan some balance into your life if you are going to stick with your startup for the long haul. You need to do stuff you enjoy that is with people to give yourself the energy to keep plugging away by yourself.

If there is no reason not to have clients in India - go for it.

Intentionally do the stuff that keeps you sane and healthy. Exercise. Eat healthy. Plan lunches with friends once or twice a week, or go out in the evening. Keep up your relationships because those people will be there to support you when you need it.

Also, does this business suit your personality, lifestyle aspirations and goals? If you can't see it changing so you will enjoy working in it, maybe you should be looking for another business model or a completely different idea.

Are there any places in your area where other independent workers congregate like an internet cafe or tea house in your area? You may want to take some time and work there. 

You have to find something different to do. I know you want to work on your business but you can't keep this up forever. Start to budget some time for friends, family and fun. 

Not sure why you excluded doing business in India in the first place. Unless you feel that this is too much of a distraction for more suitable clients in the US/UK (you never mentioned why you chose this market), you should work with some local businesses.

You stated '...we are targetting' so I assume there are other people where you work. Are they having the same experience?

An important step to treating workplace depression is to realize that work is impermanent. Stress is impermanent. Deadlines are impermanent. Once you understand that these things will not last forever you will feel less stressed and depressed about the future. Make some plans for the evening and that way you will always have something to look forward to. The next time you feel depressed at work take a deep breath and say to yourself: “This feeling will not last forever and I am gonna watch a movie when I get home today…” and then get on with your work.

Consider organizing/joining a meetup of designers/SEO folks in your city It might take a while to get folks on it but once it gets going it will give you a social outlet in addition to giving you a chance to meet your future employees/colleagues/partners/mentors.

Yes you can as you can't go on like this for long. Do you take lunch breaks or not? Try to go nearby market during breaks or early morning, if you're working the night shift)

Working on your own takes certain type of personality. Sounds like you actually need people to interact. It probably does not need to be related to your work. Look at your typical day and see where you can make some changes to you schedule and find time to meet with friends, go for a walk or something along these line. Depression is a medical condition and can get worse if ignored. Get out, meed people, join a cause...
