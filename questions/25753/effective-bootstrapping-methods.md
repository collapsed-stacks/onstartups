This may be slightly different based on your industry, but I'm interested in your expertise on what your proven and effective methods for bootstrapping... where to save money, what steps to skip, scrappy solutions to general common problems, minimizing on website and app dev costs, etc.

<p>That's my list of tips and tricks; all tools are free, and of great value:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I moved all my web applications (especially the marketing web apps, landing pages, contact forms, ...) to the <a href="http://heroku.com" rel="nofollow">Heroku</a> free plan; your application must be written in Ruby, but for a simple static website the Ruby part will be minimal. I moved to Heroku all my blogs, webpages, and saved the money I was spending on virtual private servers</p></li>
<li><p>Use Google Apps for email, calendar, ... free and you have emails with your domain</p></li>
<li><p>I usually use Github for source control, but it's not free for private repository. If you need private repositories for free, you can use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" rel="nofollow">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="http://www.gitenterprise.com/" rel="nofollow">GitEnterprise</a></p></li>
<li><p>I don't even try to spend time to make a web design. I buy a 12-15$ design at <a href="http://themeforest.net/" rel="nofollow">Themeforest</a></p></li>
<li><p>I use <a href="http://mailchimp.com" rel="nofollow">Mailchimp</a> (free plan) for email marketing</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I know the founders of GitEnterprise and I wrote some of the code behind it a year ago.</p>
