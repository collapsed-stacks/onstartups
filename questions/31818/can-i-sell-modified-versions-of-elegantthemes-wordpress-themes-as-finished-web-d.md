Can I sell modified versions of ElegantThemes Wordpress themes as finished web design project for hire?

The [terms and conditions at ElegantThemes][1] say:

> All of our theme packages are released under the GNU Public License
> version 2.0.
> 
> All .PSD files are packaged separately and are not licesned under the
> GPL 2.0. Instead, these files inherit the Elegant Themes Personal Use
> License. These files are given to all members on a personal use basis.
> You may not offer them, modified or unmodified, for redistribution or
> resale of any kind.


The following page says it is ok:

[http://www.websitetemplatereviews.com/ephoto-wordpress-theme-review-an-elegantthemes-wp-theme][2]

> You cannot sell the theme itself, but can sell a modified version
> along with a domain name as finished web design project for hire.

but I am confused.

<p>This is a few years old, but I think it's a good place start. (I don't have a membership so I cannot go to the members area to verify this is still correct):</p>

<p>"The price is a one time fee of $89, and gives you permission to use the themes for all of your client web design projects."</p>
