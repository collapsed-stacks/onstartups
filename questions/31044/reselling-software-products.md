I have a fairly new startup in the UK and have identified a need to resell certain commercial software products to my customers as part of bespoke solutions.  Does anybody know if there's anything special I need to do with the companies whose software I wish to sell?

Can I just buy the software somewhere and sell it on with a markup, or does it depend on the software/company?  One of the companies whose software I would like to resell is Symantec, if that helps in any way.

It depends on the company but when you buy the software from the company the license is often attributed to you where in fact you actually want the license to reside with the person who buys from you. There are normally a few hoops to jump through to become a reseller such as providing web site and company details but is often worth it for the benefits they provide you such as the discounts, online training and marketing materials.

Most large software companies have reseller programs for example Symantec's is documented here:
