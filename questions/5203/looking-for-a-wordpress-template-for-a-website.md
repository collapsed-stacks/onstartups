I am looking for a WordPress template to use specifically for purposes of building a website for a consulting firm. Not a blog. Most of the templates I find are designed for blogs. Do you guys know of a source that has website templates.

I would suggest looking up the WordPress [Themes directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/commercial/).  One commercial template site that I use and like is [Templatic](http://templatic.com).  

If you are looking for free themes, then one site that you can look at is [WooThemes](http://www.woothemes.com).

<p>If you don't mind getting your hands dirty, <a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic/" rel="nofollow">Thematic</a> is the way to go if you want a well laid out customization route.  You can do pretty much anything you need with Thematic, and the layout is completely controlled by the child theme.</p>

<p><a href="http://diythemes.com/thesis/" rel="nofollow">Thesis</a> is a great commercial theme aimed not only at blogs.  You can check out the <a href="http://diythemes.com/thesis/showcase/" rel="nofollow">Showcase</a> to see what sites are using the Thesis theme.</p>

1. Themeforest.
2. Some hosting providers give you access to big template sites. Whether they offer WP themes, you'll have to check, but even if they don't it wouldn't cost too much to have someone convert a generic theme into a WP one. Alternatively, search any type of website template site and have someone convert it.
3. Articles like this one on design websites/blogs (http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/08/100-excellent-free-high-quality-wordpress-themes/) give you a lot of screenshots and usually some ideas for non-malware-ridden sites where you can get some quality designs.

The best advice is to go "premium" and have someone either convert a design you like, if it's not a WP design, or purchase one from one of the good vendors out there like Themeforest. There are so many people using the popular freebies that at this point it might detract a little from your site if you use it too. And frankly, the for-pay ones often look a little more professional than a lot of the freebies. Spend the money, get better results.
