I am looking for a co-founder now for a project that would love to get up and running.  As an initial formality are there any documents out there that can outline in basic terms what each person is responsible for and their percentage of the business? I will start a fully registered company but honestly at the moment do not have the funds to incorporate and pay for all that work that would need to get done.  It is something however that I would do before launching.

I just want to protect our initial relationship so that we are all aware of our requirements.

Any Ideas or suggestions are openly welcome.

PS I would be based out of Canada

<p>I would say what you need is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership%5Fagreement" rel="nofollow">partnership agreement</a>.</p>

Bob - have a look at FairSoftware.net - you could start there and then graduate to your own business entity when the time is right.

This is actually an important document that you want to prepare. If you want, I will give you a free consult and put together the document that you need for free. 

Just think of me later when you get things going. 

If you are interested, please send an email with your contact details and best times to call to drewsharon911@yahoo.com.
