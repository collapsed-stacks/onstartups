<p>I am trying to understand the relationship between the Sales funnel (Leads become prospects become customers) and the purchase funnel (awareness to interest to evaluation to purchase). Are they different perspectives of the same process? Are they the same thing just using different vocabulary (personally I don't see how you can derive one from the other)? Is one the sequence of nouns, and the other the sequence of verbs?</p>

<p>Wikipedia seems to treat them as one concept but I swear a year ago when I was first researching this there were 2 separate pages:</p>
