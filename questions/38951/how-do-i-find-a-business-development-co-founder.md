I've been working on my mobile security startup since last 6+ months and the product is getting close to demo phase. I've registered the corporation..etc. Right now i'm planning to raise funds so preparing pitching deck. it appears that without co-founder it will be really hard to raise money. I'm coming from engineering/tech background and i am looking for business development/marketing person as co-founder. how do you find co-founder? I've been attending start-up meet-ups and talked to lot of people but i couldn't find the right person.

Think of the weaknesses you have, and research to find where such animals congregate.  Hate to say it (since it will not come off nice) but finding a co-founder isn't a matter of a drive by meeting at the local meet-up.  

There are a bunch of good posts in onstartups - and here is an older TC article that may help.
