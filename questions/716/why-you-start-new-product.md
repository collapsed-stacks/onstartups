Since this is tagged with _motivation_, I don't think that _money_ (on their own), is quite enough to carry yourself through building a new (good) product. The projects that I'm really interested in are the ones that I do **for myself** -- something that my friends and I will use regularly and enjoy. I figure that if the result is good enough, some money will come as a side-effect.
