Due to various reasons (career related, privacy etc) I would like to hide the fact that I am the owner of the LLC from the general public and from anyone else trying  to figure out the owners of the company. Hiding the above from the Govt/IRS is not needed.

Is there a legal way to to accomplish the above?

Delaware doesn't require reporting membership information from LLC's registered in Delaware. However, if you're having business in other states, you'll have to register your DE LLC there as well, so it will only work if you live and operate your LLC in Delaware.

There may be other ways to "obscure" ownership, but that would require a lawyer to be involved (trusts etc).

<p>NPR's Planet Money recently <a href="http://n.pr/OtsCbS" rel="nofollow">did a podcast</a> and Adam Davidson wrote a <a href="http://nyti.ms/NOb1w9" rel="nofollow">NY Times article</a> on registering off-shore companies.  It's fairly inexpensive and can be completely anonymous.</p>

<p>Same goes for registering a LLC with the <a href="http://www.in.gov/sos/" rel="nofollow">Indiana Secretary of State</a> , in fact you don't even need to provide a physical location address there either and is much cheaper annually than DE. </p>

<p>In regards to doing business in your State and what was mentioned above, you can simply for the same cost as filing for a foreign LLC in your State, form another LLC there where your DE/IN LLC is the managing member.  That way your information will never become public and be seen by anyone.  It will only show membership online by your DE/IN LLC and when someone goes to the SOS website in DE/IN, it won't show your info there either.</p>

<p>Therefore your info is hidden in DE/IN and since that LLC is the only Managing Member in your States LLC the path will lead to nowhere.</p>

<p>One is the Holding Company, and the other is the Subsidiary.  Since they are LLC's you are not double taxed and do not need to file individual returns per LLC, it all falls through you in the end avoiding double taxation.</p>
