I am starting my own IT consultancy and have a good product in mind, but I also want to be the one controlling my own project.

I have a few questions

 1. Who has the rights over your software project?
 2. If you both terminate contracts, will your partner own the software?
 3. If your partner has given you an agreement to sign should you also give them an agreement to sign?
 4. If I get partner I don't want them to sell my product?
 5. I have read the partner agreement, and it's as if I am a sales guy selling their products. I
    am not sure, can you give me advice?

I am confused and still have more questions, but don't know where to start. I want to take over an established business in India that has good quality developers.

This sounds pretty confusing... perhaps you need professional advice on this?

 1. The contracts should clarify this.  It's usual for s/w to be owned by the consultancy developing it.  Exceptions could have been made for certain staff/contractors.  India may have different default rules.
 2. I'd imagine shared ownership - how it gets separated depends on how you sell on / wind up the business.
 3. Absolutely!
 4. Don't follow - your partner wouldn't be allowed to make sales?  Or you don't want your partner to be able to sell the rights to the product without your knowledge or say so? If the latter, then **is he the right partner for you**  you should be going into this with some pre-existing trust between you.
 5. Partnership agreement could be licensing you to sell their products I suppose, as opposed to a legal entity known as a partnership.  If you're expecting one and it reads like the other, then you **need to seek professional advice** on the paperwork/contracts.

Good luck

There is already a partnership agreement in place? What are the terms? If you don't like them, change them as a counter offer. That's why they print them out, so you can cross things out and make additions ;)

Contractually you can make any agreements you want (within the law of course) over who owns what, who has control of the intellectual property rights, salaries, profits, rights to sell, etc. 

Unless you can pay competitive salaries and benefits for a technical leader, they'll want to be a partner and may want some form of additional conpensation if they contribute to the company's success. It could be ownership, project control, stock options or just a big cash payout.

Have they given any indication this is there final offer?

This depends **alot** on how valuable is the technical partner in terms of skills and experience. He will be higly motivated and involved if he has a share in profits. A technical parter can be ideal **if** you can trust the person enough for a long term relationship. ( IMHO )

Like Jeff said, you can make a counter agreement and be very specific who owns what so that should not be much of a concern.

On a sidenote, unless you are find a very good project manager, managing a team of programmers to get output in the direction you want is not as simple as it might sound.

You can write contracts to say whatever you want. If you don't like the terms the *potential* partner is offering then don't accept them. Either counter or find a different partner.

Personally I would never sign any agreement that sounds how you describe it. It sounds like the *partner* is trying to contractually steal your project. Why are you even entertaining it?
