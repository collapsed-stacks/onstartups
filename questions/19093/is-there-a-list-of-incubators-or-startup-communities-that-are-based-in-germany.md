There are lots of lists of incubators around (eg please see [OnStartups question 8614](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/8614/is-there-an-index-of-startup-incubators-around-the-world)) however the majority are based in the US, with just a few in Europe.

(Please see [OnStartups question 18887](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/18887/) for a list of startup companies that are based in Germany.)

Does anyone know of any incubators that are in Germany?

<p>The Founder Institute <a href="http://founderinstitute.com/apply/berlin" rel="nofollow">now operates in Berlin</a>. That would be the only American incubator, from Silicon Valley, in Europe.</p>

Wow, the answers here are ancient.

As of May 2013, the best way to find startups, events, incubators and investors in Germany is via AngelList - https://angel.co/germany

You can also visualize them on a map - http://startupsbio.me/

There are many incubators, it depends also on the industry you're interested in:

 -   As mentioned above, Berlin is big in webdesign, etc.
 -   You'll find engineering (mechanical and chemical, biotech) in and around Aachen
 -   Munich and Stuttgart has a lot going on regarding automotive
 -   Munich in general has a lot going on regarding IT
 -   There is quite a bit of biotech in Düsseldorf

Hope this helps.
