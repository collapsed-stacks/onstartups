You should not have a unanimity requirement.

In that situation, a person who owns 0.000001% of the company can refuse to agree to do something that is clearly in the best interests of the company in order to get some kind of concession from the rest of the shareholders.  I've seen this happen in situations where a very high percentage was required (I think it was 98%).
