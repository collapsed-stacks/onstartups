I'm interested to find out these statistics (below), or estimates per sector for e-commerce websites in the united states.

If you have access to this kind of data, sharing it will help us alot because we can have better estimates for our startup potential. If you have any other statistic on e-commerce website, please share it here :)

* Sector
* Number of e-commerce websites in sector
* Avg Income per each website in sector
* Avg Revenue (% from Income)

Thanks in advance for your help!
