## What can you do when someone blatantly plagiarizes an entire blog post?

It's nice when folks quote parts of your post with a link back.  It's another thing when the entire RSS entry is duplicated verbatim, including my "Retweet" buttons and the "Please leave a comment" that still links back to my blog.

Duh!  They didn't even try.

Is there any recourse for what is clearly a copyright violation?  A recourse that doesn't cost more to implement than it's worth in damages?

<p>Yes, there is an easy recourse. You send the infringer <em>AND</em>  the hosting service a <strong>DMCA copyright infringment notice</strong>. Give the infringer a few days to remove the material. If he doesn't the web site host <strong>will</strong> remove the offending material for him <em>(and probably remove his hosting account)</em>.</p>

<p>There is a standard format for DMCA notices and if you do not follow the format, some hosts will not remove the material. See: <a href="http://www.mcanerin.com/en/articles/copyright-03.asp">DMCA Notice</a></p>

<p>This does work. See the Google explanation: <a href="http://www.google.com/dmca.html">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a></p>

<p>It's also free.</p>

<p>People copy websites all the time. The DMCA notice is the fastest way to get things removed. It usually ends up with the web hosting firm, and not the person stealing the information.</p>

A bit more information for you:

**Sample letter to the infringer**

Website Copyright Cease and Desist Order

To: 

You are in violation, as you are using a number of works that I own the copyright to. These appear on a site operated by you at <<INFRINGING LINK>>. I have reserved all rights to this work, which was first published on <<Date>> on <<Your Site URL>>.

Your unauthorized use of the work in the link above is unlawful, pursuant to the federal copyright act. Permission was neither asked for nor granted to reproduce my Work, which constitutes infringement of my rights. In terms of the Copyright Statutes, I believe you have willfully infringed my rights under 17 USC §101, et seq. and you could be held liable for substantial statutory damages as high as $150,000, as set forth in Section 504(c)(2) therein. Attorney’s fees and costs can also be recovered. Moreover, copyright infringement is a direct violation of International Copyright Law and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Your continued infringement entitles me to an injunction, and puts you at risk for associated damages.

I demand that you immediately cease the use and distribution of all infringing works derived from my work, and all copies of it, and that you remove any further works you may have stolen and that you desist from this or any other infringement of my rights in the future.

Accordingly, if you do not comply within 72 hours, I’ll have no other choice but to initiate contact with your site’s ISP or Web Hosting Provider along with each major search engine. Full litigation will follow.

Yours very truly,
[Sign and make sure you have the correct owner of the copyrighted material]

I'm actually dealing with this right now. Before resorting to a DCMA I've contacted the blog owner direct and politely asked him to credit me with the content & link back or remove it (and I've explained why I need this).

If he does not respond within 2-3 days I'll contact the host with the same (polite) request and ask them to forward it to the customer, with evidence & notice that I've tried contacting the content writer and a DCMA will be pending otherwise.

Hope this helps,
Alex

If you put your entire posts content into your RSS feed then that's what's going to output to feed readers, like Google reader (who monetizes against your feed)... which is not your website also... so why do you care that its being viewed somewhere else then?

You can limit your rss feed to show just the titles or even limited amounts of your posts... just do that and they won't scrape your whole post.

It's hard to swallow, but it may just be worth letting it pass and accepting that these things happen on the Internet.  

If it's just some spammer or automated process trying to pick up some Adsense crumbs, the chances are he will slip into Google supplementals and you will almost certainly outrank him on any relevant keywords.  Google is very good at this stuff now.

If it's some guy really trying to pass off your work for personal gain, he won't really get very far in anything if he operates like this and can't even come up with an original thought for a blog post.  Karma is good at this stuff now :)

Kinda skipped through a lot so maybe I'm not clear on the subject. But as far as I know, if they don't quote *every* single word, and only quote snippets and add in their own text, then it's not officially plagiarized. The law is you can change 20% of the content/image/product/item/etc., and it's theirs to keep *so to speak*.

Otherwise if it's the opposite of that, then yea the DCMA notice is the bomb of all bombs. It wipes them out, cleans them up and shuts them down. Good luck.
