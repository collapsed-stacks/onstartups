what resources do you use for statistics on things like: how many people have iphones, how many ipads, android , etc and split by countries if possible. Do you know any site to offer such statistics?

<p>Have you tried <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com" rel="nofollow">Gs.Statcounter</a>?</p>

<p>They have stats about Mobile OS, Browsers, Destkop OS, etc., and it shows a graph for a time range (which you can specify!) and also you can see results country wise.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/swK43.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Though, it doesn't have absolute no. of users (which is anyways hard to get) and I'd not say that the results are completely accurate, but for me the results are good enough.</p>

It depends on what you want this information for, but I use google analytics, because it will show me what technology people that hit my website are using. For me, I don't care what everyone else is using, I care what my potential customers are using.  Your target audience is not necessarily using the same as general averages, it could in fact vary dramatically.
