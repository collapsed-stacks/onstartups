## Investor sniffing around - time to launch?

I have a prototype product.   I have shown it to a few people and have a couple very interested investors (friends) who want to help me launch a viable product to build a pitch deck and business plan around.

One of the two investors wants to see a contract and I want one for both of them actually.

Their investment amount isn't very much money really... a couple grand total... but my wife and I don't want to be fiscally responsible for the money if things don't pan out.

Is it worth the headache and financial burden to go ahead and form the LLC and then base the documents from there?   The cost would be something like $800 in legal and filing fees... which I can spread across a couple months.
