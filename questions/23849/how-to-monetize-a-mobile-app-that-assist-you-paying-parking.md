I am wondering how to monetize a mobile app that will assists you paying parking by sending SMS to the operator, and assisting with other aspects in parking.

The usage will be in this step:

End-user -> My App -> GSM Operator -> SMS Parking Service Company -> Parking company.

What I would offer is just a helper app for the end-users, so that they don't have to type in each time the plate, time, phone number to be able to pay.
Both the GSM Operator and SMS Parking Service Company take their share from the amount, and finally the Parking company takes the final amount.

What do you have in mind?

Actually, I believe its a very viable idea, particularly in larger U.S. and European cities. I think the best way to get this done is along the lines of targeting actual parking chains and municipal entities that have plans to install smart meters. Just make sure you have an actual working demo vs. a presentation deck and a bunch of vaporware.
