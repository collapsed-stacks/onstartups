My undersntanding is that there is no legal difference between naming my S Corporation `MyCompanyName Incorporated` vs `MyCompanyName Corporation`. 

However, are there any preferences on which one to use? Any reasons to go for one over the other?

Based on my experience, this is an aesthetic issue that blends into a marketing issue.

The form that I have seen the most - and, thus, is likely to be read the most easily, raising the fewest eyebrows - is MyCompanyName, Inc.

<p>There's no legal difference - it's up to you. Check out how others have done it: <a href="http://www.seravia.com" rel="nofollow">www.seravia.com</a>, go to "Biz Snapshots" and do a search for company names you know off the top of your head. See what they use and what you think about them (Microsoft Corp. - Facebook, Inc.)</p>

I've incorporated several companies, and my experience is that you're right, there's no legal difference.

Go for whichever one you like better. Depending on what MyCompanyName actually is, one may simply sound or look better than the other.
