<p>I need a Java professional who can lead small Android and web based projects/products. I have experience in .net though, but I barely have any experience in Java. Being a new and a "Lean" startup, I really cannot match industry norms contract payment. Also should approach probable partner/consultant on a short term contract basis, or what should my approach be?</p>
