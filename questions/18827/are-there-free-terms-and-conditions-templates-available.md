I'm about to release my web app, and want a basic document that says "hey, when you pay us you're getting access to the app for a year.  We reserve the right to change the app in ways that we think improve it at any time."  Is there anywhere I can find this sort of basic document for free, or should I head to the lawyer's office with my wallet?

<p>The "Search" field is your friend. :-)</p>

<p>Or more alternatively, the <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/terms-and-conditions">browse by tags feature</a> is perhaps the best place to start. I would say start with:</p>

</ol>
