I have noticed that for the past few months, I have been wasting a lot of time on needless things.  How do you keep yourself focused in your business?

At the end of each day we each post a status update of what we did, what we got stuck on, what we where going to do next into a skype chat room so everyone else can see what is being done. Having to account daily for your actions is a great way to stay on track.

<li>Keep the distractions out of the office. Idiotic foosball tables, Xboxes, beer fridges, etc. Why? Work hard at work, play hard at home. I talk deeper about it in one of my articles:

<li>Use of Agile in business is fantastic. We do it at our company and it works like a charm.
Yep, you guessed it, just wrote an article about it after being interviewed by a WSJ journo.

The behavior you describe is a pretty good indication that something is wrong.

If the majority of the people is goofing off, the problem is probably how the organization is managed.

However, even if the problem only affect a few people, this doesn't means they are solely responsible for this. I've need many problems like that, and the root cause included (but not only):

- wrong position for the guy/girl (after a promotion, or company merge)
- harassment (sadly, happens too often, and very difficult for the management to find out before the guy/girl leaves)
- personal problems including health problems, separation, death, etc.

I would recommend that you take the time, as a manager, to identify the root cause. Book a meeting with the girl/guy and start discussing.

<p>Daily (yes, daily) short (about 3-5min/member) huddles at all levels. Borrowed it from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29#Meetings" rel="nofollow">Scrum</a>. As you go up the chain, from team to dept to management, the meetings get broader in scope obviously. Individuals may talk about specific tasks, while management may cover changes in metric trends.</p>

<p>In fact, scrum is a great general project management technique if you ignore the software development-specific bits.</p>

<p>Each huddle, you must "answer me these questions three":</p>

<ol>
<li>Did you finish what you promised yesterday?</li>
<li>What will you do today?</li>
<li>What could impede your work today?</li>
<li>"Bonus round": anything notable or interesting?</li>
</ol>

<p>When any team member continually over-promises and/or under-delivers, first we see if the root issues can be drawn out, we solve, and if there is no solution or continued problems, the individual gets "voted off the island".</p>

<p>ADDED: This will go contrary to command-and-control types, but I worry about point "B", not how my staff gets there. IOW, are there clear goals and metrics? Are they hitting them? If so, what does it matter if they blow steam playing Farmville for a bit?</p>

This is a big topic but I think this is the most crucial bit:

Yourself:

 - Have a good, very good task list and do one thing at a time, if needed leave 15 min. break quickly goof around, facebook, news sites, RSS etc. and then move to the next item
 - You don't have a task list? [Stop now, slap yourself, find a tool/web app to do this and start using it now]
 - Keep tasks small, one task should not be more than 1 hour

Team:

 - Have a them a tasklist,
 - Expect results (not time commitment)
 - Teach them how you get things done and help them to learn tricks from you
 - If they consistently don't deliver, pep-talk, try-to-understand. If they still don't deliver fire get a new and better one

<p>Ok, I have an answer which is totally logical but some people might not like. You need to monitor the exact hours worked by your staff, and monitor Internet use and computer use during those hours. It's important to not JUST monitor, but if you have no monitoring at all you will for sure be losing some productivity to "goofing off". Check out <a href="http://www.timedoctor.com" rel="nofollow">www.timedoctor.com</a> (my software) or <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com" rel="nofollow">www.rescuetime.com</a> to implement this type of monitoring.</p>
