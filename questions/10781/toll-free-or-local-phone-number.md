I'm getting a phone for my new business and I'm debating to either get a 888 number or a local one.

My main concern is high phone bills on a 888 number, when I will get support and other calls.

At the other side of the coin, with a 888 number the company looks national, while a local number puts a pin on the map in the user's mind.

What's your experience on this?

Toll free is crazy cheap these days. If you are using a landline look at pioneer telephone.com. If you want something more flexible maybe http://grasshopper.com/ would serve you. I definitely would not let cost concerns hold you back. 

Keep in mind if you expect international callers you will also want to publish a 'local' number as reaching toll free prefixes is difficult from most places outside the US and Canada.

If you find yourself spending a lot on support calls that will be a strong signal to you...

<p>My experience is that a toll free number is still used and much appreciated by customers. See <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/4703/launch-on-a-tiny-budget/4710#4710" rel="nofollow">my prior answer about toll free numbers here</a> and the related comments that it sparked.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T just recently offered to add our toll free number to our unlimited long distance outbound coverage for a flat $12 per month. I think this kind of pricing makes it a no brainer.</p>

Though most folks can call from their cell and not get charged long distance, many large organization still restrict LD calling. So you really don't have a choice, if any of your customers work for such organizations.

That all said, as your volume goes up, you will be able to get a better rate. I recall paying under 1cent per minute at one of my companies, but we also had 10K+ minutes worth of incoming calls.
