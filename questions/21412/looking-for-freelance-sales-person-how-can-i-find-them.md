I'm looking for a sales person to help me in my new startup. 

We are targeting the high end restaurant marketplace.

I understand the product and can pitch the idea. But I am having difficultly getting into contact with Clients.

Wondering if I can find some sales guy who can work with me on commission.

Approach #1:

Wine is one of the high end things sold to high end restaurants.  Find out who are the fine wine distributors in your area and ask to talk to a salesman.  These wine salesmen may not be allowed to freelance on the side but they may know some other guys in the business who will.

Approach #2

Go to the managers of ten high end restaurants in your general area and ask them who is the best salesman they deal with on a regular basis.

Restaurant managers are extremely busy and don't want to waste any time. Go to the restaurant one or two hours before they officially open for regular business.  Keep your question very brief.  Don't give any background up front.  Only give the background when and if the manager asks you.

If you go to 10 restaurants you may be able to pitch the short question to 5 managers.  Maybe three will give you any kind of answer.  One may engage you in a short 5 minute conversation.

<p>One option would be to go through an online freelancing agency, like <a href="https://odesk.com" rel="nofollow">https://odesk.com</a> or <a href="https://elance.com" rel="nofollow">https://elance.com</a>. I personally have had poor luck outsourcing labor, but I also tried to do it as cheap as possible. There are many other companies that have had huge success using these sites. Don't be afraid to spend a little more money to get a great worker, and don't be afraid to turn down a lot of people until you find someone worth your money.</p>

If you want to find someone who specializes knows how to sell web design but don't know how to sell yourself, that's going to be challenging. Unless your projects are pretty good, you're unlikely to find someone..

Generally, I would recommend going where your target market is and do some research into who else sells to them.

For example, if you do web design for restaurants, check to see if there are industry groups or university hospitality programs in your area. Local chambers of commerce might be a good match too.

Alternatively, talk to your current customers and see how they found you. They may refer leads your way (problem solved!) or there may be a particular niche that you're appealing to and didn't even know. Then research, attend, meet, and repeat.
