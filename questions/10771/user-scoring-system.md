I would like to add a simple "points system" on one of my sites that will encourage users provide feedback. Something similar to the one used on this site but not as convoluted.

Here's the basic scenario: User "A" can post a project. Other users see the post and if interested can submit their application for it. User "A" can review submissions and accept some. After the project complete this user can provide feedback for those that he/she was actually involved with during the project.

So, there are several items that can be used in the formula to score user "A":

1. How many projects created 
2. How many tasks within project posted
3. How many submissions accepted (I guess I need to consider what was the total number of submissions too)
4. How many feedback comments submitted.

Perhaps besides the score I can have some milestone awards (kind of like badges on this site).

Any mathematicians out there willing to give it a crack? 

Thanks for reading this.

BTW Did you know that Google's PageRank score, although used to score webpages according to a formular, is named after Larry Page, Google's co-founder.

I don't have a formula for you, but I think you should also consider the number of reads a project has had, along definitely with the number of submissions received and the number accepted.

There seems to be a hint that in most cases there's a virtual team being formed - so another variable could be the number of members sought.
