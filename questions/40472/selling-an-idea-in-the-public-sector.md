Me and my partner are working on an idea for a text (SMS) service that we intend to pitch to the National Health Service in the UK as it could potentially save them a lot of money. However, minus the idea, they already have the technology, framework, and (presumably) budget to be able to implement and promote it themselves, and it seems silly to me that they should have to pay someone else before being legally able to do this.

1. Can/should the idea be protected before pitching it?
2. If successful, how is the buyout conducted? Would it be a lumpsum or could it potentially be a proportion of the money saved?

Thanks very much in advance.

Nobody buys an idea. I would be a trilnionare by now. I mean, well written, designed, planned ideas with a good marketing before the idea was finished.
The thing is, that you can sell them services once you have it working, and you will need to comply with public services rules and requirements.

What you can do, is to make some marketing materials (brochures etc), an offer, and once they agree to T&C, deliver it, it's simple as that.

I dont think Hospitals are purchasing any companies. Public sector doesnt work this way most of the time.

As mr. Smith said, nobody buys an idea.

But in the public sector? Things can be different. If you have a big tooth to push the right buttons, sure. If not, bad luck there too.
