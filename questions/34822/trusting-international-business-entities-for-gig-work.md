My wife is considering ultimately starting a small consulting business, and in order to get into the industry a bit, she is considering doing small paid "gigs" in her field, which is translation and voice work, conducted through telecommuting/internet.

Some of these gigs, found online, are with businesses in distant countries.  We are in the U.S.  My question is:  how can one best ascertain whether a business 8,000 miles away (for example) is a trustworthy entity--as opposed to, at worst, some sort of identity phishing scam?  Is there any general approach that one should take in these cases?

The kind of work, you mentioned are mostly phishing. They need to be considered with a pinch of salt. More appropriate is to join, some freelancing such as freelancer.com, odesk.com, elance.com to find trustworthy work.
