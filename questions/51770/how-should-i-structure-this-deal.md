<p>I am running a small FMCG business. The products is in good demand in the market, but I am facing all issues of small business, such as capital shortage, no team. At present it not making money. Two people known to me approached me for partnership by investing money. The deal is each one will invest money equal to present assets' value of company. Nothing will be paid for product technology, formulations (not patent-able but huge differentiator, that is why they want to invest). They will not join as active partners but keep their well paid occupation at least for now. They will take care of finance, accounts and other legal and govt related activities and I will look after production and marketing along with team that will be hired. I will paid salary that will be 15% of what I would get as working for other company as a professional. I feel this is not fair deal. How should I structure this deal? Looking forward to advice.</p>
