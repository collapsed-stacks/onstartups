I hired a web development company to build my web site.  At the end of the year, is there any tax liability?  It's a straight forward contract.  Is the web development company considered an independent contractor?  Anyone know?  Thanks!

Assuming you're in the US, and it's more than $600 you just need to file a 1099 for them. If it's less than $600 you need do nothing.
