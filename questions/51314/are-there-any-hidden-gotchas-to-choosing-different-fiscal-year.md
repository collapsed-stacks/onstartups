<p>I'm setting up a C-Corporation (its Mid October at time of this writing) and planning a Kickstarter project projecting to raise $100k in funds by late November.  As I understanding, KS funds are fully taxable funds. </p>

<p>....and with it being nearly end of the year, I would not have the time to spend (ahem, expense) the KS funds before Dec 31st, so I am considering simply declaring a different close (i.e. June) for my Fiscal Year when I establish the C-Corporation.</p>

<p>What should I be aware of before doing this?  Any hidden gotchas and/or complications to doing so other than when my tax filing dates are?</p>

<p>If you fall under the definition of PSC (<a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p542/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000257744" rel="nofollow">Personal Services Corporation</a>), you're specifically required to chose a calendar year unless you make a "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/444" rel="nofollow">Sec. 444 election</a>", if you're eligible. The election is not trivial, and will <a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p538/ar02.html#en_US_201212_publink1000270602" rel="nofollow">require certain things from you</a>.</p>

<p>If you're the owner and the main employee of your corporation - you probably have a PSC.</p>

<p>I suggest you get a good EA/CPA licensed in your state to guide you through this. Don't forget that C-Corps are subjected to double taxation at corporate rates (<a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/tax-differences-between-corporation-personal-service-corporation-60207.html" rel="nofollow">35% flat for PSC</a>), and there are additional limitations on PSCs.</p>

<p>How many investors do you have?<br>
Revenue?<br>
I would highly advise against a C-Corp. Go with an S until you must absolutely drop it, your tax advantages are much greater. Not to mention a lot less paperwork burden. Also you can always revert an S-Corp to C-Corp<br>
For S-Corp you need calendar year, or specially approved tax year, so unless there is an absolute need for change keep calendar year<br>
For C-Corp it's whatever you choose<br>
Also realize choosing a different fiscal year period doesn't change when tax returns are due<br>
You still must pay quarterly</p>
