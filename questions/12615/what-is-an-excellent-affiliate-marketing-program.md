I have some questions regarding affiliate marketing:

1. What are the features you consider essential/required (or merely nice to have) in a "kick ass" affiliate program?

2. What are some good affiliate marketing sites out there?

3. If I was to start a new affiliate marketing site, what is the best way to promote it to:
  - affiliates
  - merchants


4. What features/benefits *MUST* a website offering affiliate marketing offer to make it a 'compelling proposition' for:
  - affiliates
  - merchants

It's a tough market, as Shareasale, Clickbank and Commission Junction pretty much dominate.

The great advantage for them is that affiliates can work with numerous products and websites, earning a few bucks from each. Because all their merchants come from one of those 3, it's nice and simple - plus they have a reasonable chance of reaching the minimum payout.

So I'm afraid really, the answer to your question is "Be one of those Big 3".

OK, 4 if you include Amazon.

To be blunt, you probably have more chance of making money as an affiliate than you do as an affiliate company.
