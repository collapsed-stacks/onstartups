I want to start multiple businesses.  For these businesses I would like to have a separate checking account, telephone number, mailing address.

What do you suggest to make this as simple as possible to setup?

For example can you recommend a bank where it is easy to setup multiple checking accounts with debit cards?  The best would be to have one login but still be able to access multiple checking accounts.

Further more I would like to have a separate telephone number for each business.  Is there a company where it would be easy to get multiple telephone numbers and forward those numbers to my cellphone?

Same with mailing addresses.

Can you offer any help?  Thanks!

Most any bank.

Most any telephone company.

Most any PO Box(s).

And a secure notepad ;)

<p>Regarding the phone numbers - I would create a <a href="http://google.com/voice" rel="nofollow">Google Voice</a> number for each business and set them to all forward to your main number. You can have one number per account - so create an account for each business and manage them from there. You'll also be able to make/accept calls from your machine with nothing but headphones and a built-in mic, and access a log of calls for each number this way.</p>

<p>I use Google Voice for personal calls and highly recommend it, but I'm not familiar with other free VOIP services so I'd do some comparison shopping first. From what I know, however, if I were doing this I'd stay far away from traditional phone companies and plans.</p>

If you are going to own multiple businesses, one smart strategy (accounting and liablity wise) is to for a Corporation that owns each business as an S-Corp.

Or you can do an S-corp that owns a bunch of LLC's
The reason for this is it gives you the protection and privacy of a corporation but also gives you a level (at the top) where you can offset incomes and losses and possibly lower your overall tax burden.  Plus its good for the parent company to build up its credit and income history, in case 5 years from now you setup a new child business and need to vouch for it in terms of credit for a lease, credit line, etc.

A simpler approach is to:
1. Create a bank account for each business. I would use the same bank.
2. Create a phone number for each business, most hosted PBX services allow multiple numbers and call routing based on number (meaning you only need 1 physical phone per employee)
3. Just get one mail box for the whole thing. Its a pain in the ass to change addresses when you have multiple business.  If nobody is going to visit your "office" or mail box, then there is no reason to pay for 2, 3 or 10.  One will do .
