I am going to embark very soon on a software venture (have been a consultant and employee up until now).

I see advantages in signing up for Microsoft's BizSpark.

However, I wonder if doing so would preclude me from accepting funding from some equity-esque arrangements potentially available via crowdfunding.

I know BizSpark's legal agreement probably spells this out, but it's about a gazillion pages long, so I'm hoping somebody here has existing knowledge of this so I don't have to spend a lot of time reading legalese.

The eligibility requirements are stated in Annex D (the last page of the agreement), which simply states that:

> Except for locales listed in the table below, the Startup must have
> revenue less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) annually. If the
> Startupâ€™s place of business is not listed below then the Startup must
> have revenue of less than one million dollars annually:

    Annual revenue must be less than:
    China       
    $750,000
    Korea, Malaysia, Poland, Russia, Spain, Ukraine
    $500,000
    Egypt, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam
    $250,000

There are some additional requirements, but those are the monetary requirements.  I would imagine that Microsoft considers "revenue" to be money earned from sales, but you might want to clarify that with them.

Funding doesn't forbid you from being in the program. The program doesn't forbid you from getting funding. In fact, it's been my experience that getting into the program and using low cost and free development tools makes it easier for you to put any funding you get towards your startup in other ways, like growing traction, ramping up employee numbers.
