Is it possible for a teen to form an LLC/C-Corp? If so, what are the costs, the process and the requirements?

I'm a US Citizen but currently live in Bosnia. I'm 17, turning 18 on December 2nd.

<p>If you want to form the LLC in the U.S., the answer probably will depend on the state in which the LLC is formed.</p>

<p>For example, in CA a minor (under 18 years old) cannot enter into an LLC operating agreement because the LLC membership interest would constitute personal property not in the minor's immediate possession or control.

<p>The legal age to sign a contract in the U.S. is 18. Any contract signed before that age is void.</p>

<p>So you as a sub-18 teen can not form an LLC.</p>
