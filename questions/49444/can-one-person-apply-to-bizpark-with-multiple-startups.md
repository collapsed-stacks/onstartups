I am working on a number of mobile apps, each one very different from the other. I want to apply to Bizpark, but I heard that investors don't like the idea of someone working on multiple different projects. So I image it's best to apply for each app as a different startup.

Is one person allowed to apply to Bizpark with multiple simultaneous startups?

First, Microsoft BizSpark does not invest in companies, so we don't look at your company as an investor would. Second, if you are building apps, and each is different than the other, but your single entity is building those apps, it's best to apply under one entity. It's not likely that you would be able to apply with multiple entities in the scenario you describe.

Given that supposedly each startup is given mentoring and space within an incubator, does it seem reasonable that you occupy multiple footprints? If there are so many apps, why not create a platform and have each app become a sample implementation. One of the questions that investors ask when looking at new technology is
  1. is it a feature
  2. or actually a product line
  3. can it become a business 

If you can make the case that it is a product line with the platform being the springboard, it may be possible to spin it into an ecosystem a la twitter or license fields of use separately.
