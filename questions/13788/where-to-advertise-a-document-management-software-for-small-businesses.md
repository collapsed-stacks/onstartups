We sell a document management software designed for small businesses. 

I would appreciate any ideas about what would be the best places to advertise such an application to small businesses (assuming an advertising budget of around $5000). Most of our customers are based in the US. 

We have tried Google Adwords. We are considering advertising on Linked-In. Anyone's had success with that?

You should contact application (web) blogs. Its kind of like a press release and you will get a lot of exposure. 

http://web.appstorm.net/ < Start there. They do this service called Quick Look. Here are some benefits. http://web.appstorm.net/why-quick-look/

You will gain so much exposure I can tell you that. It costs $50.

<p>There are some pretty cool niche ad networks.  One that comes to mind is <a href="http://carbonads.net" rel="nofollow">CarbonAds</a></p>

Try to get in contact with a B2B business that will act as the "in between" between you and the consumers. Document management solutions are on demand now because of increased security threats.

<p>Also consider complimentary products offered by other companies whom you may already be partnered up with.  They should already have established sales channels.  Adwords is tough (competitive) if you aren't narrowed down to a local area.</p>

Contact local or nationwide Business Associations and provide their Members with a small Discount if they buy from you. It will only cost you to search for the contact details and to write a letter.

However, this might take some time. So it's nothing to do in a hurry. But it's another way to get more exposure.

Patrick, For how long you used gooogle adwords? Your campaign was only for search engine or textual links too?

I believe google adword must have provided you targeted traffic if used properly. My suggestions to you is:

1. Let professional do your google adword.
2. Join small business communities/forums like young entrepreneur, entrepreneur, biznik and post article how your software can help small business owners.

Your marketing should be solution oriented rather than product oriented and it will work.

Patrick, expanding on what Adam wrote, look for companies that provide related services to your target market and try to partner with them on a revenue share. The primary objective is to gain exposure and validation; the revenues will come in time. I would like to see what your product as I may have some contacts for you. Good luck.
