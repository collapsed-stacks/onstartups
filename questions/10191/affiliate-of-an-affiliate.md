**This maybe a really dumb question, but i wanted to know if it was possible/legal to do this.**

I would like to offer affiliate partners a chance to take a piece of my affiliate sales. For example Apple offers a 5% commission on items stored in the App store. I would like to offer my partners half of that 5% for driving traffic to itunes. Is this possible?

Do anyone know of an affiliate company (like commission junction or linkshare) that would be ok with such a tactic?

I have done this with most popular brokers out there (CJ, LS, etc...). Each merchant may or may not allow sub-affiliates though. It should clearly state if this is permissible on the merchant page within the broker's site. 

It is important though to make sure that the broker is aware of your intentions and you are honest in your description and intended usage of your merchant relationships. For instance, you cannot present yourself as a non-incentivized affiliate even though you aren't but your sub-affiliates may be.

Some merchants may also ask to review each of your sub-affiliates which can be a very tedious process.

Hope this helps.

tl;dr. Yes it is possible with all brokers.

This is generally called a tiered affiliate structure and is quite common.  I cannot speak to specific sites, however, I would assume they would allow you to do this.

<p>Look into CPA networks (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_network#CPA_network" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a>): CPA networks take advantage of the ability to get higher commission rates due to their high volume, which they pass in part down to their affiliates. Average affiliates usually get paid a lower commission if they promote the merchant directly, because they are rarely able to generate the required volume to reach the higher payout tiers.</p>
