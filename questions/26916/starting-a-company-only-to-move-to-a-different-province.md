I was going to register my business in Ontario, but may be moving to BC in the next 4 months.  Should I even bother? Will my registeration keep?
I am guessing I can't write off items (I need a few licenses) until my business is registered.

Also one question (in the business registry) asks if I will be hiring contractors,  I am guessing even if it's a one time job of 5 hours (lets say hooking a network up/drawing a logo) that would count as hiring contractors?

Thanks!

Have you thought about ignoring the provincial corporation, and just registering federally? I registered mine Federally due to precisely this problem.  It's actually cheaper to register federally, as opposed to provincially, at least for the first two years of a corporation's existence.
