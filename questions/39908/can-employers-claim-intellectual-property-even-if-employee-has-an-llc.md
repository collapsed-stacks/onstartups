<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

I have my own LLC. I created it during my time of unemployement. The LLC is for creating software, specifically mobile apps. This LLC is based in New Jersey.

I have recently been employed by a company in NYC. If I create an app and release it on the market under the name of the LLC, can the company I work for claim the app under intellectual property?

I would be the one creating and releasing the app but under another company, but I am a part of both companies, so I'm not sure if my LLC can protect my creations from the other company.

I know an LLC is a legal entity.
