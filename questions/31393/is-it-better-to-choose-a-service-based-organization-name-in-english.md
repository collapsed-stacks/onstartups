I plan to provide a service in Canada. For instance in the french province (composed of 15% anglo population) of Quebec.

The service should work outside Quebec, so my question is should I choose a name in French or in English? Or do I create both? I would prefer only one to simplify trademark process...

thx

You should stick with one name that works for everyone.
