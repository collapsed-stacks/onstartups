I'm a freelance webdeveloper (thus I have my own company). I'm now working on a new project which involves webdevelopment but will not provide it as an end product: it will be a web application to be sold to schools and universities.

I'm wondering if I should start up a new company for this product. Reasons to say yes:

* It has nothing to do with my business as a freelancer
* It will be easier to split any of the companies into two when I find a business partner later on (because he wouldn't have to participate in both the freelancing as this product)

Reasons to say no:

* Setting up a new company will cost time and effort
* I'd have to file my quarterly tax reports twice
* As long as both companies are one-man businesses, there's no financial reason to have two companies: if one goes bankrupt, the other goes as well (and I'm going down as well)

Although the reasons for no seem weak, I think that's what I'm going to do (i.e. have only one company). I can split later on anyway, and I don't want to spend too much time on administrative activities.

Is there anything I'm missing here? Any really good convincing reason for one of the two options?

I'm located in the Netherlands.

Unfortunately this question is too difficult to answer. It's really based on individual preferences. 

For instance, I would prefer to keep a product and a service company separate. If you offer web development under one name, I would recommend offering the product under another. There are many reasons for this, but chief amongst them, for me at least, is the fact that they are totally different. If you were offering web development and software development, or a web product and a different product, I would say there's really no reason to split them, as they're still basically the same and companies stay as one even when they offer multiple products.

While it would increase your business administration burden, it will allow you to keep to two completely different things separate.

But, then again, there's HP which provides services to businesses as well as products (computers, servers, etc.) so there really is no one size fits all answer here.

In the end it comes down to your personal preference.

As a business owner you need to think of the future. Are you planning on soliciting for a partner for either (or both) lines of business? It may be easier to split them now if that's the case. This includes if you're planning on doing any equity splitting of either. You don't want to give equity for your web development side of things if you're seeking a partner in the product, or vice-verse.

If you're not planning on doing that, I would say just keep them together.

I'm faced with similar issues, and personally prefer to keep all of my income streams into one company. I like to think of my company as the single 'vessel' where my income comes from, even though that company gets it from various sources.

As I see it, as a webdev freelancer like we both are, it's actually very good to have income from various sources: freelance assignments, passive income on courses, services that we made, products that we sell. It makes for a solid foundation of your company's financials.

If, in the future, you would like to expand a team around your product, take in a partner, investor, etc, you can always make a new company and transfer the IP from your freelancing company to the newly found company.

It's really simple; keep it under one company until you need to split it into two (for whatever reason). Then split it into two. Now stop wasting time thinking about things like this and focus on building a profitable product.
