I have just finished designing the concept of my service, that is, what I am going to offer to people has crystallized. there are various components to this, and I will look for cofounders now, and then the validation process will come.

I am really confident of the service. But I am really not the type to do lalala talk, rather prefer to point to the product; here, try it, and see if you like. I read that it is recommended to write a blog to spread the word, get press, publicity etc. I mean, if you have a good product, you can do without, too, can't you? I don't mean to make no publicity, you spread the word by all other means, but what do you really write in a blog every other day? 
"today I was very productive and made an important progress with my partners.." sorry, but who bothers?..or "today the development of the first version of that unique product feature was finished.." 
who even reads your blog before you are known? potential investors? I should think they will be more convinced seeing the prototype that you're writing about.
I was never into blogging, and it seems to me all the less necessary among all the meaningful work you can do at this critical phase.

after all, who'd blogged while founding?..page? brin? zennstroem?..

Is a startup blog necessary? no.  

Does it help? probably.

If you are at the stage of just finishing designing the concept of your service should you be worrying about this? no.

Just get your product built.  Even if a blog is great, it's still not as good as having a product so your time should be spent there.

Certainly your site is going to have something written about the product. Many blogs are "lalala" but yours doesn't have to be. It can be focused on your product, how you built it, why you built it, what you plan on doing next. 

> I am really confident of the service

This is good, but you need to find out what everyone else things before you put too much time into building it. Responses to your blog are more important than the blog itself. It doesn't have to be lengthy.

Just make sure your reluctance isn't the deciding factor. One hour spent on your blog could save days of unecessary coding.
