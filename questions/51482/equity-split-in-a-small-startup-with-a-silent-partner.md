<p>I'm starting a very small business, and I need some advice on a partnership arrangement with a silent partner, especially with regards to equity. </p>

<p>I came up with the idea and roped in a friend as a silent business partner to help finance the startup costs. He wants to continue in his full time job and will not be involved in any operations or management decisions. We will both probably put in an equal amount of investment for starting up, however running of the business will be taken care of by myself and he will not be responsible for any losses beyond his initial investment. He has expertise in certain areas of the business, so I will consult with him at key stages for advice in these areas. </p>

<p>The profit split could be that I will take a salary + sales commission and the remaining profits split 50-50 between both of us. He wants the equity split to be 51%-49% (51% to myself and I will be the director while he's listed as a shareholder), however I have concerns about this as I'm taking a much higher risk by quitting my job and running this full time, I'm not sure of his future commitment and I want to own 100% or at least most of the business in future. We discussed a buyout option as well, however I have no idea how this would work. </p>

<p>I would really appreciate if I could get some advice on:
1) Whether this partnership agreement is sound and fair, especially regarding the equity split.</p>

<p>2) What exactly does owning equity mean in terms of legalities e.g. will he have voting rights on certain matters? If he wants to leave the business one day, as the majority shareholder, what are my rights?</p>

<p>3) How would a buyout option negotiated right at the beginning work? It can't be as simple as the value of the business divided by your % share, and the remaining partner has to buyout that value right?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>DON'T MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT YOU HAVE DESCRIBED. Given what you said in your question the 49%/51% split sounds insane! </p>

<p>What you have described is complicated and unnecessary. You need to use the dynamic split. It will tell you exactly how much equity each person deserves which, in turn, will tell you how to divide up profits when the time comes. </p>
