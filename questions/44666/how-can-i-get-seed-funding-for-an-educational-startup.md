I have looked into Imagine k-12, and sadly they are closed to new applicants right now which I'm super bummed about, and NewSchools. How else can I get seed funding for an educational startup that is not necessarily a high tech educational product? 

Also, what sort of models succeed in this atmosphere?

<p>Without knowing the specifics of your product, or how much money you are seeking, here are some possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crowdfunding:</strong> Depending on what your solution/product is, crowdfunding may be the best option for you. I think <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/" rel="nofollow">Indiegogo</a> are the biggest players in crowdfunding right now, but there are others.</li>
<li><strong>AngelList:</strong> The goal of <a href="https://angel.co" rel="nofollow">AngelList</a> is to connect startups with investors, but I'm not sure how successful one would be on AngelList without a prior referral. They seem to have a large group of investors who have an interest in education. Currently there are 920 investors in the <a href="https://angel.co/k-12-education/investors" rel="nofollow">K-12 education market</a>, and 909 investors in the broader <a href="https://angel.co/education/investors" rel="nofollow">education market</a>. At the very least you can use this as a research tool to figure out which investors you want to reach out to personally.</li>
<li><strong>Grants:</strong> Search on Google for federal and state government grants. There are a lot of grants for the education sector, you just have to look for them. You may even find some private grants.</li>
<li><strong>Incubators and accelerators:</strong> Some incubators and accelerators have a broad focus, like <a href="http://ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">Y Combinator</a> and <a href="http://www.techstars.com/" rel="nofollow">TechStars</a>. But others focus on specific industries. Look for opportunities in both types. Note that not all of these programs will provide funding, but most will at least put you in front of investors.</li>
<li><strong>Friends and family:</strong> This could be a way to get a small amount of seed capital.</li>
<li><strong>Bank loan:</strong> If you have good credit and income, this may be another way to get a small amount of seed capital. You'll have to pay this back, so technically this isn't an investment, but it may give you a way to get started if you've exhausted other options.</li>
</ul>

<p>I agree with the above answer that you should look at a range of options, however there are a few other Education focused accelerators I am aware of if you are set on that.</p>

<p>Many other incubators are open to edtech startups, especially if they are connected to universities. My startup <a href="http://edspire.com" rel="nofollow">http://edspire.com</a> is incubated by Isis (connected to Oxford University) at <a href="http://incubator.isis-innovation.com/" rel="nofollow">http://incubator.isis-innovation.com/</a></p>
