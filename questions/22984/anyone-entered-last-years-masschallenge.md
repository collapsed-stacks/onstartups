I just entered [MassChallenge.org][1] and I was wondering if anyone had some experiences to share from last years event? Or any tips or tricks on what to do or what not to do there.

<p>Great question. I was actually a $50,000 winner (<a href="http://www.rentabilities.com">Rentabilities</a>) and have written a few blog articles on my experience. My company was actually invited to stay on as Mentors in Residence for next year's entrants too. </p>

<p>Here they are and hopefully they are helpful</p>

I went to one of the Mass Challenge speed networking event last night. And definitely walked away with the impression that even if you don't win. By showing up and competing, there is a lot to be gained. That said, I think we'll be joining this year.

Enter MassChallenge to gain the experience. If you win, that would be gravy. But even simply by participating, you are winning! I was (am) a first-time entrepreneur and was so glad to be part of a network that provided advice, ideas, camaraderie, energy. Enjoy the process and go pursue your start-up!
