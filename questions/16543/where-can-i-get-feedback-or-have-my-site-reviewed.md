There are many questions asked on this site about getting a website reviewed or feedback on a site that has just been released.

Given that this type of question is so common and it is a need of the community, can you provide some suggestions of good sites where I can go to get feedback or a review on a web site?

Try and provide examples where there will be a good response and feedback can be given clearly and reasonably quickly.

<p>Last year I launched <a href="http://www.conceptfeedback.com">ConceptFeedback.com</a> to do exactly that. We now have a community of nearly 10,000 web designers, developers, usability experts, and marketing gurus who share website feedback and advice for free (click the "Community" link in the main nav)!</p>

<p>We also have a hand-selected pool of website professionals who offer expert website evaluations in the areas of design, usability and strategy. This service is not free, but you are guaranteed website feedback in 48 hours or less from certified experts.</p>

<p>Please take a look and let me know what you think, I'd be very interested to hear your feedback on my service!</p>

If you have specific goals you want to achieve via the site (say, how easy is it to buy a book), you can use a service like http://www.usertesting.com/ to get some feedback.

<p>The best place I have found for this type of question is the <a href="http://www.asp-software.org/newmember.asp">ASP</a> <em>(Association of Software Professionals)</em>. They have an entire marketing newsgroup for questions of just this type. A typical web site review gets at least 10 (and usually more than 20) <strong>detailed</strong> reviews by different people. This is not an anonymous community- the ASP is comprised of numerous small and medium sized software developers and marketers, many of whom are very well known.</p>

<p>I have seen people requesting reviews of specific pages- like "What is wrong with my order page?". The answers are often great.</p>

<p>The down side to the ASP is that you can only access their newsgroups by joining them and paying a fee of $100 / yr. I find the money well worth it.</p>

The best place to get honest feedback is http://news.ycombinator.com (AKA HackerNews or HN)

Before you submit your site for feedback, you should do the following:

 1. Get yourself acclimated with the people, tone & feedback posts on HN
 2. Start posting and adding some value (for others) on HN to add some credibility

Good luck!

Are there any forums that deal with the topic of your site? If so you can, see if people there will help you out and give you comments/criticism*. That way you can get feedback from people who would visit the site to begin with. Also, try to make it easy for people to leave feedback directly from your site so that you can capture actual users.


*If you do this, please make sure that you get approval from the owners of the board or actively contribute to the board. Spam is never fun!

The best service is http://www.usertesting.com/. Also a lot of forums on site development have a special section where users review the sites on request. But as mentioned earlier, it's better to spend some time on such forums to get credibility and points.

Almost every good service is mentioned here except mine. ;)

In December, 2012 I launched a new service aimed at website improvement based on feedback from fellow founders and web designers. It's a one-for-one exchange. You get reviews in exchange for reviewing other sites.

http://www.criticue.com

Reviews are short (~50 words). A reviewer is shown a snapshot of the page he or she is supposed to comment upon but also has an option to open it in a new browser tab for a more detailed examination. 

Based on the feedback I received from the users, the majority of reviews are surprisingly useful, especially considering they're anonymous at the moment. It seems that the authors of websites submitted for critique are looking for quality feedback and are willing to do their part to help others in return.

Curiously enough, the look of the service itself is far from perfect; I launched it as an MVP less than 2 months ago. The new stunning design is in the pipeline. :) 

Please do have a look and send me your feedback. You can reach me on twitter @martinbilski
