What is the process of getting some custom cartoons created?

How to a find a good designer and what should I expect to pay?

Should I first draw draft cartoons to show the “concept” by self, or just explain the message I am trying to get across to the designer?

I would Google the topic I have in mind and look thought the image search for a style I like.  Then try to contact the designer to determine if they are interested in freelancing.  Often freelance designers will have a website displaying samples of their work with their contact information.   

I would also feel out their rates when contacting them.  The cost will depend on the work you are looking for.  You probably want to build in one or two revisions within the initial price.
  
I have worked with Patrick Wong before.  He is very good and his rates are reasonable.  www.patrick-wong.com

The following websites are places where some freelances post their work.

<p>I did hire a cartoonist to create some of my product's related cartoons. The cartoonist charged me around $60 per cartoon. I just provided the idea and couple of links of the appropriate poses from the web. So basically describe as much as you want and then the designer provided a pencil sketch. After couple of corrections the cartoon was finalized and he delivered the vector images of the final version.</p>

<p>I used the designer from this site <a href="http://www.customcartoonart.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.customcartoonart.com/</a></p>

<p>You can see the final result of my cartoons here (at the bottom of the article)
