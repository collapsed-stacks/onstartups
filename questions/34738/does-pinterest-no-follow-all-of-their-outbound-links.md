I am wondering whether or not search engine robots crawl, follow, and index links from pinterest.com. Or, do they block their outgoing links like facebook does? In other words, can a website build linkjuice by posting some of their pages to a pinterest board?

At the moment, it doesn't seem any of Pinterest's links (content credit links, or user profile links) are no-follow. This is from a quick check with Chrome's inspect element tool.

Also, please be polite even if you feel Tim is not being polite to you. Cheers! =)

After checking a few of the pins on Pinterest, it looks like they are in fact no-follow. No sure if this is universal across the site, but is in my small sample.
