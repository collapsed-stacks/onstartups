These type of videos belong to the group of 'kinetic typography' even though it's not all text. The program of choice is Adobe After Effects, even if it is not free.

What slatecatser wrote is still a good start point. such animation need lots of planning and thought!

here a step by step tutorial

if you google / youtube for 
'kinetic typography' 
you will find even more.

it might be possible to do it in Adobe Flash, but for some reason, I can't find any tutorials on that!

Well, hope it helps!

Cheers

<p>Well, it's not that difficult.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a script for voice-over talent and storyboard for visual artist</li>
<li>Record voice-over track (do it before animation).  There are some great programs out there. Here's a free one: <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Audacity</a></li>
<li>Lay audio track and create animation to match it. You'll need some sort of animation program. Flash would do, but there are some shareware ones that can do something similar.</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on a desired quality you may want to outsource it to some small shop or do it yourself.</p>

The answer by slatecaster is a good start. The video you showed used a lot of screen recording - there are a number of commercial, open source and free-ware tools that will do that for you - use the Google to find them for your operating system.

Are there any Multimedia Colleges in your area (there are at least three in Brisbane AU where I am - I would imagine larger cities would have more)? Perhaps you could approach them for voice talent, video editing and final production - they are more likely to have the latest and greatest tools for the job. If you were to provide appropriate funding you could get your project done as an assessment. At the very least you would know where to advertise for people to do the work relatively cheaper than a commercial shop.

Make sure to include responsibility for copyright in whatever contract you enter into - you need to be protected in case someone pulls some random (copyrighted) image, video clip or audio sample from the Internet to use. If you are dealing directly with students make sure you point out this clause - don't be sneaky about it.

Also, allowing the students to freely distribute your work as part of their show-reel gives you some additional exposure in markets you may not have had.
