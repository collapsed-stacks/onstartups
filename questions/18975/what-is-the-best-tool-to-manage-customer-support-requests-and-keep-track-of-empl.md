Does anyone have suggestions for a tool to keep track of customer support requests, bugs, and questions?

Recommendations for the best way to keep track of employee time spent on these issues would be greatly appreciated.

Currently we're using ZenDesk which does a good job on managing the requests, but I also need a solution that can keep track of time each employee spends on completing the request.

I just signed up for Harvest. Does anyone know other great programs I should check out for time tracking and invoicing?

<p><a href="http://www.helpspot.com/" rel="nofollow">HelpSpot</a> hands down. And this company kind of competes with mine, but I would still recommend them.  It solves your need way better than a bug tracking tool could. (Jira or FogBugz <em>could</em> work for you, but you wouldn't be using 80% of the features).</p>

<p>I've never used it, but just heard of it today: Zoho Support <a href="http://www.zoho.com/support/" rel="nofollow">www.zoho.com/support/</a></p>

<p>Most of the Zoho suite is pretty nice and their support software includes time tracking.</p>

I find Jira very techy. We use SmarterTrack for our tech support and it is quite good.

I would recommend JIRA project/task management tool Atlassian. Granted not quite as front facing as something like Zen but for a small size company its really cost effect

The costs are here

http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing.jsp, $10 to start with 

I use it all the time, and its a great tool for bug tracking, agile planning, tracking user time. 

The out of the box charts will make it easy for you to track where your guys are spending the time and users can even vote on the fixes then would like to see fixed

Hope this helps

Just bumped into this site the other day.  Looks like they might have a solution - worth a look.
