A lot of websites show off their customer lists (ie: http://www.browserstack.com/) on their homepage as a way to get extra credibility with the potential user.

Before putting the logos/names of companies that use the product, must I get the permission of companies to do so, or can I simply go ahead and do it w/o their knowledge or permission?

If you have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement, you obviously have to ask them.

Even when I have not signed any NDA, I still ask.  
In the case of software, revealing what software a company uses might facilitate spying/hacking, so some companies have very strict internal policies on this, and can get very upset by unsollicited information leaks.

Being able to disclose this information is often negociated in the sales phase, and can justify a discount.
