I've been working part-time as a developer for a startup for the past couple of months for equity, at this point 0.5%.

It's to the point now where we are trying to get a beta out the door in the next couple of months. I'd like to continue working through to get the beta out with a higher time commitment (about 30 hours per week), but am unsure how much time I'll be able to commit after that point.

I've seen questions regarding how much equity is appropriate, but they mostly seem to involve vesting over longer periods of time. Are there any guidelines for giving equity for development over a short-term basis like a couple of months?

I know that's going to vary a lot, but here are some specifics that might help. At this point, we've got a bit of code, but do not yet have a minimum viable product. We also have no customers, and the founder is also technical and would be contributing to development. We have no outside funding at this time.

I was thinking in the neighborhood of 2-2.5% given that the startup is in such an early stage. Is this reasonable, laughable, or somewhere in between?

There are a lot of data points missing from your explanation. What percentage of the coding time for the minimum viable product is yours? What size market is the company going after and what percentage of that market do they expect to capture in say the first year? How competitive is your market and what kind of sales and marketing efforts will be needed to capture that market share?
