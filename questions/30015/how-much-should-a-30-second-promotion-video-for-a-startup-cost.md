I am working on my own small startup.
We're looking to create a 30 seconds teaser. Very simple, which will have some animation, some text recorded on top of it, and maybe some original custom music.

Does anyone have any idea how much something like this might cost? And how much would each part of it be?

Here is one we have used: http://demorocket.com/ at about $1500/minute depending on language, script, degree of artistic rendering necessary.

I am sure you could get 30 seconds for as low as $500 and still have it look and feel professionally rendered. As with anything you get what you pay for.

I have used http://demogirl.com/ before to create promotional videos about web applications, the price was originally $99 but looks like they have increased it to $199

If you want one of the top explainer/promo video companies I would plan on spending anywhere between $3k - $10k. This includes script creation. Pricing is usually based per 60 seconds so a 30 second video may cost you less. 

You can find a list of some of the top explainer video producers here:

Yeah, it could range from uber cheap... You may be able to get it done for a couple thousand all the way up to millions depending on the quality and who makes it.

Yes it's a very, very wide range.

It will also depend on what the use of the video is for. TV, Cinema, website etc.

If you're looking at a do it yourself job, it can get even cheaper.

"How long is a piece of string?" You could spend millions on it or you could spend 5 bucks.

Seriously, I got a video made for my company from here for $5:
