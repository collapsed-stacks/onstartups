What is the best marketing channel to distribute an ebook?
Let's assume I know how to promote the ebook, and merely want to choose a marketing channel.

Should I sell it through a middleman like Amazon or Lulu? Or should I sell it directly through a site I set up myself? What are the factors that go into this decision? In particular, if I have an ebook of broad interest, not niche, which marketing channel is preferred and why?

I believe it depends on the content itself.

If the content is a $19.99 "101 ways to improve your SEO and make $1 million dollars while sleeping on the beach" book I think one would do better by selling the PDF directly through their site. That way, control of the pitch & close statements can be strongly managed to encourage conversations.  Also, affliate sales can be tracked / incorporated into the sales process - something that would be difficult via lulu / amazon.

If the book is more mainstream, then its a platform bet - Lulu with it's apple epub support and amazon with kindle.  Pick both if you can.
