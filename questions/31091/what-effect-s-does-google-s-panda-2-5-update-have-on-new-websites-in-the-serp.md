I recently launched 3 websites (within the past 7-10 months) that had been steadily increasing in the rankings on Google search up until this past weekend, when I noticed a huge drop across most of my tracked keywords. The 3 websites are e-commerce sites. This drop coincided with the exact date and time (September 28) of Google's update to its infamous Panda update, Panda 2.5. I am wondering what the implications might be for new websites like mine with Panda 2.5. What is this most recent algorithm change targeting? Duplicate content, poor content, bad URLs?

 Any new information on this would be of help.

My feeling is you just have to ride this thing out.  I believe Google is trying to make their search results better and you will see a lot of shifting around.  I have noticed on my sites that it is the long tail and highly competitive search results that are shifting each time Google does an update.

<p>Here's a helpful article on <a href="http://searchengineland.com/impacted-by-googles-panda-update-google-asks-you-to-consider-this-76050" rel="nofollow">questions Google wants you to consider regarding the Panda updates and impact on your sites</a>. While it dates from May, I understand that Google's focus remains the same with the additional Panda updates</p>
