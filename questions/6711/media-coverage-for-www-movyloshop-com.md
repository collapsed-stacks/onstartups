<p>"Imagine you're trying to launch a new software product, book, web service, church, small business, social cause, consulting practice, school, podcast channel, rock band, whatever...The most important skill today is... teaching."</p>

<p>Go spend that time teaching people. Not teaching them about your product, but teaching them how to be smarter and better. </p>

+1000 to Nathan.

In addition to Nathans answers, the key is to be interesting or noteworthy in some way.

Maybe the founders have an interesting story?  (Balsamiq)
Maybe the company have an interesting philosophy?  (Fog Creek)
Maybe the product is different or special in someway?  (37Signals)
Maybe the attitude to delivery is interesting?  (Zappos)

I want to put all of these into place, not necessarily to gain PR, just because I think they will genuinely lead to a better company.  

I would also go out and contact with bloggers etc on a personal level to tell them about all of the above.
