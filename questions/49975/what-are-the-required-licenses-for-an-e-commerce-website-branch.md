<p>Well first of all, why are you starting a branch to trade across US. His main site can do that, are referring more to operating a part of his business in the US, i.e. shipping, etc<br>
Basically what you would require licensing wise is<br>
A. Business Registration with the state - LLc, corp, etc Pick a state friendly with their tax laws for your business<br>
B. Tax Registration - Federal and State. EIN Number which Federal Gov will give you will need to be used on ALL business accounts.<br>
Beyond that you should be good. If you open warehouses, manufacturing facilities, sell certain products, etc there may be more, but the 2 above are basics for every business.<br>
If you go to corporate affairs page of your state government they will likely have info specific to the state which will help</p>
