For example, say I form my LLC in Delaware and then decide several months down the road or maybe even a couple years down the road that I want to change the state to Florida and form my LLC in Florida (this is a hypothetical).  

1. Is this allowed?  
2. What are the legal requirements to so?
3. Are there any penalties involved? 
4. Do I run the risk of losing my business name, etc.?

1. Yes.  Most definitely.

2. Vary from state to state.  You will need to visit the Secretary of State website to determine the ones for state of Florida.

3. There will definitely be fees.  Nothing is done for free.

4. May be.  Again you will need to look at Requirements for your state and possibly talk with a lawyer about it.

For more information there are many websites listing information on how to do it.  [This is one of them](http://www.ehow.com/how_7264850_change-state-incorporation.html)
