I am starting a travel business with an agency model. We will make tours and activities bookable online and will take a commission on each booking.

If you look at a site like [Airbnb][1] or [Vayable][2] to name but two of 1000s of travel sites. How do you think they can send payments around the world affordably?

For example, if you book a tour for two people in Paris, it might cost US$100. You pay this US$100 on the agent's site. The agent might take 15-20% commission, and so must send US$80-85 to the tour guide in Paris. 

My bank would charge around US$20 for this international payment, which wipes out the margin.

Is there a way of sending international payments from bank account to bank account that I am not aware of? I know [PayPal][3] can do this, but I would prefer to pay money directly in to a bank account.

What I would do is setup an escrow system using an online escrow provider. You can place the money for your vendors into this system so that they can see that they will get paid. As Steve points out you can make a minimum payment amount to make transfer fees not hurt so much. Perhaps also make terms that they only get paid once the client checks into the tour so that your not on the hook for cancellations.
