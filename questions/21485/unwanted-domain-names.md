What is the best thing to do with an unwanted domain name?

I bought playlistdesigner.co.uk about 2 years ago with the idea of making a website. Nowadays i just havent got the time to give it my full attention.

What is the best thing to do with it? Sell it? Keep it?

Thanks

Either put it for sale (on sedo or other place), or simply release it, so that whoever cares can grab it.

You could donate it. I've never done it myself, but here are some options:

A recent post on the Boston Ruby Group list recommended this:

I like the idea of donating. 

You can also sell domain names through broker websites such as sedo.com. Do your research on the service you choose first though. You may find that you have the name listed for quite a long time before it sells.

<p><a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/21485/unwanted-domain-names/21488#21488">Donation</a> is a nice idea. However you may want to delay your decision just in case. The only thing you will face pay the domain renewal fee.</p>

<p>I recently discovered <a href="http://www.google.com/domainpark/" rel="nofollow"><strong>AdSense for Domains</strong></a>. I put about a dozen domains I had there, and they are generating enough revenue to pay all the domain I registered.</p>

This comes up frequently on Hacker News. People have been giving domain names 'free to a good home'. You should check it out.
