We regularly have some distributors who pay us from outside the US.  That usually costs 2% or so at their end and another $25 or more at our end.

Is there a cheaper way to do that? Maybe with PayPal?

In most countries they can go to their bank and order a check, drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars. *(Make sure to stress that point. This ensures the check is MICR encoded. If it is not MICR encoded you will pay a collection fee.)* This is generally less expensive than an international wire transfer to the US.
