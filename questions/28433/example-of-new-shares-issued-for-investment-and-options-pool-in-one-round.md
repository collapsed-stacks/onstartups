Please check my thinking.

*  Right now, founders own 100% of 1000 shares.
*  We're willing to sell 30% of the company to outside investors.
*  We want to set aside another 10% for an employee options pool.

I think this all means we need to issue 666 new shares, and put 500 up for sale, and put 166 in the options pool. Is this right?

<p>If your investors have agreed 30% based on the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Post-money_valuation" rel="nofollow"><em>post-money</em> valuation</a>, and a 10% post-money options pool, then your example is correct. Or, to be entirely accurate:</p>

<ul>
<li>The investors would have 500/(1000+666) = 30.01%</li>
<li>The options pool 166/(1000+666) = 9.96%</li>
<li>All founders combined 1000/(1000+666) = 60.02%</li>
</ul>

<p>(Percentage values rounded off to two decimals.)</p>

<p>However, this blindly assumes that you already have negotiated this result, or are in a position to actually negotiate this. There are other points that need to be settled, see for example the Venture Hacks article "<a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle" rel="nofollow">The Option Pool Shuffle</a>". I assume you meant the question as a hypothetical example, just to see a basic math example of issuing new shares.</p>
