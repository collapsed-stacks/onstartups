As per @Zuly Gonzalez' answer to this question on "[Non .com domain v hyphen domain][1]", when choosing a domain name sometimes it is necessary to add a common suffix to the name. Eg. mydomainAPP.com.  

For enterprise software, I dont think *app* works the best...  
So which suffixes would be better / more professional sounding / not-bozo-sounding / specific enough to have a meaning / and yet still flexible enough to not lock me down in the future? 

- Technology
- Enterprise 
- Solutions 
- Application
- Software
- Systems
- Products
- Something else....?

I think it depends on what your product does, and who your market is. 

For the high-tech market, I like 'Technology' and 'Software'. Both are very generic, and will let you expand into other areas, like software support services.

'Systems' is also good, but to me implies something big, like a system that is made up of parts. For example a piece of hardware that comes with software, or several software components that work together. 

The term 'Solutions' makes me think you are offering a service to the customer, such as a consulting firm.

'Enterprise' sounds a bit stuffy to me.

I don't like 'Application' or 'Products'. Plus, they may be too specific (especially 'Application'), and could limit you in the future. These terms may imply that you only provide a product, but you may decide you want to provide support for your software.

If I had to pick one for an enterprise software company, I would go with **Software**.

From the list above: **systems** 

Enterprise-size businesses deploy systems and operate based on processes. :)
