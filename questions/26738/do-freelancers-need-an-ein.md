I do freelance programming and one of my recent projects, the client mentioned he would need an EIN for the 1099, but could use my SSN if I didn't want to apply for one. Besides the protecting of not giving out my SSN, is there any need for an EIN as a freelancer?

<p>The EIN doesn't give you any special benefits, other than the privacy of the SSN that you mentioned.  But it's so easy to get, there's no reason not to take the 5 minutes to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=102767,00.html" rel="nofollow">apply for one</a>.</p>
