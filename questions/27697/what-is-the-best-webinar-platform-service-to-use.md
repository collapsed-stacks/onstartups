I am likely to launch a webinar series with some partner companies that is targeted at individuals. Initially we might be as small as 50 - 100 attendees at first but it has the potential to be hundreds and even thousands over time. I'd like to be as economical as possible at first. Don't want to buy an enterprise solution and run myself. Want to be very economical. Capabilities needed: show PPT, attendees ask questions...at some point would like to be able to poll the audience and more. But pretty simple.

I've looked at GoToWebinar which is $499/month for up to 1,000 attendees but you can't go beyond that. Am just starting to research beyond that.

Any recommendations?

Tx Chris

Webinars are much more than just presenting information to people. If you are using this to market your business, company, product then you need a service that allows or works with a booking system that takes contact details (email at the minimum). Those details are gold for your marketing.  I use GoToMeeting because they have the booking system built in with full reporting suite of all details capture, who actually joined the conference etc. Look for a service that has those capabilities up front

You have probably already researched gotomeeting.com / webex etc.  and they get expensive with lots of attendees.  You might look at a different approach and do something like Ustream? 

Wouldn't have as intimate of a feel and you wouldn't really know who was logged in watching, but would support more viewers I think.

Pretty good question!

Probably you want to take a look at this:
http://www.openmeetings.de/Features/

OpenMeetings has meanwhile arrived at the Apache Software Foundation (before a couple of days). The Software is fully functional and can be installed on your server. As it is Open Source, there is no license you need to buy, but you can (if you wish) rent a hosted instance.
