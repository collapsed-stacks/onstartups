I had internal agreement with my partner for one the portal. My contribution was portal development while his contribution was sales and company formation.

It's been 1.5 years and still he couldn't do one single sale due to lack of sales skills. So I decided to dissolve my partnership and move on.

As per our contract, each partner should get code copy. I'm ready to give him code, in return if he sign the dissolution agreement. My partner is not agreeing to do that as he wants full control over domain and hosting as well, which I can't afford that.

I'd like to know if I ignore our partnership agreement and bring investor in company, will he have rights in future to make legal issue of that? Our contract is not bind with government

Walk away with nothing but your copy of the code, as you agreed.

You can easily set up again on your own, or with different partner(s).

Why? Sure? He can not sue? How comes you think that? What country?

Generally - yes, you are stuck here.
