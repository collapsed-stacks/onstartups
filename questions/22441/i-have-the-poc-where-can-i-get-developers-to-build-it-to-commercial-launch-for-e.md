I have built the Proof Of Concept for my web app idea, and it's great although a few aspects need to be added.
However our budget is completely out.

We have been looking for a development team who can flesh out the POC up to a Beta or even commercial launch.
the problem is that good quality developers don't seem to be interested in equity payment and we still need to smoothen out the POC before I can take it on the road to look for investors.

My question now is: How and where can I attract good quality developers (preferably ROR) to come in as partners to finalize this project.

To describe the project I would say it's a Social Networking application.

For starters, I would say tone down your pitch a bit.  A "Social Networking Tsunami"?  The more you hype it, the less plausible it sounds.  Just tell people you're working on a social app that has strong potential.

Maybe before people suggest to you how/where to find developers you add some comments on what exactly you think is fair in terms of equity.  What are you expecting?  A team member? A contract developer?  A CxO?

The problem you are up against is that any halfway decent developer comes across offers like yours 10 times a month.  The reason people don't get too excited about equity payment is because they can't *do* anything with it.  You can't pay your mortgage or buy groceries with equity in some unknown startup, and many good developers are somewhat averse to working for free.

> the problem is that good quality developers don't seem to be interested in equity 

And that is probably a couple of percent. So, you look for idiots that are smart developers. Won't happen. 90% of the startups fail. Good developers either have their own projects, or work as freelancers for $$$$, or both. What can you offer? The chance for some money down the line?

The main problem is that you need to find someone who does not take the $10,000 - $20,000 he can earn per month (possibly more, depending on the field) for the chance of having a small percentage some point down the line. Won't work, statistically and financially. Why should such a person invest into you? What makes you different from all the others?

BAD developers find a market. GOOD developers can freely select whom they work for.

good devs will not be interested in the lowish (1-10%) equity percentage that startup founders with no previous track record and no revenue will usually offer. You need a 50% partner who can code and manage the tech stack, while you manage marketing, sales and investor relations.

The problem with developers is they tend to be risk averse, you're unlikely to find such a developer. Also, if you're offering something like 5-10% equity (even worse over several devs), you need to remember who needs who more.

If the idea is that good then you should be able to convince an angle investor with your business plan and alpha application and use that funding to get the product to beta, to market and another funding round.

I have to agree with NetTecture here. You have to make your proposition attractive maybe with a combination of compensation and equity if you really want to get good developers.

Great, experienced software developers who are high risk takers want to create their own startups
or else be true cofounders with a share equal to yours in equity.  Great developers with a medium
tolerance for risk go to work for vc backed startups or startups that at least have a large angel seed round.
There are two groups of developers who might be interested in your proposal: young people straight out of 
college who want startup experience and average devs who might be decent coders but know they lack the skills
to take a concept and turn it into a product without supervision.

No development teams that I know of is  sitting around waiting for good ideas. They have plenty. Our development team has a sandbox of personal projects that they would love to work on. The challenge is finding a team that has the capacity , desire, interest to take your project on as a speculative venture. 

I will tell you what our team considers when we are considering taking on a client that isn't going to pay cash to cover our bills but has dazzled us with promises of equity: 

1. Is this something that we know. Have we done it before. Is there something we can change/adapt/configure to get us there faster?
2. Do we have a client right now that would pay for this if we offered them the vapor ware on a great deal?
3. Is the prospective client for this solution overlap the client base of any of our other solutions?
4. What is the cash value of the investment which we would be making -- if we had that cash would we invest it in this start-up? If not-- why is our time worth less than our money, and if so why don't we?

Based on the above criteria I would be looking for development teams that had paying clients that covered their overhead -- not someone who will focus on this until a paying gig comes along. I would focus on someone who has developed in a similar market space. I would focus on someone for whom your business would add value to their existing portfolio.

Something to think about: 

If I was the development team that considered this project this is the question which would be on my mind: 

What is the potential value of this project *without* a developer coming on board? What is the potential value of this project *with* a developer coming on board?

Since it sounds as though the answer to the first question is: nothing. (meaning if the project stays as a POC -- then it isn't generating revenue and isn't really worth anything.) 
And the answer to the second question is: something.

Then the value of the developer to the project is: everything.

A great idea is worth about 5-10%. I think it would be fair to expect to secure the "right" development team  a joint venture where they are in the "everything" range (say 60-70+% ownership) 

And as an "idea guy" that pains me every time I say it. :(

I have writen about this here

http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/22725/programmers-working-for-equity/23010#23010

Yes you can get good developers for equity but you must be realistic espically about the equity.  Recognise that your bringing an idea and they are bringing real tangable software.

Often it depends on the idea and how much work it will take.

I can't seem to add comments so I'll say this about the answer below where the worth is nothing to the developer.  It's not nothing it's just low and speaking as a guy who isn't an ideas man.  I'm not much without ideas.  So a 50 50 split is reasonable.
