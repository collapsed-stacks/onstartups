By VC-targeted, I mean a businessplan that I send to VCs as part of the first contact package..

It concerns a saas/paas startup with a very clearly defined target group. We have preliminary market research results but are not online yet.

Brainstroming and some google research led to these content items:

*channels   
*specific activities in these channels  
*estimated conversion rate through these  
*estimated costs of these measures  


What do you think?


Update:  
We have to write a businessplan as partial requirement for a part government funded investment into our startup. so i figured we might as well make it useful for something more than just appealing to bureaucrats..

Dmitry is correct in that a VC will not read your business plan. What they want to see is:

 - Executive Summary (1-2 pages)
 - Pitch Deck (less than 14 slides)
 - Financial Model (5 years of Pro-forma)

As for content of the marketing section of the pitch, they want to see markets over a billion dollars that you can capture > 10% market share within 3-5 years. The questions that will run through their mind that you need to answer are:

 - **Market Size:** It has to be a huge market (> $1B) or they are not interested
 - **Customer Pain:** Is what you are solving a real customer issue
 - **Customer Traction:** Do you have lead customers that will buy today.
 - **Competitors:** Who out there will directly compete with you
 - **Will this scale:** Scale means can it grow quickly or is it a niche, hard sell.

It's hard to nail all of these but you really need to try. VC's see thousands of deals a year. They pick maybe 200 to pitch. Of those 20 go to due diligence. Out of the 20, 2 get funded. So, you have to stand out as an excellent deal.

I seriously doubt any VC would read a business plan on first contact. Create a pitch deck sticking to the <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule.html">10-slide rule</a>, albeit maybe <a href="http://bizclarity.com/2009/08/15/the-10-slide-rule-is-wrong/">not literally</a>. You may find some decent guides and samples on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?q=vc+pitch+sample">SlideShare</a>.

UPDATE: As you wrote that you absolutely have to have a business plan, check out the <a href="http://www.score.org/template_gallery3.html">SCORE templates</a>.
