I'm building a pitch deck for an internet startup.

I've read other financial projections and pro-formas which have quite irrelevant accounting. Our main expenses are simply server costs -- $95/month including bandwidth, hosting, domain etc. 

Our revenues stem from lead generation advertising as well as other diverse sources. 

What is the best way to show and communicate this on a pitch deck?

Thanks,

I guess a pitch deck is meant for investors. If that is the case, why looking for investors if your costs are 95 per month? That can be easily be paid with 1 evening per week selling burgers at McDonalds...

But answering your question, what I did was putting the funds out/in/needed from a cash flow analysis and what was the cost structure (simple pie graphic showing how much was costing my devs and sales guys, server/hardware, then marketing expenses and others). Of course have in your appendix slides more details or bring your excel files when you are going to discuss the details. In the same slide I also valuated the company and asked the amount needed fyi

You need to re-evaluate your costs.  There is no business that investors will want to invest in that costs $95/mo to operate.  You need to talk staff salaries, marketing, hard costs, etc.  Agreed with Jean-Pierre, why ask for funds if this is all it takes?

If you want investor backing, get serious with your financials.

Good luck!

<p>Consider the following <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/22961/why-do-startups-need-so-much-money">question &amp; responses</a>... its never as cheap as $95 a month - otherwise, everyone would be in business. </p>
