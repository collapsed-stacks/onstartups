Is it possible to start with an LLC to avoid the overhead and convert to a corporation later when there is some visible traction and need for raising funds from outside investors?

<p>Short answer: Yes.</p>

<p>I see that you are here in the Bay Area. The CA Secretary of State provides a <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/corp/pdf/articles/corp%5Farts%5Fconv%5Fllc.pdf" rel="nofollow">form</a> to help you get pointed in the right direction.</p>

<p>You need to know, however, that such a conversion can result in a tax hit (you would need to discuss this issue with your tax advisor) in addition to the direct costs of conversion.</p>

<p>Accordingly, if you anticipate conversion, you should think about whether it might be better to form a corporation in the first place.

Spending the time to figure out if it makes sense to set up a LLC or S Corp up front is great advice.

A LLC is much easier to set up than a S Corp and many people do so without a lawyer. 

However, for a S Corp using a lawyer to help with the articles of incorporation and the annual meeting minutes, etc is best.  Thus the overhead and filing requirements are more for a S Corp.

I am not sure what "overhead" you think you will avoid with an LLC as opposed to an S corp/

IMO it is not worth the hassle later.  

If you plan on being a corp, be a corp.

"start with an LLC to avoid the overhead" I'm confused, what overhead? In certain states, LLC's have publication requirements and annual fees that far exceed that of a corporation. Sure, a Corp has certain administrative requirements (like electing officers, keeping meeting minutes, adopting bylaws) but any good Accountant or Corporate Attorney should be able to help you automate most of the busy-work. 

If you think you'll ever want investors, you will probably want a C-Corp in a state with good case law like Delaware or Nevada. I'd say either find a good attorney who can work with you on their fees, or sign up for a cost-effective Pre-Paid Legal plan to get phone consultations with one to help advise you properly.

I think the major overhead if I am correct is having to pay self employment tax versus paying payroll tax.  I thing setting up payroll tax might be tougher.  When I went through the process myself I choose LLC mainly for the reason that paying self employment tax is simple.  Payroll tax seems as if you have to set up a formalized payroll process for which you may need an outside vendor like ADP.  Again this is what I picked up from reading online.  I would love to hear what more experienced entrepreneurs think.

The cost of legal fees and risk of tax implications isn't worth it. Trust me, I just tried the reverse, to convert a Corp to an LLC, finally giving up and starting a new company.

Just decide what you want to be and stick with it.

If you plan on raising money someday just setup a Corporation, if you never intend on having other owners I'd stick with an LLC...but definately hire a lawyer even for an LLC...as without the proper operating agreement you are essentially a sole proprietor (vulnerable). Best $700 you could spend.
