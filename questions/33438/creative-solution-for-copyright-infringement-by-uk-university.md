This question is sort of a follow up to:

 - [Creating non-profit startup from open-source software project][1]
 - [Selling using the honor system][2]

Basically, I'm selling software on the honor system for $5 to individuals and $999 to large entities.  This doesn't work and I will be changing this, but that isn't the point of this question.

A very well known university in the UK is using my software for its student government elections and paid only the $5 price.  I've sent them emails and spoken on the phone with the bursar, and they refuse to do anything.

I know what the legal solutions are (I'm an attorney), but since I am in the US and it is only $999, it probably doesn't make sense financially to hire a UK lawyer to address this.

I'm looking for creative non-legal solutions.  I don't know much about the UK and universities there.  Anything I can do to shame/embarrass the university into paying the remaining amount owed?  For example, is there a public/government agency or a copyright enforcement group that might be interested?

I would do three things:

1. After the initial cease-desist letters to the legal department of the university for violation of the software license -- let it go. Don't spend any more karmic energy on trying to collect.

2. With the help of someone at the University right a "Case Study" of how the software is being used and the impact. See if you can get a Political Science professor or graduate student at the University to co-write the article with you. Name the Univeristy by name. Do not make it anonymous. (If they contact you to complain reference your letter where they are violating the license of the software) 

3. Write a guest post on an appropriate blog about your experience with making the software available,, and include in that experience the specific name of the University failing to use the proper license.  It would be great if the blog happened to be in the UK.

And with a little linking, posting and support on your site of the "Case Study" and the "Guest Blog Post" you will get $999 of earned media out of their name-- and you can call it even.

You could contact the student government entity and ask them to address the problem.  I would ask nicely in the initial email and go from there. They may be able to talk to the bursar.
