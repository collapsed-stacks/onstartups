I have a website which receives over half of its traffic from non-English speaking countries and websites. However, I only have Google Adsense and (from what I know) it only displays advertisements in English. How can I get the advertisements that appear on my website to be targeted to the specific language of the viewer?

Google shows localized ads in other languages... you won't see them when you visit the site, but your visitors in other countries will.
