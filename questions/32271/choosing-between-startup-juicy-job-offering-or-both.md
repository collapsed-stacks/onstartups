I'm kind of in the dilemma of choosing between continuing with my startup or accepting a very well paid and intellectually motivating job offering from a multinational company who just opened a local office.

Tricky thing is, the job offering comes from a new client of ours who was particularly impressed with me. Its a big, big client, and the position is, well, I couldn't ask for more (top technical position in the local office), and it even looks like a place where I could make a life-long career (but nothing like having your own company).

OTOH, my partners, well, I couldn't ask for better partners, they are skilled and trustworthy, but our future as a company is not as certain as this job (or, either, has had very slow progress).

I was also considering on taking the job and working on my company in my free time (might not be a problem as far as conflict of interests goes, the work wouldn't be that much releated), and maybe get a couple of people to compensate the gap I leave. OTOH, staying could keep the interest of this client latent in our company and even sweeten/make-possible future deals, but that is even less certain.

Only one thing is for sure, I'm not leaving my startup completely, but I'm worried stuff might fall apart without me there.

What would you do? What would be your criteria to choose or formulate an additional option? If you've gone through a similar experience, what was the outcome?

**Be realistic and work hard towards something.**

It is definitely hard to juggle a venture while pursuing another job. The last thing you want to do is both things poorly.

You should consider where you want to go in the future. If the job is doing something you love doing, it's worth considering.

As far as the startup, you need to evaluate if it is a realistic venture. How long have you been pursuing it? What's the outlook for the startup?


Ultimately you need to evaluate if entrepreneurship is the right path for you. Consider this quote from our friend, Steve.

>“I hate it when people call themselves ‘entrepreneurs’ when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup, so they can cash in and move on. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business.” -Steve Jobs

A lot of people treat start-ups like a get-rich-quick-scheme. Building a business is hard work and may not pay off for a long time.

If you've got business partners who're both skilled and share your vision, don't worry too much - you'll learn how to make money eventually, until you have serious financial problems in life. 

If the client offer is too tempting, you could always tell him that you're continuing with your startup for a few months and would like to make a decision later.
