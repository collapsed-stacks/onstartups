Recently, I started a jewelry business. I have a name, the product, a shopping cart,a blog, and a facebook page. However, I would like to know how do I secure this name to make sure that nobody else copies it? How do I make a legal association between the name and the product?

<p>The best way to protect your name is to trademark it. You can <a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&amp;state=4006%3aquim1l.1.1" rel="nofollow">check if the name has already been trademarked</a>.  </p>

<p>The Nolo website has good, easy to understand information on <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/trademark-law/" rel="nofollow">trademarks</a>, including <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-do-trademark-search-29741.html" rel="nofollow">how to do a trademark search</a>, <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/faqEditorial-29129.html" rel="nofollow">qualifying for trademark protection</a>, and <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/article-29902.html" rel="nofollow">enforcing your trademark rights</a>. I would familiarize myself with this information before proceeding. The <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> also has information. Also check out other <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/search?q=trademark">questions and answers</a> from this site relating to trademarks.</p>

<p>Be aware that trademarks are only valid in the country you get them in. So if you get a trademark in the US, someone in the UK can use your name without any penalties. And it can be an expensive undertaking if you do find someone in the US using your trademark.</p>

In the U S, I did this:

1. Filed assumed name papers in my state. It's quick and cheap and secures your use of that name locally. Also makes it possible to deposit checks made out to the company name.
2. Applied for a trademark in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO.gov). This takes a long time and costs a lot, and requires periodic filings to keep it in force. This secures your name for your product category.  You can do this without a lawyer. Expect to be denied the first time for what looks like spurious reasons. Just respond to their comments.  

You can search the USPTO site to see if your name is already being used for jewelry, and for other useful information.

<p>You should register your trademark. Please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/10/12/trademark-protection-in-once-easy-lesson/" rel="nofollow">Trademark Protection in One Easy Lesson</a> for an overview of how registration works.</p>

visit the United States Patent and Trademark office www.uspto.gov. There you will be able to apply for a trademark. 

Be careful to do a detailed search first and make sure nothing similar to your name is already trademarked or you will waste money on your application fee. A common mistake is that people often will try to trademark a word or phrase which contains additional words to an already trademarked word of phrase.

When applying I would also be careful to note that jewelry, watches, and fashion accessories like bags, wallets, etc..  are all in different categories so you will have to pay a fee and conduct a search for each category that you are applying for a trademark in.
