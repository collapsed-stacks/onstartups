I am  developing Twitter Based CRM system. I am in very early stage of development ( http://www.tweetalley.com ) and looking for some feedback. It is hard to get feedback from person who never used Twitter. How to find twitter user data so that I can contact them to get some feedback? Please help!

<p>Since this is CRM, the user data you need are for companies who heavily interact with customers via Twitter. That's a different perspective of the usage of Twitter than what individuals may be doing.</p>
