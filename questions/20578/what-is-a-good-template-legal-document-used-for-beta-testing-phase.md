Is there any legal documents or agreements that I need to show to my beta testers? Basically cover things like, they won't decompile it, that I am not responsible for any damage etc.

I don't really want to hire a lawyer at the moment...as I am still in need of further beta testing before launching.

Here are some freely available beta tester agreement forms:

 - http://www.docstoc.com/docs/40142261/Beta-Test-Agreement
 - http://resources.lawinfo.com/letters/popups/betatest.html

Most of these forms from initial glance are all generally pretty similar, but will most definitely help you.
