For options, you should take a look at the HMRC site for Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) - that's the most tax-efficient way to do employee options. You should probably use an accountant to set them up, it will cost Â£2,000 or so but it's not really something you can safely do yourself.

Issuing shares is easy, I don't know about preferred stock but can't think of any reason it would be difficult.

Public companies are pretty much invariably  PLCs,  I can't think of any exceptions offhand. However, if and when it gets to that stage then there will be specialists who can take you through the process of converting from a Limited company to a PLC. There's no value that I can think of in starting off as a PLC, and many disadvantages (more paperwork etc.).
