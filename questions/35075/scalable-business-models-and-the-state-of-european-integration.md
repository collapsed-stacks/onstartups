I have heard that there is lot has been done to make the European market tightly integrated (universal regulations across European Union, etc).

So, I wonder if it is easier now to create a scalable business and scale it all over European market.

I address my question to entrepreneurs who have run their business in Europe: Does it really matter from what European country your business is, if you work all over the European Union?

Is there just language/translation issues when working on local European markets or anything else?

For example, what obstacles (except language) can a Spanish company face in France? Local laws and regulations? Payments and banks? Anything else?


Have you ever met an issue when, for example, German customers tried to buy from German companies only in a certain market segment?

I would list the following (some of those you touched on already):

 * Language
 * Currency (not all EU countries use the Euro)
 * Laws and Regulations (The EU creates *directives* which each member state implements, some times differently)
 * Tax - anything from corporation tax, Value Added Tax, to social and health insurance. Each country has a different system and different set of tax laws.
 * Banks and payments - this is actually improving gradually, but there are still obstacles, e.g. opening a bank account in a different country.
 * Intellectual Property (a subset of Laws and Regulations I suppose, but important to startups), e.g. copyright "ownership" is treated differently to some extent, registration of trademarks and so on
 * Public acceptance / psychology - customers might prefer products or services from their own or more 'friendly' countries
