I volunteer with a neighborhood group and wanted to know your thoughts on startup management, motivation, organization, etc. techniques that I can apply to all volunteer organizations. It seems that an all volunteer group can learn a lot from startups.

It’s important in a volunteer group and a start up to have:

 - A clear purpose of the organization.
 - Defined roles, responsibilities and organizational structure of the membership.
 - Clearly defined goals and the means to accomplish them.
 - Open communication within reason where everyone is heard and feel they are able to voice their ideas, opinions and concerns.

Since a volunteer organization is made up of people volunteering their time for free, for members to continue long term they need to feel valued, appreciated and what they are doing is worthwhile.  I believe in a volunteer group which is a little different from a start up business, the leadership needs to be inclusive.   The volunteer leaders need to find the best way to appreciate and express gratitude and accept ALLcontributions of help and support to the organization while gracefully directing that help and support so they fit into the organization’s purpose and goals.
