Myself and two other partners are planning to start a C-Corporation. One of the partners is on H1B visa sponsored by his employer and he is getting a W2 from them. We have few questions:

1. Can a person on H1B Visa with a W2 be a founder/Owner of a C-Corporation

2. If answer is no to # 1, then what are his options. Is there such thing as passive investor? And how can we allocate him share of the company as a passive investor?

3. If he becomes a passive investor, does that mean he has to buy his part of the shares? And if we sell him share at lower value (example: 1cent per share) does that lower the valuation of our company?

4. Are there any tax liabilities in case we have to close the C-Corporation?

Visa's give permission to be in a country and can enable someone to work.  They do not impact if someone owns something or not.  So he can own but he might not be able to work for this company.  (Would need to read the visa and get an attorney's oppinion.)  When he is in his own country though he can work and own (save for countries that are being embargoed like Iran).  

Valuation would be decreased if he gets shares at a discounted price.

For question 4 not following for whom would there be tax liabilities that you are asking about?

<p>The H-1B holder can be a founder / owner of another company.</p>

<p>If he wants to work for the other company, he may be able to obtain a concurrent H-1B visa if there is a valid employment relationship. Please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/05/06/can-i-get-an-h-1b-visa-working-for-my-own-company/" rel="nofollow">Can I Get an H-1B Visa Working for My Own Company?</a>.</p>
