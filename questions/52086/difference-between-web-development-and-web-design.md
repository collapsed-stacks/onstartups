<p>Simply put, web development is making a web page -- both coding and designing. Web design, as the name implies, focuses more on the design aspect. This would mean that a web designer relies heavily on tools like Adobe's Dreamweaver and Edge. Nowadays, with the advanced tools that we have, more people that create web pages are designing rather than coding.</p>

<p>Web design is a part of web development, but not necessarily the other way around. </p>
