Has anyone used the online payroll system called "SurePayroll"?  If so what were the pros and cons? Please tell the good, bad, and the ugly.

<p>I'll say up front that I am biased because we have a partner relationship with SurePayroll and <a href="http://www.redcort.com/payroll/payroll-services-and-payroll-software.html" rel="nofollow">offer discount small business payroll pricing through SurePayroll</a> on our web site.  But this is only because I think they are easily the best online payroll processing company out there.</p>

<p>We sell and support Virtual TimeClock software that integrates with a number of leading payroll companies. We have a lot of contact with payroll providers as well as regular discussions with our customers about their payroll needs.  SurePayroll has really won us over with their outstanding customer service and competitive pricing.</p>
