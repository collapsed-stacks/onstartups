Do you agree? Should product price lists be on the website?

Note that I'm referring to relatively expensive purchases (thousands of $ after all users/options purchased), as opposed to like a one-off $29.95 texteditor or something.

<p>If the thing you're selling is undefined ("complex solutions"), then of course you can't price it.  By definition?</p>

<p>But if you're selling software, there's some good reasons to post prices, the biggest of which is that you have a strong negotiating position, in that you don't negotiate.</p>

<p>"We need a discount" can be countered with "All our customers pay the same," which is only a credible statement if you publish your prices.  And <em>all</em> big customers will ask for discounts.</p>

<p>Here's more about the "<a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/discount-gambit.html" rel="nofollow">discount gambit</a>" and more reasons for having fixed, published pricing.</p>

When I'm looking for a solution/product to buy I ran away from websites without pricing.

If someone writes "**contact us for pricing**" that reads "**contact us so we can rob you**". 

  * If you are rich we can charge you a lot, sell you stuff you don't need.
  * If you are poor, we can still get something out of you 

It's going to be either too expensive or tricky, but always dirty.

When it comes to the solutions require custom packages, different modules, different requirements put a **sample case study with pricing** so I can predict the cost before your crazy salesman steal 30 minutes of my precious life for something I won't buy with that price tag.

Not listing the price is doing the perfect market segmentation, charging as much as the customer willing to pay. Yet it's so dirty almost all customers in the world hate it.

*Self answering because my opinion is different than the question.*

For many years, I wholeheartedly agreed with this: not listing the price is simply a way for *some salesman* to harass me into a price. Thank you but no thank you, next!

But I've since changed my mind on this. We do not, and will not, list prices for our products or services. The reason is simple: we do not sell a commodity, but instead complex and customized packages. And, since we can work with customers that range from 2 to 20,000+ employees, our packages cannot be one-size-fits-all.

While anything can of course be broken down to "per user costs" (software) or "per mili impressions" (advertising), it's different for everyone based on the options, modules, targeting, etc. I think it would be a disservice to clients to start the conversation with prices, since we can't know what they'll be without assessing their needs. In fact, we don't even know if our product/service will even be a good fit without knowing what they need, and we certainly don't want to sell to those who don't need.

It's not about *How Much Money Do You Have?* but *How Can We Work Together To Deliver Maximum Value?*

My 2 cents: if you are in B2B don't publish your price on your web site.
You keep a way to negociate prices in each case; the best price is the price that reflects the use value of a service, which will be always different from different customers.

Several questions for consideration:  

1. How expensive is your product?  For low-cost products the choice to post prices is obvious.

2. How many customers do you have or are planning to have?  The more customers, the more difficult it is to maintain different pricing schedules for every customer as well as implement service price increases.

3. Is your competition posting their prices?  You may want to either set yourself apart or follow the industry convention.

4. How good a negotiator are you and your staff?  "Call for price" sends a clear signal that anything you quote will be negotiable.

Our product follows the "software as a service" model with a tiered pricing schedule.  The monthly cost ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per month.  I decided to make our pricing public because I think our fees are very reasonable and because personally I almost never "call for price."

I have a price list that is going to be published on my website and is already given away to anybody who wants it. So I'm all for open pricing.

Note that I favor open pricing although my product tends to fall in the salesman-calls-you kind of category, in that is not commodity software, mainly targets large enterprise customers and may involve customization.

My most important reason for this is that I don't have a salesman to call and negotiate, to begin with, and am not too good at negotiating myself. Second, there's small and medium businesses who are a potentially large audience for my product (I haven't had time to find out, yet) that I find it hard to market directly to, but who I don't want to put off by looking too enterprisey, either.

Finally, I'm already quite happy with my approach to segmentation, which is having diferent editions of my product that are equal in features but vary in capacity. I feel that I can comfortably target different types of companies without having to give myself a headache about charging everybody differently.

I use free customization and extra services as negotiation mass with large customers.

If the product is concrete (i.e. you're delivering the same product to each customer), then I believe the pricing should be public on the website.

As a consumer, it really pisses me off if a company hides their pricing. It says to me "*your time is not important - we'll decide when to give you the information you're looking for*". What I say to them is "*Well, I'm not clicking your contact button, I'm off to your competitor*".

Of course the company has no idea this is happening. Here's the way to measure it - have a 'Pricing' link that takes people to your 'Contact Us' form. See how many people abandon your site from that page.

For off the shelf products I display the actual $ pricing. For enterprise products I display the pricing model (onetime fee and/or seat licenses and/or support, renewals, etc.) without displaying any $ info.

For out-of-the-box/ commodity products, it is probably ok to list the prices on your website.  So for packaged software, yes. But anything that is custom-made whether software customisation or custom research/ analysis, I do not think it is wise to list prices on the website. Similarly you may not want to charge early stage firms (or non-profits) the same as you charge well-established firms so listing prices publicly may cause confusion. Mainly because cost of transacting business with the latter is much greater (think of the time spent in contract negotiations, also longer invoice-to-monies-paid where larger businesses typically impose tougher conditions than smaller ones do). Also if you wish to extend a relationship-building opening gambit type special price to a prospect, then a publicly listed price may or may not help you. The upside could be they can see you gave then 95% discount and are keen to do businessl the downside is that the same discount can make you look very desperate so expect more negotiation on price. Thanks.

If its a commodity product please provide pricing as it will help the rest of us make a decision quicker.

However software that can require custom tailoring can be done via a contact form.

If you have an off-the-shelf product, it's usually good practice to publish your pricing. If your product is customized for each customer, or there are many options to consider, it's often best to have your sales team walk prospective customers through the process.

In certain industries, there are other factors at work. If your company regularly competes for government contracts in a bidding process, you won't publish your prices. After all, you'd let your competition know the price they have to beat.
