I've narrowed our list of vendors for managing our subscription billing down to Spreedly.com and CheddarGetter.com.

I'd love to hear from customers what their experience with https://cheddargetter.com/

Our criteria include:

  *  MultiCurrency Support (billing in various difference currencies). (Which they do)
  *  Ease of use for the End User (I'm evaluating this right now)
  *  Ease of integration with our website.
  *  Reporting (this looks pretty good).
  *  General dependability and support.

We haven't launched yet, but I have found their APIs are very easy to work with and their support very responsive.
