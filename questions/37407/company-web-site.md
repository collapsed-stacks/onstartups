We are building up a new Digital Agency and we are creating our company web site. Because we have just started we don't have any clients in "Our-Portfolio" section nor relevant works that we have committed. We all have lot of experience in Software Development and we have worked in some of the biggest clients in UK as contractor. Can we use the names of the clients were we had worked in the past in our company Portfolio? What's the best thing to do to make clients trust our company even if we have just started?

<p>Another interesting strategy is to build an engaging website that has everything except a portfolio: about us, contact, blog, etc. This might work especially well if you are focused on design and development.</p>

<p>For example, check out the Website of this digital agency in Oslo called <a href="http://unfold.no/" rel="nofollow">Unfold</a>. It really demonstrates their design sensibility and technological capabilities without even having a portfolio. Maybe that's all you need.</p>

<p>If your focus is marketing, I bet there are creative things you could do with your new site that show/sell your philosophy—i.e. put it into practice—without having to showcase any client work yet.</p>

You should check your contracts to see if you are allowed to mention the assignments to anyone. Some organisations won't let you even tell anyone you worked for them.

In any case, you should ask your previous clients for permission, as then you'll know how happy they are, or not.

As for building a portfolio, why not contact a load of local charities, etc and offer to work for nothing, in exchange for a link.

Hmpf. A little naive?

> biggest clients in UK as contractor

So, as self employed consultants runing your own business you have been having a lot of clients.

> we don't have any clients in "Our-Portfolio" section nor relevant works that we have committed

Did you just get coffee as contractors, so your work was irrelevant for the project?

It is totally valid to add such work into this part of your website. Don't sell it as totally your work, but if someone hires me o be part of a team, then I can say so.

Contractors are independent self employed business oeprators or one people companies, normally. WHen those sole propietors form a company doing the same thing, then iti s totally ok to use experience as marketing. There is not even the need to ask for permission UNELSS it was explicitely denied (i.e. confidentiality agreement).

> Can we use the names of the clients were we had worked in the past in our company Portfolio?

Yes, but you should not do that. See, legally your client was not the company you worked for but the company your contract ran with which is some body shop handling contractors. BPut the end client name and project references in there ;)

> What's the best thing to do to make clients trust our company even if we have just started?

Time. High known people with goood contacts known in the industry. Blogs. People with a name and contacts in your company that reach out and get customers.
