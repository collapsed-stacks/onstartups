Faebook has a sign up form on the front page itself? has any body done A/B test on something like this vs. another page loaded for the sign up form?

<p><strong>You can't automatically re-use A/B test results from one company for another...</strong> Facebook can show a sign-up form without a site tour because everyone knows what Facebook <em>is</em>. A small company just starting out is probably not so lucky.</p>

<p>If you can get results from a company very similar to yours, in a very similar market, then maybe you can reuse their A/B test results. But the best thing would be to run your own A/B tests, and engage with customers over a more rich communication channel (phone, usability tests in person, observing users interact with your site in their homes, etc).</p>

<p>A side note, long term I think the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/signupforms" rel="nofollow">signup form will die</a>. Intuitively what Luke Wroblewski says in that article makes a lot of sense, but getting it done may be hard.</p>
