I'm no expert in this area, and I've heard that search engines can be very unforgiving when you try to change or restructure things in certain ways. What should I definitely NOT do? Are there certain things that are wrong but are better left *unoptimized* if I already have a high page rank?

Yup, and if you are ever wondering whether or not to undertake a particular strategy, ask yourself if it adds to your users' experience. 

A few notes: if you are changing domain names make sure your redirects are done properly. Always be aware of potential duplicate content, and I would advise to leave pages with high authority alone. Look at your Analytics tool to see which pages are your most important landing pages and don't mess too much with those.

Better leave robot.txt file part, and don't think of making a keyword rich content, write naturally. Consult an internet marketer for link building.
