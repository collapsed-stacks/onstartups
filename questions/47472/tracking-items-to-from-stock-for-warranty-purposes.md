We buy stock from our suppliers, book this stock to stores, then call this stock off project by project delivering to the client and invoicing for it.

When an item breaks at the clients site it needs to be returned to us, then on for RMA to the supplier.

The date the item was bought from the supplier (not the date we delivered) is the start of the warranty.

What best way can we tie this information together, so given a customer invoice or delivery-note, we can trace back to when stock was ordered from the supplier (and pull up the suppliers invoice)?

Batch Management..

Device a way to code the batch numbers with Supplier, and Stock order date included and assign the Batch numbers on the Customer Invoice and Delivery-note against each of the line item provided on it.
