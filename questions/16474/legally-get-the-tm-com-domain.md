I have a TM, let's call it 'brandX'.

Is there a way that I can legally get brandX.com domain without having to pay tons of money for it?

Thanks

<p>If the owner of brandX.com has infringed on your trademark with bad faith intent, i.e. they are using it in the same goods/services class, then you may have rightful cause to obtain the domain under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Domain_Name_Dispute_Resolution_Policy" rel="nofollow">ICANN UDRP arbitration</a> or, if you live in the United States, to file suit in federal court under the terms of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticybersquatting_Consumer_Protection_Act" rel="nofollow">ACPA</a>. I highly suggest you review both of the Wikipedia articles I have linked toâ€”they give specific criteria under which you may legally obtain the domain.</p>
