I am filing for a LLC. It asks for the nature of business, what I should put in there? What my company doing, in one sentence, is - "provide location based service via web/website and mobile device based software applications"

EDIT: I ended up filed "Mobile and Internet based software company", does that sound reasonable?

For a government form, that is probably overly specific. 

I'd rephrase your response to the form as: "Provide a software service via the web and mobile devices."

Nobody who reviews it will have a clue about types of web services. 

One thing to watch out for is your state's tax law regarding IT and DP related services, which some states tax differently than personal services. They may need to be handled differently for your company depending upon how you phrase this statement.

Depending on what state you are filing your LLC in, you can sometimes just put something similar to this: "to transact any or all lawful business for which a limited liability company may be organized under the laws of the State of XX".  If the state requires specifics, try to be as vague as possible while being honest of course in the event what you do deviates.
