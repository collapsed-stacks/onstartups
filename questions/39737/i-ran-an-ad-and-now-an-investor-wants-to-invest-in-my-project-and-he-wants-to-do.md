## I ran an ad and now an investor wants to invest in my project and he wants to do several things first. Is this an odd request?

He wants to open a Chase Bank account for the investment. So my question is how do I protect myself if for some reason this person is trying to lauder money through my project? What protection can I put in place if it turns out their desire to invest has an ulterior motive?

 - Get the background of the guy.
 - Get information about where he had previously invested and the outcome.
 - **Before sign anything get legal advice**
