What is a reasonable equity split where two people have been working separately on a similar tech idea and are now looking to join forces. These individuals are friends. Despite both working tirelessly on their respective apps, and investing heavily, one has made more progress on the app and has achieved a fit for purpose ready to launch early version. She is inviting the other to join her for an equity stake in the combined business. The friend brings distinct skills and will be pivotal in developing a second market for the app (which is where she has been focussing her efforts). Both share a similar vision for the product, and passion.
The venture is pre-revenue (it hasn't officially been launched yet, and there are no customers), and pre-investment.
Is it reasonable to offer a 80/20 split?
Or is it fairer to offer higher for the person being invited?
