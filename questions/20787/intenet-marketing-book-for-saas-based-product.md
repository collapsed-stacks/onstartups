My startup is a SaaS product and Inbound Marketing was a HUGE help

- Read with a highlighter - Underline important stuff as your reading. Take your time and read slowly
- Use a flagger - Flag your pages where you highlight stuff
- Read with a notebook - Whenever you come up with a blog idea or something for social media, write it down in your notebook the instant you think of it

I came up with at least 100 new ideas for marketing my startup cheaply and effectively after reading this book.
