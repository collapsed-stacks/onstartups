<p>So I have an LLC in the US that runs a stock image website, and we pay designers who contribute images as independent contractors. At the end of the year we send out 1099-misc forms to everyone, and voila, the end. </p>

<p>Now I'm interested in having an EU designer (from the Netherlands) contribute some designs, but I'm trying to figure out what kind of paperwork will likely be necessary (or not). I've done some preliminary research, but without finding much... anyone know what's likely to be required here? In terms of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Paperwork that my LLC will need to send to the IRS. </li>
<li>Paperwork that my LLC will need to send to the individual. </li>
<li>Paperwork that my LLC will need to send to the EU/Netherlands.</li>
</ol>

<p>The amount of money that we're talking about here is quite small... probably on the order of hundreds of dollars USD over the course of the year (possibly low thousands).</p>
