I just started selling my software and I wanted to know what is your average percentage of paid subscribers for each week during/after a 30 day trial period.

Example: For 100 users who have paid for the software during/after the trial period. What is the average percentage of those who have paid during the first week, second week, third week, forth week and after trial ended.

The question is about timing. So, of all your paid users, when did they transform their free trial to paid one.

Pierre is correct in stating it varies by industry.  Ill give you this without spilling too much of my personal beans.

I have a really specific b2b subscription service, with a 14 day trial.  Our cancellation ratio is about 4/5.  It is expensive, and very specific.

We also have a few consumer based products, that allow free unlimited versions and 30 day trials of more professional features.  These products are geared to the average web user.  Most customers remain free forever (80%+),  and of the ones that go for the trial, less than 1 out of 20 remain and allow their credit card to be billed.

Again, Pierre is very correct that this varies based on each product, industry, pricing, and even your market.

In our case it takes about 1 month after their trial expires, it's B2B, niche market and expensive.
