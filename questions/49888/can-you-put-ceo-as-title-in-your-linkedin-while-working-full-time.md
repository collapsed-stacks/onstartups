I am working full time as a Software Developer and I am making my startup go live this September 2013. My question is that, should I/Not put CEO/Founder Title in my LinkedIn profile while working full time in current company? 

Moving on, I would like to tract some investors down the road (possibly end of this year) so having a professional LinkedIn account with CEO/Founder will make more sense :\?

I dont know I am confused, hope anyone can shed their advice on this.

Be accurate and honest with your LinkedIn profile. Employers don't own you after hours and, barring any non-compete issues, can't stop you from pursuing other ventures or sources of income. That said, you don't  want to give the appearance that you're looking to leave them anytime soon either. In fact, though some employers could see it as threatening, many will see outside work/initiative as a very positive thing. They see you're passionate about the work you do and are keeping your skills sharpened outside of regular business hours. While in a corporate setting I've had direct reports who did that and it became a reason for me to make sure their pay/benefits were top-notch - so they didn't leave for another opportunity. From my perspective, if they were going to leave for another venture I couldn't stop them anyway so I'd maximize their expertise before they left. But I was much more interested in retaining great talent like that! 

So list your side business on LinkedIn and definitely go with "Founder" over "CEO". CEO can sound like you're trying to be bigger than you really are and that can be a turn-off. Founder is accurate, lets potential investors know you're in charge of the venture and won't raise your current employers eyebrows as much as you being the "CEO of a start-up". Best of luck!

Everything you publish on line can be found by anyone - you should always be careful about information you release to the world.

If your manager doesn't know about your side business then linkedin (or facebook, twitter, etc.) is probably not the best way fro him/her to find out.

On the other hand, if you are looking for investors then your linkedin profile (and every other on-line presence you may have) should show you are the founder of your business and you should make sure there isn't anywhere that say you are employed elsewhere.
