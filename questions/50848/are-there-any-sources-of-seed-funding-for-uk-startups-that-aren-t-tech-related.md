I'm looking for funding for a business, lets say its the "creative / media" market.

I am trying to get seed Equity funding but am hitting a brick wall trying to find this.

all investment groups / crowd-funders seem to be interested in is:
"Tech startups"
"Biotech"
"Green Technologies"
and every 2nd project on crowdfunding sites:
"Internet platforms"

Are there any sources for REAL businesses? for example if someone wanted to start up a supermarket, and needs capital for setup, stock, advertising etc....
and: The bank said no, no personal savings to throw at it, no "friends and family" option (i mean really, who's family has £100k sitting around?!)

For new startups in the £10k region in the UK there are the government backed Startup Loans (see http://www.startuploans.co.uk/).

There are certainly angel networks that look at non-tech startups. I know http://siliconbeach.pro/ have funded things like new kinds of sheets for hospitals for example. However - they're a long way from starting up things like supermarkets.

The "problem" for businesses like supermarkets are that they are established markets with low margins. You're unlikely to get a VC/Angel funded supermarket because the returns are going to be too low. You'll need to *show* that you'll able to provide a reasonable chance of substantial returns.
