For more background on my company, see the question entitled: "A “competitive edge” for an offshore development company?"

We have landed a meeting (scheduled for about 5 days from now) with a very large, local company. The contract in discussion will be long-term, and will be the chance we need for our company to really grow. Essentially, we see this as our moment to make it or break it. 

Needless to say, we can't blow this opportunity. A barrage of questions have flooded into my mind: 

-What questions should we anticipate? 

-How long should we make our presentation?

-Should it be strictly conversational, should we include graphics? 

-Is powerpoint overdoing it? etc. etc. etc. 

In other words: How can we prepare for this meeting?

Any advice in answer to these questions would be a tremendous help! Thanks in advance!

**Some additional information to add clarity: 

We don't yet know all of the specifics of the project they are looking to offer. We know it is long term, and for our company, it will make a big difference.

This is just a preliminary meeting to see who we are and what we can offer them. We will find out a good deal more about what they want at the meeting, but right now we need to know how to approach this. I suppose it might be termed a 'meet and greet' except we obviously have to show them what we can do.**

When negotiation with a large company, at least in the US:

  * Spend a minute of two introducing everyone to everyone so everyone has a mental picture of who is responsible for what. Also helps break the ice, so do so with a smile.
  * LISTEN to them. What do they really want? Often they will tell you much that will define the context of the larger discussion. Make sure every person from your team is listening when they are talking.
  * If listening doesn't reveal much, ask them what their vision is with your tech/license/product/company. Usually sheds some light on some strengths you guys have that previously seemed irrelevant.
  * Create a template/model of the deal in excel off the most important terms (eg. price, volume, duration of contract etc). If you do this before hand itself, you'll know what is the most important term for you and what's not. More importantly, if they suddenly change the volume from 1 million to 10,000 units, you will quickly have a rough idea if this is even sensible to you instead of getting confused. Golden rule : Keep the model simple, it could be a watered down version of your full blown 'real' business model. You want to enter a number being negotiated (eg "10000") and quickly see the net $ profit in under 1 second to appear fluid in verbal communication as well as eye contact.
  * If things get challenging, propose a 5 minute (restroom/bathroom) break during the meeting if you want to gather your bearings. Step outside the conference room and talk privately among yourselves.
  * Understand that the person often has to justify/champion the deal themselves inside their company. Can you make his/her life easier?

(edit) Was having my coffee thinking about this, to add

  * Before the actual meeting, internally agree on who has actual authority in altering/agreeing/negotiating the terms on your side versus who are required for a supporting role (eg. CEO and VP Sales will talk contract terms with CTO only jumping on technical questions). If things aren't going as planned, take that 5 minute break.
