I would like to start a ecommerce website in India, could you please help me with the legal requirements and any guidance for this. My intent is to sell merchandise through internet. Do I need to register my establishment as a Shop?  What other legal and government formalities involved here?

You have multiple options

1. You can set it as sole proprietary
2. Private Limited Company
3. Limited Liability Company ... 

You should consult a CA for this in India on what is the best way to approach this.
you can get some direction from http://www.mca.gov.in (Ministry of Corporate Affairs), http://www.nenonline.org (National Entrepreneurship Network ) and many startup forums like yourstory.in

Raga, I have noticed that there haven't been many good answers to law / tax or business setup questions specific to India on here.

I know in the US to start an e-commerce website you don't even need to file any business paperwork. At a minimum all you NEED to do is file your additional income on your yearly taxes.  But - that's in the US, and that's the minimum. It's usually recommended to form a true business entity if you are expecting to sell a significant amount or have the potential for any liability.
