I am thinking that I should somehow find end users of my software that I had developed. I don't have lot of money for advertising but the software can be modified enough to fit the needs of Governments and Industry specific corporations.

The problem is where do you find Request For Proposals, how does the bidding work ?

is this like findafreelancer.com except you can find very large pocket client ?


so the bottom line is, how do you land the big contracts with large clients ? is it by using RFP databases ? if so, how do you get started in bidding for RFP projects ?

You should sign up for an account with Bidspeed (http://www.fedbidspeed.com)

Bidspeed has all published federal opportunities automatically updated into the application. If you want local opportunities you will need to signip with a local data aggregator, govdirections, bidsync, ...

You can still use Bidspeed to track local deals (and you'll want to).

<p>If there is a local SBA office where you live, that may be a good start to find out about federal government opportunities in your area and the requirements.  Our SBA office holds regular seminars on federal government contracting and also holds matching events for suppliers and government agencies.  Here is a write up on federal government opportunities on the SBA website.</p>

<p>Researching on the web is great.  I am also a big believer of picking up the phone and calling and asking questions.  For state government contracts, the bidding process, opportunities and requirements will vary by state and agency. Your local SBA office may be able to help or you may have to do your own leg work.  </p>

<p>For large sales to the federal or state government or a business, in the end you are really selling to people.  Finding out who the key people are who make the decision to buy your products and networking or connecting with them is key so they know who you are and what your product can do for them and then they will be more willing to buy from you.</p>

The rules for sales to federal and state governments can be arcane and complex. What I've done in the past multiple times is this: instead of trying to get into the government RFP/bidding process directly, **partner with a reseller** who already does business with that government. There are many very qualified resellers; some are larger firms, and some are smaller concerns just like you probably are. But they already are plugged in to the government processes and people; that's what they do for a living.

Yes, they'll get a cut of your action, but by partnering, each party can specialize in what they're best at: the partner at selling software to the government, and you at making great software. 

I'd start by looking for local or regional resellers who do software sales and ask about their government programs. Or you could look at major resellers like http://www.softmart.com/ (not an endorsement, just an example).

Good luck in the new year!
