Want to start an online food retail store selling mostly dried foods from all around the world. Start up capital is approximately $2000. I already have my online store application built, initial graphics taken care of, so I will say storefront is good to go. However, the licensing issue has been the pain so far. I am not certain what particular licences I need to be able to import foods, for instance nuts and grains without needing to blend them down and the sort. Any ideas what exactly I need? I would like to be able to travel to different countries and import necessary inventory with less hassle, for sale in my store. And I would also like to be able to order these items and have them shipped directly to me with little or no headaches. The folks at the local small buisiness office seem to have an attitude but not much else in the area of details on particular forms I need to fill to be able to do this in bulk.
