I would like to hear your thoughts on the best possible options for a cheap and effective marketing strategy for a b2b advertising website start-up?

Since as you can imagine for most of start ups budget tend to be somehow limited, I wonder if you have any direct experience implementing cheap, yet highly effective marketing strategy in you business of similar nature?

All relevant ideas are very much appreciated.

Thank you.

<p>Since you seem to be a B2B advertising company yourself, and you need the services of a B2B advertising  company, the cheapest thing you could do would be to use your own services. But you have probably thought of that already...</p>

<p>If I can extrapolate from your question, I don't think you are looking to build a brand so much as get web traffic. "Cheap" and "effective" are often at cross purposes. What you really want is "cost effective".</p>

<p><strong>SEO</strong></p>

<p>It all starts here. <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/8748/seo-priorities-for-startup">This is a good post about SEO.</a></p>

<p><strong>PPC</strong></p>

<p>You will probably want to stay away from PPC for now as it has a learning curve that can cost some money up front. (Not a learning curve about PPC itself, but a learning curve about which keywords are profitable.) I know, some of you out there are raving PPC fans. But remember, @NewWebStartUp said "cheap".</p>

<p><strong>Content Marketing</strong></p>

<p>For less than $50 a month you can distribute to web publishers an unlimited number of articles that establish your credibility as an expert in your field and get you links back to your site. <em>Full disclosure: this is what my company does. See my profile if you want to more info.</em></p>

<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>

<p>You can make some fairly small ad buys at a variety of places. <a href="http://www.netchunks.com/top-buysellads-alternatives/" rel="nofollow">Here is a list of ad brokers you can use.</a></p>
