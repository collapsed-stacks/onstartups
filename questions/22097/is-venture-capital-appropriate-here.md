I'm a student and  an iOS developer. I am trying to pay for advertising for my apps. Is this a situation where I'd want to raise venture capital? I develop my apps solo, sometimes my own ideas, others are contracted out.

If yes, how does VC work? (Yea, an open ended question, I know.)

**Edit:**

Here are a few more details: 

I've considered both iAd and other promotion websites. They all require several thousand dollars which *I don't have* right now.

I'm a student and a budding facebook developer, with other previously launched windows software, so I'm in a similar situation. The best thing I can suggest from my own experience with advertising software, which I did profitably, is to start small and make sure you can turn every dollar you spend into at least a dollar in income. 

You won't need VC unless you're looking to go into this full time with a staff, office, equipment, etc. Even if you DO want to do that (I know I would go for it) you'll still have to explain why your product is different and why it would be profitable, which is easier said than done unfortunately.

Going on the few details you have given, I'd say VC is probably not appropriate. 

Can you bootstrap to pay for what you need and then reinvest your sales revenue into marketing and development?

<p>Two Options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Word of mouth</strong>.  Free, if you find the right people to root for your apps (blogs, reviews, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>How about <a href="https://adwords.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google AdWords</a> as a low-cost method (to start)?  I haven't yet reached the stage where it makes sense to use it myself, but the feature of setting a budget (say, $20/month) seems pretty cool.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You don't need a VC at this stage.</p>
