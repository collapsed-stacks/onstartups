Don't know of any great books I'm afraid, but I would suggest that apart from the usual sales-related interpersonal skills, being a "successful middleman" boils down to **adding genuine value** to one or both sides of the market you serve.  Typically this is along the lines of a specialist skill/understanding, but equally it may just be in terms of breadth of knowledge about the market - where to find buyers/sellers, what the needs of each are and how to bridge any gap between them, etc.

HTH.
