We are currently building a website which includes a monthly subscription plan(s).  We have a merchant account with Streamline and looking for a payment gateway.

We would like to use a billing management services but seems it's limited in the UK. I know there is Chargify.com, Plimus and CheddarGetter.com.  But don't seem to support many UK payment gateways.

Anyone know of a management software and payment provider for UK?

Cheers

John

<p>This came up recently as a topic on the BizSpark UK group</p>

<p>Here's the link if you have access - <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;gid=2179419&amp;type=member&amp;item=42503015&amp;qid=b0cbe766-a08f-49a8-9cce-3517365afefe&amp;goback=.gmp_2179419" rel="nofollow">bizspark</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, here's a blog writeup about the discussion we had and some research that was done afterwards - <a href="http://blogs.thesitedoctor.co.uk/tim/2011/02/25/Recurring+Payment+Provider+Options+For+A+UK+Startup.aspx" rel="nofollow">Tim's blog</a></p>

<p>I do think there's a gap in the market for a UK company to do this at present - especially if they could take on lots of the hassle about e.g. VAT invoicing.</p>

We did the same research about 2 years for SnapExpense and landed on SecureTrading. Not too shabby. It works, it's secure and the support has been really great. What sucked (and might still suck) is that you can't run a dev/testing account in parallel with a live account. We had to develop it and then one day switch from dev to live as we deployed on the live server.
