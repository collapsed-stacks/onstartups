I'm looking for a low-impact way to implement an affiliate program for a web app. Looking for a reasonably priced turnkey solution that doesn't require a lot implementation. Are there simple to implement solutions out there? I don't want to distract my dev team from our product.

I hate to unask your question but: why do you want an affiliate program? It's vanishingly rare for an affiliate program to generate a reasonable number of leads. It works for Ebay and Amazon because they have gigantic catalogs, but the spam, and the headaches, and the cost of cutting a million little checks every month are not worth it for many (most) sites.

My experience at Fog Creek setting up an affiliate program was that is was an almost total and complete waste of time that we should have spent making our product better so that more people would actually want it.

Your mileage may vary, of course... I don't know anything about your app or your market.

<p>I am not contradicting Joel.  That is, I don't know if there is value in setting up an affiliate program.</p>

<p>However, for information's sake, I have seen use of <a href="http://www.cj.com" rel="nofollow">Commission Junction</a> by Best Buy Remix and Biblio.</p>

Joel, interesting, thanks for sharing your experience with this.

Justyn, I know another company that uses http://www.idevdirect.com/ - might be worth looking into. I don't know too much about it other than I know someone that uses it.
