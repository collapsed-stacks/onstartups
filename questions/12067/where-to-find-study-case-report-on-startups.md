Harvard business review and university libraries have access to case studies or at least the abstracts.  The good stuff needs to be purchased.  There are a number of case studies on the internet as well but they tend to not be as indepth as the ones in the business schools that of course require payment.

<p>Here's one source that I've looked through before: <a href="http://www.startup-review.com/blog/case-study-index/index.php" rel="nofollow">Startup Review</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.startup-review.com/blog/authors/" rel="nofollow">authors</a> appear to be fairly knowledgeable. One is an attorney, the other two were analysts at venture capital firms.</p>

Also, lots of good textbooks that are used in University entrepreneurship courses have good case studies. There are two I would recommend:

 1. *New Venture Creation* by Timmons & Spinelli - This is a great book about new ventures, finding, evaluating and building them. It also has comprehensive case studies at the end of each chapter. I used this in my Masters of Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

 2. *Entrepreneurship* by Bygraves and Zacharakis - this is written for an undergrad level and I use it with my students. The text is crap but the case studies at the end of each chapter are really interesting and a little more straightforward. They are all about Babson College students.

I've also found lots of interesting interviews with different people online that are really informative.

And (depending on what you want case studies for) I like to look at startup's websites and try to work out what their business model is. I have learnt a lot from doing this. I also get my students to go through this exercise as I think it is great for sharpening your understanding of business.
