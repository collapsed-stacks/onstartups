## Iphone-like email management on the web

I have multiple email accounts from different domains that I currently manage in Outlook at home. Lately I had some issues with Outlook breaking and I've decided to move my emails on the web.

I love Outlook but I find the way Iphone email work simpler since I need only the email features not calendar, etc.

So basically, I'm looking for a service that offers web based email allowing me to manage multiple accounts from different domains and see all inboxes at once like in the IPhone. Most important, I want to be able to send emails from each of my accounts and the system will know which 'from' email address to use automatically.

I don't like the way hotmail and gmail works because of the "on behalf of" thing and also the fact that you can't have multiple inboxes like Outlook and Iphone does.

Any suggestions?

Thanks Steve

gmail works fine for me for this.  You can change the "on behalf of" if you change the mail settings.  You change the settings to use the proper smtp/mail server for that account.
