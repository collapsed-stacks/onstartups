Currently I'm using a VPS from Network Solutions, they are running Fedora Core release 6. It's ancient and they are not going to upgrade it. I want a VPS with the latest, or at least not so old, OS releases. This will be for developing with Python, MySQL and Django. Any recommendations?

Thank you!

<p>A few options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.linode.com/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">Linode</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.slicehost.com/" rel="nofollow">Slicehost</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">Rackspace</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I personally recommend Linode. It has good value, good speed, low latency, and very little downtime (less than 2 hours in a year). Test and see which works best for you.</p>

I recommend Media Temple. I've used them on and off for years and I haven't had any problems. I currently use their (ve) service running Ubuntu and I'm quite happy with it.

<p>I use <a href="http://www.gandi.net" rel="nofollow"><strong>Gandi</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Their only disadvantage is the they are French ;) (joking)</p>

Linode and Webbynode are great. Webbynode's ready-stacks got me up and running with Rails 3 on Ubuntu in no time, and their one line command-line git based gem handles pushing to the server, well, in one line! Check out their options for python. Linode on the other hand has a great library of supporting documentation on setup, frameworks, etc. And both of them seem to have great customer service.

<p><a href="http://www.hostgator.com/vps-hosting/" rel="nofollow"><strong>HostGator</strong> VPS</a>, so far, I've found to be very competent.</p>

<p>You might get better answers asking at <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/">Pro Webmasters</a>, though. <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/search?q=%2Bhosting+%2Bcompany">Some hosting questions there.</a></p>

<p>I've previously used Slicehost and had no complaints, but currently I use <a href="http://www.xtrahost.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Xtraordinary Hosting</a> because they give you a higher spec for the same amount of money.</p>

<p>Slicehost's servers are in St. Louis whereas Xtrahost's are in London, but to me it makes no real difference.</p>

I've had good experience with Knownhost (no real downtime that wasn't our fault in 3+ years).  It's unmanaged, but when I've been unavailable to help my partner, they've helped a lot (in fact, I'm not doing anything with it and letting him/them manage it since I've pulled out of the business quite a bit).

I use servint for VPS and mediatemple for shared hosting. Mediatemple also provides VPS but I did not want to put all my eggs in the same basket.
