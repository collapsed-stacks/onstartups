I am looking to offer a software solution which can target public and private audiences. By public, I mean that it can used for personal use. By private, I mean that it can used by companies. There are more features available for private users. However the concept remains the same for both. The public side of the app will be free for sign up. The private there is a charge associated with it. The question that I have is do I create two separate applications or one? The main goal for the public users is the social and sharing functionality, where you can build a community of users with a common goals. The main goal for private users is that their community doesn't go further then their organization.

As far as creating two separate product, this is almost like Lexus and Toyota. Both are vehicles, but one has more richer features. I wonder if it is applicable in software, or is recommended?

Is there any way that you can combine the experiences you offer to both public and private users in order to create synergistic benefits to both? If so, then my inclination would be to combine the applications. However, I don't know what kinds of use cases you're dealing with.

Facebook, for example, separates the user account management and "pages" account management experiences. This seems to me to be because most "pages" managers also have ordinary Facebook accounts. If private users are not also public users, and vice-versa, then the reasons for which Facebook separated their applications may not apply to you.

I'm wondering, why did you add the "investors" and "consulting" tags?

Best of luck!

<p>Wouldn't a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium" rel="nofollow">freemium</a> model work?</p>

<p>Have a solid base level of features available to all users.  Both individuals and businesses can use the basic features which should be of decent value on their own.  Then have ways to enable more advanced features, or buy in-app upgrades and premium features that businesses or individuals can subscribe to if they want the added benefits.</p>

<p>I would create them as one, and just allow the user to upgrade to un-lock additional features.  To use your analogy it would be like a Toyota, except when you insert your credit card it turns in to a Lexus ;)</p>
