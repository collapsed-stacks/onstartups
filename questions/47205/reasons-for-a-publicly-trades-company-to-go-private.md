Karlson is of course correct that few startups would ever consider this question when they are typically facing the myriad of other challenges that startups must confront.

However, if this answer might benefit an entrepreneur with an unusually far-sighted business plan:

Pros of returning private--

 - Consolidating legal authority for the executive and chairman of the board
 - Reducing exposure to oversight from the SEC
 - Consolidating equity ownership

Cons--

 - Less access to funding
 - May anger smaller investors
 - Potential for liability in the transition
