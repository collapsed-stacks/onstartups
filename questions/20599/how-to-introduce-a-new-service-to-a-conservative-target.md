We have a shop that sells to resellers. So far, we get the orders by phone calls or faxes. I have been tuning a website that will allow resellers to do all those common tasks online, plus some extra features.

My worry is that our customers are old fashioned and simply will not care about the online shop and will prefer to continue doing stuff in the traditional way. 
What is the best way to hook them and make them understand this service? Any previous experience is very welcome!

My company works with small business owners in the rental industry. It's about as old fashioned an industry that you can find. Here are some lessons I've learned in the past 3 months through dealing with our customers:

- **There's no such thing as 100% intuitive UI** - You need to make training videos for people to watch and understand how to use your product. You're better off just buckling down and making a video for every new feature than assuming they'll get it (they won't). You'll spend a lot of time on the phone if you don't have training videos and documentation

- **Make small changes instead of mind-blowing ones** - One way to ensure adoption is to make slow, gradual changes to the way your customers do business. Instead of giving them the whole system, give them part of it. Create the order for them, and email them a link to the final checkout screen so all they have to do is put their credit card in. They'll then see that its' easier to pay online than making a phone call, and will be entice to figure how to place orders online.

- **If you can train a dog, you can train a customer** - Training your dog takes relentless focus and paitence, but once you've done it, the rewards are great (you actually enjoy your dog). You'll have to use the same techniques for training your customer. Reward them with compliments for using the correct ordering system. You could even give them a discount for ordering online if it decreases your admin & support costs. If someone calls on the phone, take the order the old fashioned way, and then say you'll give them a 5% discount if they let you email the order and they pay online.

As an entrepreneur, you want to always be creating systems. That's really your only job. I think you have a really great idea in creating an online ordering platform, and it's just going to take some persistence and stick-with-it-ness.

Good points Andy. 

It is all about value as well.. How much more value will you offer through the web and how will your customers' relate to the benefits of the web version? Why are they still using Fax and Phone? what's the pain point in the process?

Let's take some scenarios: 

  - Lost order and order tracking: When you order by phone or Fax, traceability is hard for you and your customers. The first step would be to provide this tracking online, and systematically send your customers to the web site for this. You are not asking them to order online at that point, but you show them the value of having things online. 

  - Obviously, on the site, where they can see the tracking/status of their order, you will push the fact that they can also order directly and save money (no fax cost, no time on the phone, no mistake, etc..)

  - You can also phase out some of the things your do by fax and phone over time. Make sure your communication is clear: Every footer, every header will say: "Now online, yadiyda".. "Online only starting in X months", etc.. Every phone call, you need to remind them of your online version and benefits, every letter you send, every fax, every email.. Over communicating will help you.

Try to identify the biggest pain point first and then start with this. As Andy said: "Make small changes instead of mind-blowing ones".

Not sure what's in it for those customers if they prefer phone and fax. I've been on the other end of suppliers that wanted us to process orders on their website. For some reason they thought it would be easier for us to take our automatically printed order from our system and then hand enter it on their website (double entry on our part) instead of us just sending the fax (We had larger suppliers that accepted via EDI.). Of course it saved them the trouble of keying in our order. Many tried to sell us on the fact that our data entry people would be more accurate than theirs; sorry, but that's not our problem.

 - Does this make the entire process
   faster for the customer? They may be
   willing to do online and enter orders
   if you process things quicker in the
   long-term.
 - Will it expand your hours of
   operation?
 - Do they get a discount?

You started this site with no feedback from existing customers? You may find it easier to get new customers to use the site and grandfather your current customers on phone/fax if you can't convert them. Or let everyone know that the phone/fax is too cost prohibitive for you and discontinue.
