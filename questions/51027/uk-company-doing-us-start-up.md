<p>I have helped ~40 foreign clients bring their businesses to the US and have blogged extensively about the issues they face. I recommend that you start at my blog's <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/foreign-countries/" rel="nofollow">Foreign Countries</a> page and follow links from there.</p>

<p>Formation of a corporation and obtaining an Employer Identification Number will be reasonably straightforward. Having a Canadian employee will be relatively straightforward from the US perspective (adapting standard employment-related documents), though I am not qualified to comment on additional paperwork that will be required to address Canadian legal issues or on the mechanics of paying the individual.</p>

<p>You will need, in the US, both a lawyer and an accountant / tax advisor who have experience working with international clients.</p>
