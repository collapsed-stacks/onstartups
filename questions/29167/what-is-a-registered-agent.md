I'm researching how to start an LLC. I found a site called LegalZoom and when you fill out the forms, one question they ask is:

> Who will serve as the Limited Liability Company's registered agent?

>The registered agent must have a physical address (no P.O. boxes) in the state of formation. The registered agent's name and contact information will become public information on the records of the state. If you choose LegalZoom to serve as your registered agent, we help protect your privacy and filter junk mail. Furthermore, we notify you about important state and federal filing requirements and will be on hand to answer your questions.The first month of registered agent service is free and doesn't start until your LLC is effective. After that, the service renews automatically for $159.00 a year -- cancel at any time by calling (866) 698-0052. 

So, what is a registered agent? Does it keep my real name hidden from people who are trying to find out? (such as potential employers, friends, nosy people)

A registered agent is the main point of contact for a Corporation/LLC for legal purposes. It's the person in charge of filling out legal applications, such as EIN Forms, and the one who receives legal mail on the corporations behalf, for law suits, etc. This person's name and address is usually public record, I believe.
