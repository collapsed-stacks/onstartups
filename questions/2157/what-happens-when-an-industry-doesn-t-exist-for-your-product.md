What happens when you made a product for an industry that doesn't exist? I mean it sells, it makes revenue but the industry cannot be defined. 

Is this a bad sign or a good sign?

I believe that is a case where you know there exists a market for your product but it has not been named yet. As I see it, the scenario is much better than carving a new market for yourself. Infact, you probably have all the freedom to name and modify this market as per your need which is a very good thing. 

Last night, I was reading an article where Pizza Hut had posted a job for an intern who would tweet for the company and handle all other social media accounts. That intern did the job so well that shes being hired as a full time employee, only if they find a name for her post in the company. New products may need new markets, offer new areas of employment and set new norms. You are probably at a stage where you can be the one, defining these norms.

Define the industry, invest some time in indirectly setting a few norms/rules/standards for this market! It is definitely a good sign that the market distinction exists, for you and your product :)

An "industry" is a case where the map is not necessarily an accurate or useful representation of reality. Take for example any large company. It may be part of the "automotive" industry. But many of its departments do things and need software that have nothing to do with cars.

What's a more useful approach for you might be to profile what your present customers have in common and decide on new ways of reaching others who fit that profile.

As long as it brings in revenue, and provided that the revenue is higher than the cost, it's a good sign.

What could possibly have no industry yet? Spool recharging bearings for interstellar faster-than-light jump drives?

There are only a handful of industries out there, and if you can't pick one, then you're thinking far too narrowly. Before Twitter, there was no "micro-blogging industry" but there was a "blogging industry", and Twitter fit right in. It was a little different, but everything neeeds to be a little different to compete.

Wait. Who's buying the product? What are the demographics of your customers? Are you selling to businesses or to consumers?

I think if you do some deeper analysis of your buyers, you will at least define market segments or verticals that you can target.

That pretty much describes several markets Steve Jobs took Apple into. People use the word visionary a lot on him, with good reason. He could work out what would solve the problem better than the products that currently define the market. If you're trying to do the same thing, make sure at least a few people outside of your friends and family view you as having some skill in the "visionary" department.
