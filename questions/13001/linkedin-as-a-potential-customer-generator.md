It is generally accepted that LinkedIn can be tremendously important as an employee resource, collaboration and research site.  It is less often used for customer development.  Can anyone provide concrete examples of LinkedIn being used to generate B2B leads, and more importantly, to engage and call those potential customers to action?

I have a web-based application that's for B2C and B2B although the business side is typically smaller businesses. So I'm definitely not the best answer for you. But I can tell you I did advertising on Linkedin and on Facebook. The tools, analytics and results were dramatically better for Facebook. I tried two separate times and finally gave up. Sorry, not much of an answer.

<p>I see some people locally using the message boards within a network.  I don't know about direct leads from it, but it may be more about repitition and people checking you out online before making a sale.</p>

<p>I've seen some marketers use LinkedIn's Groups and Answers products to try to generate B2B leads. I don't know how effective these campaigns were though.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers/product-management/market-research-definition/PRM_MRS/635897-445582?browseIdx=0&amp;sik=1279995522848&amp;goback=.amq" rel="nofollow">Here's an example</a> of a question I had asked on LinkedIn. Some of the answers feel like they were self-promotional in nature. I don't think I can show you any similar examples in a Group unless you are part of the Group as well. But you could join a few and take a look at how others have used it for lead generation.</p>

<p>On the surface, it seems to me that this is a very manual process. I doubt the conversion rate is very high. It's doubtful to me that LinkedIn is a good source of B2B leads, but you could certainly try it out for a month and then examine your results &amp; ROI.</p>

Why not try it yourself? Stick google analytics on your website (it should be there already), and check under Traffic Sources -> Social -> Overview. It'll give a ranking of all your incoming links from all the social networks.

Then try posting a bunch of stuff to LinkedIn, as well as Facebook groups, Twitter, whatever and see where people actually come from.

I think it depends a lot on your business and your connections. I've been personally using LinkedIn for a long time, and have 500+ connections there, so I naturally get more traffic there than say Facebook (which I never use), but YMMV.
