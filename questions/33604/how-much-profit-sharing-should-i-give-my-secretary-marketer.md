I am a part-time programmer contractor and usually I do everything myself, including meeting clients, writing the proposal, programming, the whole 9 yards.  I would like to hire someone to split the non-programming tasks so I can focus purely on programming (with project management).  

How much should I give my new secretary as a percentage of a project's total cost?  Usually my projects are pretty small from a few hundreds to the low thousands.

Their responsibilities will be mostly 2 parts: to acquire projects by doing marketing, and to meet clients when necessary.

----------------------

EDIT:  I was originally thinking 20%, too much/too little?  Please let me know.

EDIT 2:  I currently work by myself and do not hire anyone.

AH - nothing. Pay her market rate. Or hire someone on an hourly basis.

Think of this from the employee's point of view. The standard model for most employees is they get paid a wage to do a job. You're in essence talking about giving them 20% of your revenue, this leaves you with scalability issues if you ever grow.

I would give them a fixed salary for a fixed number of hours, no profit sharing. Ultimately, if they don't bring in, say, x2, of the revenue they generate for you, you fire them.

OK, in between that there's some time span where you support them to enable them to achieve that, but I find it's best not to lose track of that fundamental equation. Profit sharing clouds that calculation.

20% sounds like a lot for someone in a non-creative non-technical role. But it makes sense if it is the only compensation they receive. Personally, I would prefer to pay such a person a fixed rate based on the duration of work performed.
