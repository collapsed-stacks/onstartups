Currently I have been personally funding my tech related start up idea by paying a developer to get it to the demo stage where it is now. In order to get it to the next level the costs increase as I was expecting. (I approached the developer I had been using to partner with, but he is more of a project manager working with various developers and I signed a contract not to recruit his developers).

I am looking to bring on a developer/programmer to reduce costs and have an individual in-house to grow with the company and produce ideas. I do not have a coding background at all so my technology connections are very limited and there is no way I could do it myself. 

What is the best way to find a programmer/developer to partner with on this project of mine? I understand once I find an individual I will need to interview them and see if our interests are aligned, but I don’t know where to start finding the right programmer willing to partner with me. Are there any online forums? Developer groups (I am located in southern California) Would Craigslist be an option?

The problem is finding good programmers. Good programmers on the other hand are very picky too when it comes to finding good partner. Problem is, we programmers (I am one too) need to do some real hard work before the other partners can start doing their job. If we don't have the right partners we have done lots of work and wasted lots of time withouth any outcome. I have myself failed with one "partner" and now I have lost 4000 € in time and money even when the prototype is ready and could be used.

These days if I hear "i have a good idea and just need a programmer to deal with it" I run away, crying. It seems millions of people have "good ideas". They even don't care if 5 others have had the same idea. Sometimes they come even up telling me they have a good idea, which is basically like "Facebook". Not sure if I should laugh or cry at this time.

If you want me to invest my time, you need to convince me that you are a good partner. It is not the time that people are hiring developers. There is so much work out there... coders can choose. It is up to you to reach them and then to convince them to even listen to your idea.

Personally i listen to Twitter. If some of my friends are tweeting around that a reliable person is looking for help, I probably listen.

I look at interesting blogposts. Who wrote it? What does he do? Probably he is so serious he needs a guy like me? I even find out if the guy does a good job or not. I don't need a boss; I need somebody who knows how to do marketing, how to speak with people and how to organize things. Not how to make me more time pressure, I do that already myself.

Some offers i looked into came from personal recommendations (without web 2, really). 

The one i failed miserable was a posting on a user group i was into. Will never listen again. People who are so desperate to post to user groups are likely weird, I learned.

When I decided to listen, I don't want to listen on the phone. It costs me too much time (which i can waste at forums like this one ;-)). I ask the guy to send me a one-pager. On that one I mostly see if it is good or simply too much work (all facebook like social webapps return immediately). If the idea is good and I can't do it, I am likely to recommend a fellow. If the idea is good and I can do it, I will speak on the phone about it.

That being said, if you are good with managing your product in these days, convince people are a good at your job. Recruit via twitter, personal contacts, write interesting devs directly when you read their blog and so on. Have a one pager prepared. I had some contacts who wanted to wast an hour on the phone but were to lazy to prepare me an one pager. Nobody wants to cooperate with lazy and slow people, so be prepared.

You may want to look at www.stackoverflow.com  they have job postings.

Since you can't hire any of your project manager's people, maybe they can recommend someone or assist with the technical part of the interview?

Yes, a good programmer is hard to find because many people can masquerade as good programmers, particularly to someone who isn't one.  My suggestion would be to ask a few key questions based on the type of person who becomes a good programmer.  If someone touts their abilities with a particular language - they are not a good programmer because good programmers write in many languages and language knowledge is not the mark of a good programmer, coding style is.  If someone touts their ability to get help from their friends, they are not a good programmer because a good programmer can figure it out themselves.  If someone touts marketing skills or management skills, that is a dead give away to stay away because their skill is in talking the talk, not walking the walk.  So who does that leave, perhaps someone who just likes to program and does not have current money worries.

Might be worth attending some programming user groups.  If your demo for example is written with Ruby on Rails you may find a meetup / user group where some techies get together. Get to know some of the people, explain the idea you are working on, get a feel if there is any interest in your idea. 

It will be hard for you to get someone full time right away. I would suggest you find someone that can moonlight / part-time on your project for awhile to ensure they are a good fit and that they appear to know what they are doing. They need to be passionate about it and be excited at the opportunity that they can work on it full time when/if you bring up that option.  Also, equity is a good incentive... as long as they are genuinely interested in it. 

You could try and negotiate a better situation with your current company.  Setup a monthly retainer for $X,XXX for a block of time dedicated to your project.  Assuming they are doing a good job, having a 'team' immediately may be more of a benefit that having a single developer.  

There is a lot more that goes into an application than just programming. Typically you'll want someone with usability and creative experience as well.
