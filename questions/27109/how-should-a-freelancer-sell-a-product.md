I have a certain program that I would like to sell over the Internet world wide. 

Unfortunately, my country is not supported by PayPal when it comes to getting paid. I can only buy with PayPal. I am aware that there are other sites that let you charge credit cards from your customers and get paid, but I would really like to know what is the legal procedure here (besides opening/registering your company).

What works best in practice?

Maybe I should try selling the program over some company, to let them do the selling for me. In that case would I leave them a percentage?

I am not seeking legal advice, just an experience of people who are freelancers and are selling their software over net.

Contact a similar successful business from your local area to see what works for them.

Many times people are willing to help others out, especially if you're not going to be in direct competition with them.

**Contact a Lawyer** 

Now that that is said, there isn't a whole lot more we can say because laws are different from country to country.

Reflect on what you goal is -- is your goal to become a business owner managing not only the development of the product but also marketing, sales, service and support.

If your long term direction is to build a development company with a healthy product portfolio that has a target market that defines it -- then it might make sense. 

Base on my experience I would recommend you fully explore the idea of partnering with an existing company. Sign a limited sales/distribution agreement with performance measures. 

Be sure that as part of the agreement you do get a way to have the "customer" list-- this will be important for you moving forward.

Each country is different but consider getting someone else to sell it for you, there is a lot of work that goes into the selling side and using something like component source or similar to promote and collect the money for you, then pay in a single payment could be your easiest path.
