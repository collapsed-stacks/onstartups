Ten years ago I formed an S-Corp in Maryland with myself as the sole shareholder and director.  Unfortunately I didn't have a handle on making all the required tax filings and payments, and the company's charter was forfeited, even as the business grew.

Now, after spending many thousands of dollars I have caught up on *all* back paperwork and taxes, and am ready to file articles of revival.  The problem is that the Maryland guidelines say this:

> "An individual who held more than one office in the corporation prior to its forfeiture cannot execute the articles in more than one capacity unless the corporation is a close corporation or a professional service corporation."

What is meant by "close corporation" is that some states (including Maryland) have a special designation for closely-held companies, which exempts them from having to observe most corporate formalities such as board meetings, minutes, etc.

The Catch 22 is this:  I can't file the articles of revival until I have filed the election to become a close corporation.  And, I can't file the election to become a close corporation until the corporation has been revived, because it's currently not a legally-recognized entity.

One thing which has been suggested to me is to get a second person to temporarily sign the articles of revival as a director, revive the charter, and then remove them.  But, wouldn't that be placing a certain amount of liability and/or risk on that person's shoulders, for the period of time that they are a director?  I wouldn't want to do that to someone without them being fully informed as to what they were getting into.

I can't afford a lawyer, as it took every last penny to pay the back taxes.  And, the state won't answer any questions - they actually hang up the phone on incoming calls(!)  I am trying to work through this on my own.  Thus, I *greatly* appreciate any advice or suggestions others may have.

If you've been operating all these years without an active corporation, then your business has been operating de facto as a sole proprietorship (or general partnership if you have multiple owners) with unlimited liability towards your personal assets. Therefore the business' assets, ip, and even trademarks acquired/developed from the time the corporation's charter went inactive belong to you as a sole proprietor, which you can reassign to a new corporate entity. Note, however, that there may be tax consequences to assigning now-valuable business assets to a new corporate entity and that you may have to correct erroneous tax returns that were filed in the name of the inactive corporate entity (fortunately, since you made an S-Election, you had pass-through tax treatment so the tax owed would have matched that of a sole-proprietorship). When was your corporation officially "forfeited"?

Is it as simple as having this person sign an agreement that they will resign the position and surrender ownership to you upon a certain date after the revival is complete?

There are probably legal/tax implications to research but an agreement should be a good safeguard.

I don't see what the risk would be if someone just signed the document and resigned, and wasn't appointed as a corporate officer.  Can't the person sign as an "Authorized Signatory" or the like?

There is no risk adding a person as an independent director. For that person to be liable you have to really be doing shady stuff. As a director they are covered under the corporate veil, which is next to impossible to pierce in most states.
