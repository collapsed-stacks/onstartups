I am an owner of popular website, devoted to services for learning of English words. This market is a very competitive, but we have small growth. I want to establish a company in the United States, but I have no local friends or partners yet. Could you recommend a bulletin board, web site, exhibition, conference or something else to represent my project to find a partner in the U.S. Time frame is autumn 2010. Preferable location is New England, especially Massachusetts.

<p>Based on the time and location, I suggest you check out the Business of Software conference which is on Boston, MA, October 4 - 6, 2010.</p>

I'm based in the U.S. (San Francisco) and I might be interested (I've toyed with the idea of making SuperMemo-like language learning software in the past). Send me an e-mail to discuss in more detail ( http://blog.kowalczyk.info)
