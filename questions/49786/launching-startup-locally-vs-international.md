I have a site I am launching within the next couple of weeks. The site will be providing a service to connect people locally within there region (city,state etc..).

**The question is, should I launch a US only service vs Internationally? Why or why not?**

I am leaning to launch locally, aka within the US, and not globally. It seams like a lot of US start-ups work this way as well, getting feedback from there very local launches that are confined to a city or state, or the US in General.

For product based businesses I understand the reasoning behind this as they have a physical product to ship and logistics quickly become an issue.

Though for a online software service is there any reason why I should just confine my self to the USA?

<p>You should launch <strong>with a narrow focus</strong>. That may be a narrow geographical scope (one smaller city), or perhaps just a narrow vertical (a segment with a shared interest or occupation).</p>

<p>When launching a startup like that, you're looking for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect" rel="nofollow">specific aspect of network effects</a>: You're looking for <em>new users to be drawn into the service</em> because the <em>network value of the already existing user base</em> is large enough. When done correctly, this can lead to a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle -- but it requires a certain critical initial mass.</p>

<p>Therefore you should start with a narrow focus, on a specific segment of users to whom you can provide real value, in order to obtain critical mass.</p>

<p>It's a worn metaphor, but still true: Think of how Facebook initially concentrated on college kids, and since expanded outside that initial segment.</p>

I would say there are two reasons for staying local. Business and logistics.

Business: You do not know if this site is going to be a success. You don't know what the best/worst features are and you don't know if there is a proven market for your product. Even if you have done research in the US I doubt you have much global market data. You can always expand if the market is there or the site takes off. 

Logistically: Will your site be as valuable to non English speakers? Do you have the resources to support a global customer/visitor base? Do you have the time to spend making it global?

**You can always expand and your new markets will thank you but give them a bad product the first time around and they'll never forgive you.**
