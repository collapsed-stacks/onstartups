What are the 5 must-do basic things to have a shot at being marginally successful on a first day web site launch? The measure of success is defined (in our case) as at least having:

1) 50000 hits on the first day, 
2) 10,000 Unique Visitors
3) Avg time on Site: 3 min

If the above 3 things are accomplished, it would be a success on our first day

Please feel free to suggest/comment

<blockquote>"If you build it, congratulations, but don’t expect too much. If you build it, market it, support it, monitor its publicity, and keep improving it, then they will come, slowly, in fives and tens. Each new subscription is proof that you’re getting somewhere. The trick is ensuring constant growth, and that takes hard work."</blockquote>

From my personal experience I'd recommend reading this article on <a href="http://www.contrast.ie/blog/patience-and-hard-work/">patience and hard work</a>.
