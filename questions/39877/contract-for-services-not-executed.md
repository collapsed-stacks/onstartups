We're a small start-up with a written and signed contact for services with a large company.  The contact is for professional services and has no official start-date but the terms are 1 year with opportunity to re-new.  The large company has been avoiding communications with us and employees of the large company have been told not to respond to our phone calls and emails.  This has been going on for over 2 months, which is a life time for a start-up.

This contract is very large and was the big reason we started our business.  We are unsure what our next steps should be.  Here are our thoughts....

Should we **forget it, fail fast and move on** *or* **seek legal action** in some form?

The issue with seeking legal action is the legal fees and who we are up against; it's billion dollar company.  Moving on is a huge blow to the moral of the team and essentially we are starting from zero.

Ultimately I suspect you're going to have to move on. A legal case will take a lot of time and money, as you say -- and would probably sap the morale of the team just as much as, if not more than, moving on.

Do BigCo perhaps have competitors (ideally smaller, hungrier ones) who might benefit from work similar to what you've already done?
