How is the correct way to contact a company, and show the services I provide?
Is a first telephone call the best way, or I need to avoid this and invest more in ads waiting interested companies enter in contact?

I think telephone call a invasive approach, but it seems the major companies do this way.

You should personally try to rapidly test as many sales/marketing approaches as possible. The key is to reach the right people, at the right time, and with the right message. You might be surprised, but under the right circumstances, people are happy to get a cold call. The key is doing research, understanding your market, and the person you're calling.

Just pick up the phone and call 100 people, you have nothing to lose by trying it.
