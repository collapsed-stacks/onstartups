We are planing to start a StreamServe consulting firm in Singapore. I would like to know, is it legal to use StreamServe in the website we are planing to launch for this consulting work.

I haven't seen any company using streamServe in their website who are doing the consulting work for StreamServe.

Your are not infringing copyright by using the name, as this type of activity falls into trademark law. Some basic due dilligence

 1. do you see (R) or TM anywhere after the name?
 2. if so need to be scrupulous in following similarly
 3. otherwise so long as not using it to deceive such as typosquatting domainname

... then you can use the name as in ordinary usage. Also helps if there's an official affiliate program (or even authorised distributor) as they may provide you legal cover + goodies. This is how names fall into common usage (actually legally speaking get diluted) which is why we Xerox a copy or google friends. Of course, given the limitations of human vocabulary even after neologisms, sooner or later every word-combo will be locked up to some extent or another. The main point of trademark law is to avoid deceptive conduct like passing off.
