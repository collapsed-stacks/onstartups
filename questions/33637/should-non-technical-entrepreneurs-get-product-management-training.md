**So this is my case:**

**1)** I don't know programming

**2)** I don't know much about product management

**3)** I don't have a team nor do I have a prototype/idea yet.

**So would I be better off :**

**a)** training myself about product management 

**b)** Or should I go out and look for technical-founders instead of doing this training.

I am talking about 
product management (agile and non-agile) training 
which companies like http://280group.com 
provide (not programming training):

1) **Agile PM:** http://www.280group.com/training/certifications/agile-self-study-course-certification/

2) **Non-Agile PM:** http://www.280group.com/training/certification-self-study-coursesexams/certified-project-manager-course-exam/

**What you think ?**

I think it would be a waste of time/money.  I have done this course, and whilst I learnt a couple of things from it, I think it's the sort of thing that you would do to have on your resume more than for the knowledge learnt.  If you want knowledge, read a book or two, you will save a lot of money and learn more (I would recommend learning about scrum, not that I suggest it's the best methodology, but it would be very though provoking and of a similar vein to the course).

Also not that you asked, what exactly are you planning to bring to the party? Startups are hard, they are hard when you are skilled in the field.  You are lowering your chances by not having expertise in this area.  I would gain a relevant skill set before trying to get into the startup game, and I don't mean a 2 day course, I mean really get some expertise either in your spare time or professionally if you can.  Get yourself to a point where you can justify your value in the team.

Just to elaborate on the key point Joel touched on, you can bring one of 4 things to a startup:

 1. Skills
 2. Idea(s)
 3. Money
 4. People

If you're bring none of these, there's no course in the world that can correct this. I would say go and work for someone else for at least 3-5 years and review your position then.
