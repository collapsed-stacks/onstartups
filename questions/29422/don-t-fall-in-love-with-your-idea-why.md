I was wondering why do people suggest to not fall in love with idea. Is it so that we take criticism positively and don't get emotional at times or something?

But to me, it also looks like one positive advantage of falling in love with idea could be that one will work more passionately. 

Has someone experienced the negative effects of falling in love with idea?!

It's good to be passionate about your idea. The advice "don't fall in love with your idea" means don't become too attached to it. Be willing to change or abandon your idea if it later becomes clear that this is the best course of action.

Emotions prevent you from acting rational. Also, it is more painful to deal with a failure of the idea you felt in love with. Love motivates you but it can not be a long term strategy. It would be better to have a plan and put your passion in reaching some small and realistic milestones.

<p><strong>Falling in</strong> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gOoZr.gif" alt="enter image description here"> with your idea is <strong>good</strong></p>

<p>but it could also mean</p>

<ol>
<li>You won't know when to give it up</li>
<li>You'll be afraid of handing over control when it's warranted</li>
<li>You will take input you don't agree with about your product as a
personal attack</li>
<li>point number 3 will cause animosity and a barrier between you and
the rest of your team</li>
<li>You'll ignore trends and be resistant to change</li>
<li>see point #1</li>
<li><strong>see point #1 again</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I spent 4 years of my life on a failing startup, an idea and product I was obsessed with and in retrospect got almost nothing out of it. Don't let it happen to you. But at least I'll know what to do next time around :)</p>

Fall in love with the vision, not the idea. Pivot with the idea whenever you need to.

The benefit of falling in love with your idea is that it keeps you warm and you have something to hug.

Let the sun and your love shine on your ideas to make them bright and shiny. This will make your life prosper and successful. Lack of love is lack of passion.

Love is the way to the heart to your customer. Passion follows to embrace the tender connection to your userbase. If you fill the remaining space with hugs and kisses, money will flow.

And perhaps, more relevant questions will also flow out from you.

I think you have to "love" or have genuine passion for what you are doing and have to have some conviction that your idea will work. I am reminded here of the book "The Monk and the Riddle" about what makes the best entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.

However, there is a big difference between this and obstinacy, which is based more on narcissism. So be careful that your ego isn't getting in the way of figuring out how your idea is going to work in practice.

On a more metaphysical level, there is some letting go involved in entrepreneurship. At some point, serendipity, God, "infinite intelligence" will also help you get where you want to go so long as what you are doing is not all about you.
