I want to approach a former colleague to be a strategic partner on a software project. He would be bringing key skills to the table that I frankly can't afford to pay an employee for. I was considering offering him equity but after reading [Joel Spolsky's excellent answer on partners and equity][1] I've decided against it because he is not a founder or working full-time on the project and therefore not worthy of an equal stake. And, I'm sure with a minority stake he will eventually become "dead weight" (Joel's words).

Since I cannot pay him salary, what are my performance-based alternatives to equity? Any suggestions on what to offer him? BTW he is an executive at a very large technology company, if that is important.

Thanks in advance...

Offer equity that is contingent on this person making the expected contribution. Some sort of vesting schedule. Include some contract that allows you to buy him out at a certain time. This way, future investors will not be worried about your team being stuck with someone who has outlived their usefulness and is going to hold you hostage when they discover you're getting funding. Don't give them the option.

An executive should understand this.
