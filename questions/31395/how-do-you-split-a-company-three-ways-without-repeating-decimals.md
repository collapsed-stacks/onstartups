My co-founders and I have agreed on a completely even split equity of 1/3 each. In our operating agreement,however, we need to put down the percentage ownership stake for each of us, and aren't exactly sure how we're supposed to account for a repeating decimal.

Do we need to give someone a 33.34%, or is there a way we can maintain a completely even split?

Ha. It's actually very easy: issue the **same number of shares** to all three founders.

For instance, each founder gets one million shares. Obviously, they all have the same chunk of the company (one third). And yes, it can't be expressed as a finite number in percentages, but that's ok, because what matters is the number of stocks.

A) You're obsessing over totally wrong stuff right now.

B) You can issue any arbitrary number of shares for your company.  Issue 3 shares and give each founder 1, or issue 3,000,000 and give each founder 1,000,000.

Seriously? Use fractions instead of decimals. You each have a 1/3 stake.

Split the company four ways: 1 for each partner and one for the company itself.  It will pay for itself.  Or perhaps you could split it 20%, 20%, 20%, 40% :)

There is no way you can divide 100 into 3 and get 3 equal pieces w/out each being 33.333 recurring. That is basic mathematics.
