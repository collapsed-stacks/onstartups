I am just started my business, so I am trying to figure out the nuts and bolts of it.

I am a single member LLC, but I plan to take more people on board as members in the days to come. When I make an investment from my savings into the company, how do I make it official? This is especially a concern if I make a cash deposit instead of a cheque.

Thanks!

Very good concern. Cash appearing out of thin air and becoming ownership stake in a company may lead to questions from the tax authorities. If the questions aren't that difficult to answer - deposit the cash in the personal account, and write a check. If the questions are too tough for you to handle - run away and hide.
