My company makes and sells computers for Autodesk software, so Structural Engineers, 3D designers etc.

Where would be best to advertise? We have an adwords campaign running, but we are only spending about £5 a day since we are so targeted!
We don't want to use the keyword 'computers' etc. because that is too generic and we would be wasting money.

We have looked into magazine advertising, like a structural engineers magazine, but do you think that was have a good ROI for computer sales?

Our budget is £3000, and if it doesn't work then we are going to have to shut the company down.

We are experts when it comes to computers, but we know NOTHING about marketing!

Any help appreciated.

Honestly, forget about using adwords. There is obviously not the volume you need.

You need to ask yourself "Where do engineers go to find information about software?" (I'll give you a clue - it's not Facebook or Twitter.) Talk to a few. They will soon tell you.

Places you could try looking at are:

 - Sponsoring Industry association events
 - Trade shows (when you grow your budget)
 - Industry magazines
 - Direct mail
 - Phone calls and meetings

Don't just stick it on the internet and expect sales to come rolling in. You need to get out there into the industry. 

If you really believe in your product, then you need to market it effectively to give it a chance to take off. Your marketing budget should be adequate to test if there is some interest. If there is, you need to grow your budget and do what it takes to get the funds to market it.

This is all providing that you have already talked to your potential customers and know that they want what you've got.

<p>We thought of starting business of selling website logos online few months back. Apart from logo designers, we needed web designers &amp; SEO specialist team. And typically we required many other resources. Google adwords campaign seemed to be right idea to start with and we initially set our budget approximately 10,000$ a month. Our management was formulating this plan for a long time, however I was not actively engaged in this program.</p>

<p>After giving it many thoughts, our management could not see its existence if the adwords campaign was not able generate the type of revenue we were expecting. Finally, we left this idea.</p>

<p>Not an every person is expert on Google Adwords. Its a bit difficult program as far as results are concerned. Even professional tests are being conducted by google and then they are awarded certificate for google adwords qualification. What I like to advise you in brief is that you should hire a <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords/professionals/index.html" rel="nofollow">certified google adwords</a> campaign runner or go with organic SEO. Research for right SEO Company, evaluate their credibility &amp; wait until you get more visitors.</p>

<p>Otherwise <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/users/2737/susan-jones">Susan Jones</a> has given the right ideas that you should consider.</p>

Advertise on facebook.  You can then target people by their profession and interests.  It's very hard to do that on any other platform.
