I have a new site and I need to make a quick video tutorial for new users.

The debate in the past has seemed to revolve around using either Camtasia or IshowU.  But which one do I go with?  Camtasia is $300, do I really need to spend that much to create a good video?

What service did 37signals use to create this? http://backpackit.com/examples#videos/makepage_video

I'd prefer to use a PC friendly service, but I do have access to a MAC as well.

Any advice for me?

Microsoft MediaEncoder, special codec settings for screen capture. Free download at MS, creates WMV files. Done that,worked like charm. Free.

I've been using CamStudio open source and it's quite OK - depends on the level of sophistication you need.

Jing is free and quite easy to use.

Camtasia makes it easy to edit your videos after recording, panning/zooming, cutting out your "um"s etc.  You can also export in a wide variety of sizes, formats, and qualities.  I recommend that you try the 30-day demo before laying out $300 though.  

Jing could be a good interim solution, I've seen lots of great presentations using it.

I have tried almost all screencasting solution for windows and nothing can be compared to Camtasia. It's not free but IMHO is well worth the investment.

As suggested, use 30 days trial to make an informed decision.

I use personally use Camtasia, but Screenr is another freemium option not mentioned yet that you may want to check out.
