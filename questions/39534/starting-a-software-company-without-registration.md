I want to sell a software product. I would like to use a brand name e.g. mysoftcompany in the EULA (End User License Agreement) and in the contact details of webpage. So that the software is sold under a name of a company. 

*Is it necessary to register such a company before using it since I have no office or physical establishment?*

If this is not possible, can I use the name of my website e.g. mycompany.com instead of my name in the license?

Registering a business and have an office are two unrelated issues. If you want to use a name, then you can either use your own (so you are personally assuming ownership of any and all agreements and liabilities resulting from your activities), or you can create a business (in which case the business would assume the same, pursuant to the nature of the business structure you create).

If you are going to sell *anything* and have any kind of EULA, you should probably form a business entity to own that work. This has benefits both from a liability perspective (what if your software has unintended consequences to a user and you get sued) and from a revenue perspective (tax planning).

State law provides the rules on use of business names and assumed names and they vary from state to state.  To use a business name, which indicates a business entity, you most likely will need to register the business.  You can probably do business as yourself (or as a business entity) under an assumed name, but you will need to file a DBA (Doing Business As).    

Using a name other than your personal name without registering it as a business or filing a DBA is probably against the law in your state.  

Note that registering a company or filing a DBA means your state will permit you to do business under that name.  Your state permitting you to do business under a name does not mean that you have a right to use that name under federal copyright and trademark law.  That is a separate issue.
