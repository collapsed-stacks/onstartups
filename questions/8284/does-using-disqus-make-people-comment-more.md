I am feeling the effect of seeing DISQUS on certain blogs in that it makes me more likely to comment. Is this true for others here? Does any blog/site owner have data on increased comment counts after using DISQUS?

I don't have stats, but I know that when I visit a site that uses Disqus I'm more likely to comment. I hate filling in the personal information form repeatedly, and this way, my comments always link back to my site, and I can keep track of all my comments in one place.

Actually for me more the most important factor to comment is valuable or interesting information for me.  When i see it, i comment and even try to share with others. The second factor is a blogger, who has earned good reputation and write precious info, share His knowledge. I think whether the site uses Disqus or no, there's no difference

Disqus versus requiring people to make accounts on your site. Disqus will win out.
Versus anonymous comments I'm not sure, but anonymous comments usually require capture or something annoying.

Disqus uses JavaScript embed code and the comment content won't be indexed by search engines on your page. That may or may not be important to you but it's something worth considering.

"Does using DISQUS make people comment more?"

Compared to what? Using an embedded commenting system or using nothing?

My opinion: enterprise-class discussion solutions make commenting **more** difficult for users because they tend to be very slow compared to embedded commenting systems and tend to have bugs in different browsers due to imperfect implementations across different sites. Also, registration for comments is (in my opinion) quite overkill - a person may only feel moved to comment once in a great while, so requiring the user to remember a site registration address and password that they registered to the same blog 2 years or 6 months ago is a bit much to ask. Captcha based solutions + ad hoc commenting are much more appropriate to comments than registration. 

When I see Disqus or one of their competitors I tend to not post a comment. 

Discussion boards are a different matter. 

Also, some sites are adopting Facebook comments in order to force non-anonymity. If you absolutely must have registration, I'd personally lean toward the FB solution, because most users will have that already.

It's true for me because I like the design of disqus. Any other commentating system with a similar design would encourage me as well.

It is a great system. We are using it on a site and we are now receiving many more comments. Spam isn't an issue either. We recommend it to anyone who needs a commenting system.
