I have a store within a computer sales center and because of some problems it has been empty until now. The problems are now solved, and I want to open it and use it as a place to do programming. I love programming, and I'm trying hard to become a professional programmer.

Everybody says programming does not need a place like this and you can just rent a room in an apartment to do your work.

What kind of place should I start in?

<p>I worked with a company that started out with as a computer repair and network company and then eventually transitioned to programming (more money and lower costs) as computer sales become more and more commoditized through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell" rel="nofollow">Dell</a> and other brand companies. Through the 10-year process we went from small website construction to custom software development and then eventually added the website business back on once technology helped to make it more economical, software like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress" rel="nofollow">WordPress</a>. </p>

<p>Everything comes down to what you want to do and how to maximize your business potential. With our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar" rel="nofollow">brick and mortar</a> location we had a lot of walk-ins asking for help with their general software and hardware problems. We received enough business to keep three people employed. We placed signs and marketing on our physical location to encourage walk-in traffic.</p>

<p>Another advantage to having a physical place was it was nice to host client meetings in our custom software business. If you have employees it's nice to have standup meetings and other meetings all in the same physical room. </p>

<p>On the downside, owning a physical shop costs money - sometimes quite a bit of money as you may already know. If you really want to be a custom software shop (as a developer you probably want that) then having a physical place is likely an expense you don't need. Meet with clients at their office or at a coffee shop, use phone / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype" rel="nofollow">Skype</a> to hold regular meetings with staff, and, as you know, the work itself is done via the computer which can be anywhere.</p>

<p>I would suggest building a decent client base first (call them your early adopters). Then once you've gained enough regular cash flow, revisit a physical location. If you find that it's not necessary to expand then don't bother with it.</p>
