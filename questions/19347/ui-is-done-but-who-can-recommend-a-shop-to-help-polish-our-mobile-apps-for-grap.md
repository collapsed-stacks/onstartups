We have finished the user-flow for our mobile apps but they can use some polish for branding purposes. It seems like it would be helpful to work with a firm that has experience specifically designing graphics for the iPhone and Android. Can anyone please help with some recommendations. Thanks!

<p>At a meet up last week the founder of <a href="http://www.geckoboard.com/" rel="nofollow">geckoboard</a> was praising the firm that did their design (which is a really nice interface). It may be worth dropping him an email and asking for contact details. (I did have a quick look on the geckoboard blog but didn't see anything there).</p>

<p>Contact Joe Strout at <a href="http://luminaryapps.com/" rel="nofollow">Luminary Apps</a>. They have a solid team working on commercial iPhone and Android apps. I'm not affiliated with Luminary. I've known Joe professionally for many years. We're working with Luminary on our mobile apps.</p>
