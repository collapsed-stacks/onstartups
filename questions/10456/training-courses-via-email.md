We are going to have different training courses delivered via email with each session a day. A user can come to the site and select lets say Course A that can start either from the same day or next day he signed up on. Then the application is supposed to send him one email a day that will contain a training session until that course is over. The challenging part is that we will have number of different courses available and users can sign up anytime for one or more courses and the application is required to manage all of dynamic scheduling and delivery of these training courses via email.

Is there any solution available that will allow us do it?
