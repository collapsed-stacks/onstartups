### How much would it cost to let an engineer develope a tablet like touch device for me? And how to find one?

I only need a ballpark estimate for calculating. I have no idea about the costs of a development like this.

**technical facts**

- big eInk display
- finger and pen touch
- simple small OS without apps or browser
- wifi to sync with PC
- super small
- no cam or something like this.

Would be also nice to have some fact about development costs of known tablets or ebook readers.
