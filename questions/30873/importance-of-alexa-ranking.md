<p><a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites" rel="nofollow">Alexa</a> measures how 'popular' your site is, mainly based on the number of page impressions (page views) you have.</p>

<p>So having a high position on Alexa's ranking roughly corresponds to having many visitors -- which is always a good thing. But you don't 'do things' that improve Alexa ranking in order to gain success. You 'do things' that gain you success, and then your Alexa ranking automatically increases.</p>

Alexa site traffic measure is not accurate and worthy enough because;

- Alexa counts traffic stats based on the searches and page visits from those users who have already installed Alexa Toolbar
- Alexa collects real-time visits-data from ISPs as well

On the other hand, Google PR is comparatively more accurate than Alexa because it collects information from every site on the internet and assigns a PR based on numerous ranking factors embedded in its algorithm.

If you want to test Alexa accuracy, just install Alexa toolbar and keep visiting your website for about 50+ times in a day. This exercise will help you shoot up your Alexa Traffic Rank in just one week :)

But on a serious note; if you are getting traffic from external resources, more potential leads are being generated and subscribers are converting into customers then it all all you should care about. If you are losing traffic, spent your energies on SEO and search engine marketing technique rather than relying on stats given by Alexa or any other relative tools.

Alexa isn't important. "Conversions" are. (A conversion being something that you wanted your customer to do). As Jasper mentioned if you get more visits to your site, your Alexa ranking will go up. However I'd spend more time working on squeezing the "juice" from each visitor and opitimising my site to do so with A/B testing and building sales funnels.

Take 2 scenarios

1) 1,000 visits a day and you get 10 "conversions" (sales /  sign ups / enquiries / bookings whatever). Nice Alexa Ranking too. 

2) 200 visits a day and you get 20 "conversions" ... Much better.. but no where on Alexa. 

I find most SEO companies, marketing companies are only about option 1) ... That's useless. Option 2) is way more profitable... but takes more work, knowledge and dedication.

Everyone can see an Alexa rank... No one but the site owner will know (if they track) what the conversion numbers are.

Focus on conversions :)

Assuming the fact that you are a blogger and you might use adsense to monetize your site, Alexa becomes important to you as it gives you a motivation to keep pushing hard. Once you cross that "New Blogger" Tag it will never be a significant thing to you as that will anyways be good for you.
