On the iTunes Connect iAd agreement it states

"I declare that the beneficial owner does not have any employees in the United States and does not own, lease or control any equipment or other assets in the United States that are used to derive revenue from the iAd Network"

My company is a legal corporation in the UK, and consists of four directors (not employees) who were originally in the UK but two of which now study in the US. Legally speaking, does that mean I have "equipment or assets" in the US as they help created the app?

It sounds like Apple is trying to make sure that you do not have a [nexus](http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/glossaryn/g/nexusdef.htm) in the United States which would subject your transactions to US tax. It sounds like you don't.
