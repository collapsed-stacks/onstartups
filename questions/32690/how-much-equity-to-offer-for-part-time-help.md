I worked on a web site idea for the last 1 1/2 years, created the prototype, have spent money incorporating and other legal stuff, etc., etc. Now, to launch I need help, thus started talking with people working in areas I need help.

One person was enthusiastic about the idea and had started helping me (primarily in the area of servers, security, deployment/data center configuration, so on). This is not a major time consuming exercise, and with his expertise, he could do it in short order. He is very busy in his full-time job.

However, I do see this person as someone who really trusts the idea, and can contribute in general and not just in areas I mentioned above.

I have to formally bring him into the fold (as an employee, I guess). It is an equity offer (I am not in a position to pay him anything). My question is - how much equity is right here? I see potential ways he can help, but at this time 'potential' is the key word.

 - Offer equity but with vesting over time
 - Just because you see this person as valuable right now, doesn't mean there isn't someone else who can do the same thing. So, offer small equity.
 - If this person really cares, "trusts" the product/startup, relatively small equity with vesting will promise great returns and be enough for them.
