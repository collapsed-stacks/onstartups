Maybe this is a silly question, but credit for being "employee #1" seems to matter a lot.  So if I'm the CEO, and the idea was originally mine, but I'm launching the start-up with my CTO, and we've both committed simultaneously, and we're 50/50 partners economically, am I employee #1 and he's #2?  Or are we BOTH #1?  Is there a convention here?

You're obsessing on the wrong things.

I would say employee #1 is the first guy you jointly hire to join your company.

An approach that tech folks can appreciate:  make your CTO employee #0, and you be employee #1.

But as other posters have noted, you're both "co-founders".

You two are founders, the first moron you hire is employee #1.

I prefer "WE are employee #1".

"Who has the biggest?"
"Who was there first?"

The answer is simple. If two people founded the company, each one of them is a "co-founder" and there is no single Uber-Founder.

Apart from personal fame, what are you trying to achieve? I would be more interested in pleasing my co-founder than the general public. I'm a co-founder and the CEO, if the CTO wanted to be #1, he's welcome, I owe him somewhat more than the faceless millions.
