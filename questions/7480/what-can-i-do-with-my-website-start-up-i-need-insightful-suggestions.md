I have created a novel website. Now it comes to the promotion/marketing stage. However,I don't dare spend money promoting/marketing my website because I am not sure whether it can succeed or fail. What if it fail? Then I lose my money and I will be put in an adverse/touch position and maybe I have to work many years to pay back this amount of money then this loan will become a big burden on my life. It will affect my later life and my ideals. I may work very hard throughout the day. Then I will be deprived of my personal life. I will become a slave.

If I go to work, I can imagine that it is very boring and it is a treadmill. I can not earn much money, I will be wasting my life. I will become dull after years of working and I will become a common/uninteresting person.

I am not sure whether my website will succeed or not. I don't know. I am not confident of it. I am quite indecisive. Help me!

<p>Your website URL please? It is hard to give relevant opinion without clear idea of your product and target market.</p>

<p>In general, if you can't spend a lot of money on marketing, then you can choose to <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating%5Fpassionate%5Fusers/2005/09/you%5Fcan%5Foutspen.html" rel="nofollow">out-teach</a> your competitions or say something interesting. Make yourself discoverable. <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/" rel="nofollow">37signals</a>, <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/2008/07/30/10000-in-revenue-in-the-first-6-weeks/" rel="nofollow">Balsamiq</a>, <a href="http://onstartups.com/" rel="nofollow">Hubspot</a> and <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/" rel="nofollow">OkCupid</a> do a good job at this.</p>

<p>I heard a lot of good story about this book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470499311" rel="nofollow">Inbound Marketing</a> so you might want to check it out. Disclaimer: I haven't read it. </p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

Taking your startup to the next level is something you must feel strongly about if you want to pursue it. Try taking a couple days to think about it.

Ask yourself if doing this is something you see great potential in, if you can see yourself investing the majority of your time in for at least several years. Definitely do not decide to move forward with the project halfheartedly putting yourself at much greater risk...
