You could do case studies, testimonials and product snapshots and provide a bridge to the team, about us and why us pages. 

Alternatively you could add a subject matter blog or QA site similar to the one we are all on.

Ultimately the idea for a site is to present your portfolio and generate leads. A content rich deep and growing site will do a much better job  of doing both than a static collection of pages.

I recommend that your primary marketing platform would be a really effective iphone/andoid application. 

Then all the website needs to have is:

 1. Download of the application
 1. Contact Information
 1. Gallery of other applications authored.

Of course you could do a traditional site of case studies, testimonials, over view of services, link to a blog, company profile, interesting stuff about the market. . . . but that is well, so ho-hum when you could demonstrate your skill and the power of your chosen medium by, well -- using it!

<p>You can use these services to create dedicated content for each of your smartphone apps:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://app.net" rel="nofollow">app.net</a></li>
<li><a href="http://approid.me/home.aspx" rel="nofollow">approid.me</a></li>
<li><a href="http://appmark.it/welcome" rel="nofollow">appmark.it</a></li>
</ul>
