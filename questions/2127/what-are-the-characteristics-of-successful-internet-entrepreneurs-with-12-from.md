An ability to compartmentalize disappointment. 

It is ineveitable as entrepreneurs that disappointment will visit us in one form or another...almost on a daily basis. I believe an ability to put disappointments into the right perspective, and then move on, is a much required trait for a successful internet enterepreneur.

I have seen too many entrepreneurs and even public company CEO's let the most incidental disappointments rock their confidence and prevent them from thinking in a productive/creative way.

As a former personal trainer of many CEO's, I had the opportunity to study which ones seemed to steadily move forward, even in the face of an onslaught of disappointments. (specifically quite a few real estate moguls)

Those that were able to compartmentalize a bad meeting, a broken deal, a rogue employee, etc. are still around to fight the fight today.

Leadership -- If you grow, you need to be able to hire a team, convey your vision, and lead them in implementing it.

Luck -- Being at the right place at the right time goes a long way towards making you successful. It's not something that you can make happen but it's important to recognize how luck affected some of the most successful entrepreneurs.

Since the entrepreneur road is a pretty risky one, I think Optimism is an essential characteristic.  It also helps with handling the inevitable setbacks.

While nothing can absolutely ensure success, there are two key traits that dramatically increase the odds for success for an entrepreneur:

• An unbridled passion for a business concept that fills a specific market need and that you can deliver a product or service that meets that need.  

• Near-religious zeal for managing your cash, with cash generation as your primary focus at all times.

Only two, but the most powerful of any you can bring to your endeavor.  And the ones that will most contribute to your ultimate success. If you can achieve them, you can succeed!

Probably opportunism per the list above. I think it's about really identifying an opportunity and the potential and knowing how to figure that out. So often you see ideas that you think, huh? Who's going to want that? The great ones have a great ability to figure out what the market will want.
