I believe one of the hardest and most important things that will help a company to be successful is what name you put to that company. The name should be easy to remember and retain on customer's mind. Any recommendation on the amount of syllables the name should have?

Pick a name that is easy to spell, unique, and memorable. 

Don't spend your time surfing for available domain names, you'll tear your hair out and pick a worse name as a result. Focus on good names for your business. Then when you have the name focus on a domain name for it. You will build your brand recognition, loyalty, and company name through your actions and products, not through your domain name.

Nothing worse than having a friend tell you "you'll want to check out doppler, it's spelled d-o-p-p-l-r-dot-com, leave the e out". Dopplr may own a catchy dot-com but how sad that everyone has to explain how it's spelled. Even a Google search for doppler doesn't turn up the dopplr.com website near the top because the word doppler is not in their product name or on their website. Dopplr's business named based on domain availability is a liability.

Compare that with a great name but compromised domain like this: "you'll want to checkout campfirenow-dot-com".  Campfire is a memorable product name and the domain is an easy to spell domain name that I'll either type right on the first try or if I forget the "now" a simple google search for campfire on Google returns campfirenow.com because the word campfire is actually in the product name. Campfire and campfirenow.com are assets.

Two.

Unless of course the memorable name, the name that fits your product, the name that communicate your value, the name which matches the available url, the name which you can trademark, the name which connects with your customers *isn't* two syllables. 

In fact -- two may not be right at all. Maybe it is three. Or one. Or **maybe you shouldn't choose a memorable name appropriate for your company by the number of syllables?**

we're looking at the same thing. 
we decided not to have a pun or anything that assumes a street level command of english, to cater for foreign markets
a lot depends on what your target market is and how much marketing budget you can put in. for mass market, best to have names that convey emotions or that refer to things. e.g. silent night, snow & rock, holiday villas.
it is worth testing your names by someone who has a bit of perspective
