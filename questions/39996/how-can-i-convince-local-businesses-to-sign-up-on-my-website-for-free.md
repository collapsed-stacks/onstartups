I've recently launched a website and I need to sign up as many local businesses as I can on it. The website is currently only available for local businesses in Ontario, Canada only. There are a few issues with signing up local businesses on my website (even if it's free to signup):

 1. Some business owners/managers don't know how to use computers but most of their **customers** do.
 2. Some business owners/managers don't want to spend the time to list their products and information on my website but customers don't want to see a **bare-bones** business profile.
 3. Some business owners/managers have their own websites and they feel that their own website is sufficient enough for them to get local customers.

The website focuses around local businesses (mainly restaurants and shops) and without local businesses, customers don't see any value to sign up on it. Similarly, without any customers, local businesses don't see any value of signing up either. How can I solve this chicken & egg problem?

1. Don't just make calls to random businesses in your area but instead, go sistematicaly. For example, firstly call all the hairdressers and when you'r finished, start with butchers. That way you will perform much better, because after few calls you will know what words to use for best results.

2. When you convince few, for example hairdressers, you should always mention to new potential client that his competition is already using this. It will have double positive effect for you: firstly, the fact someone like you is already using this, will serve as social proof to your service. Secondly, nobody wants to stay behind his close competitors.

Offer to charge appropriate sum to those who would be potentialy interested (who you convince about benefits of your service) but are not good enough with computers (or to busy/lazy) and send someone overthere to sort out the registration for them.

You make sales calls to as many local businesses as possible. You tell them why they should sign up (what do they get out of it?). If they won't take the time, then ask them to let **you** fill out their entry.
