I just incorporated a Delaware C Corp a few months ago and have no significant activity yet.

I have 2 Advisors that I need to issue options to, and my question is how do I set the option exercise price? I've found a very good white paper here: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww-bcf.usc.edu%2F~kjmurphy%2FHallMurf6.pdf&ei=IHCFTPLUOIK6sAOC0Mn2Bw&usg=AFQjCNG8YQwUJdPP4QIbQ8FBsjDQW9DFRw&sig2=_jE-0g8snG0vhkjrFsw08A

The paper suggests to set the option exercise price at-the-money, i.e. at the price of the share on the grant date.

Based on your different experiences, do you have any comments on suggestions on this? I'd like a perspective on tax issues too if possible.

Thanks!

<p>Typically, your option price is 8-15 x LESS than your common share price but that's all pure rule of thumb.</p>

<p>A great article that details how to set Employee Stock Options is <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/features/eso/eso2.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It goes a pretty good job of explaining how the government wants you to calculate it.</p>

<p>Traditionally, options have been set at 1/10 the round price since the math was easy and no one really paid attention to options. Nowadays, the option price is looked at since it's supposed to be adjusted when the risk of the venture is reduced. So, the closer you are to a product or exit, the closer the option price should be to the stock price (within reason).</p>

In your scenario, yes, the option price should probably be set to the price per share at the grant date. In other words, your company today is worth the same as it did a few months ago when you incorporated it since, as you mention, not much has happened since. 

Here's a lawyer's discussion of this:

> What are the acceptable methods for determining fair market value of private company stock?

> The fair market value of private company stock must be determined, based on the private company’s own facts and circumstances, by the application of a reasonable valuation method. A method will not be considered reasonable if it does not take into consideration all available information material to the valuation of the private company.

    > * the present value of future cash-flows;

    > * other relevant factors such as control premiums or discounts for lack of marketability.

You should probably talk to a cpa/accountant/attorney about this as it has significant tax and other implications.

Setting the price "At the money" sounds reasonable.

All the answers above are very good and the articles are accurate. One good start as a guide would be to find out if there are any publically traded companies that do something similar to your start up and see from the volatility of their share price over the life of your company up until you issue the options (assuming your start up has any revenues and you can compare EBITDA etc to these companies). 

This is just a start and by no means the only information you will use to properly value the options, much more though needs to go into it, but once you value the options then you set the exercise price at that price or above that price, but don’t set it below it that is where you can run into tax implications.

Not to get too technical, but if the advisors are not employees or directors of the company one could argue that they be characterized as warrants and not options, which are basically the same thing with different accounting consequences under FAS 123R.

Hope this helps
