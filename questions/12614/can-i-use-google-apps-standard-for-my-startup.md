I want to use Google apps for my bootstraped startup (currently, just me, myself and I). The Google Apps Standard Edition intro talks about individulas and groups, but does not mention anything about (small) companies.

Am I breaking the terms if use it for my email?

<p>To the best of my knowledge, no problem. I know of several small companies which use Google Apps Standard for all their email &amp; calendar needs. After a quick glance through <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/terms/standard_terms.html" rel="nofollow">their terms of service</a> I didn't find any limitations on the type of organization to use Google Apps.</p>

<p>If you want to know for sure, you could email Google and ask.</p>

Yes!  I have used it on several startups and it is, by far, the best free app you can use.

Google Apps is the perfect point where you can start up your business and give it an electronic framework. There is no such thing known or issue that you mentioned. So go ahead using it.

I believe google apps free edition supports upto 10 users. So as long as you have under 10 users it a great tool.
