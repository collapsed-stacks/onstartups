The project I'm working on requires hardware and software, and especially a very solid business plan.

I have no real experience in project management (only engineering school project management), nor in business.

At a Startup Weekend, a team formed around my idea: one great business / finance person, one great project manager who kept us focused, one engineer who wants to be in business and an IT engineer.

I need mostly engineers to make this happen. Several people (including my boss at work) have shown a lot of interest and _want to help_.

For the moment, we have no funding whatsoever and my pockets aren't too deep. In addition, I would like to double check that this thing can actually work before registering for a company and starting to officially hire people.

My questions are the following:

 - Is team of eight too big for a startup? How to keep everyone motivated and hard working if we're so many?
 - We have absolutely no funding yet and I cannot pay anybody: is everybody to work for free? If not, how to evaluate or measure everyone's actual effort?

You don't have a "startup" here; you have a "project." Until you incorporate, have customers, etc., you're just working on a project with friends.

Eight founders is too many; two founders and six other people working for those two people is not. Once you've established the one or two people who are setting the direction of the project/company, you can do whatever you want.
