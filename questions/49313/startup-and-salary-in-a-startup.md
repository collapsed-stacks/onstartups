I have been approached by a startup company in France (sorry for my English!) which says it wants me.

I'm currently working in the finance industry and being paid around 50K Euros a year, plus several other advantages including approx. 2K for buying food at noon, and a 'bonus' depending of the growth of the company (approx. 2 to 3K). So Total is around 54K.

The startup can offer me 48k, without any compensation.

I think the project might be challenging, with a better team, and the financial state of the company looks OK to me. 

However, the major downside is a serious loss of money for me.

I've spoke with the CTO which says he cannot 'spend' more this year for me but expects to see more cash flow next year.

Any Ideas how I could try to negociate a little more on my salary ? 

I thought about things but i'm not sure if it's a good idea:

- asking for stock options
- asking for a 'bonus' of 2K
- trying to negotiate an increase of salary within a year
- asking for a 2K compensation for food, which might be 'cheaper' for them because of lower taxes for this kind of budget

Thank you in advance for your advices and comments ;)

cheers

Well first of all budget your 48K. Can you still live comfortably with your current expenses?
Assuming you can live comfortably, then the good things about joining a startup is you get a shot at a great role that can help catapult your career.

Discuss with the CTO, how does he see you as a strategic fit in the organization? Let him know your aspirations as well. 

How do you see yourself 6 months from now. Managing a team? You can bargain with him for training courses which can add value to yourself and to the organization.

In a startup you get quickly to where you want to get with least resistance and you get to experience many facets of the organization. Invaluable experience that is.

And ask what are the expansion plans of the startup. When the startup expands, you get great roles at the new place.

If the startup is within the first 2 years, then you can ask for atleast 2.5% of the stake, based on a vested period. See joel spoelsky article: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6949/forming-a-new-software-startup-how-do-i-allocate-ownership-fairly. So check which layer you come in.

Good luck!
