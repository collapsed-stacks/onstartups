As EU companies are aware, the personal data protection law doesn't allow EU companies to store data in servers located outside of the EU. The only way to do this is for the provider to join the Safe Harbor Program.

I couldn't find any CRM such as BantamLive, BatchBook who actually joined this program. This goes for many other US based SaaS such as mailchimp.

The question is: What are other EU companies doing, just breaking the law?

<p>The UK Information Commissioner's Office has <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/principle_8.aspx" rel="nofollow">information and guidance on this issue</a> that is based on what the EU thinks on various issues (rather than just being the UK implementation). Basically any Canadian server is fine as Canada is considered by the EU to have adequate laws. US companies can be signed up to the Safe Harbour scheme and there are some that are not, but it is not the case that if they are not signed up you cannot use those companies - the site includes links with further information on companies that cannot be part of the scheme.</p>

<p>It also states that you should be making it clear that the data is leaving the EEA (European Economic Area) somewhere on the site, frankly this is good practice anyway.</p>

<p>On the Safe Harbour scheme - it is not a requirement for the company to be a part - just that the scheme is considered sufficient to meet the nescessary criteria for data safety. You can assess the adequacy of another companies scheme yourself or go through a third party to get the assessment. What this does mean however if there is a complaint against you your use of the non Safe Harbour company your assessment will be examined and you may be found to be in breach and therefore liable for penalties.</p>

<p>So the SaaS services you mention will likely have assessments that have been carried out on them by a company in the EU that you are able to access. You will almost certainly have to pay - but it will cost you less than contracting your own data protection assessment, it will probably also come with a level of indemnity.</p>

<p>I don't think your basic assertion is correct.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>, the relevant Directive's "eight enforceable principles of good practice" are that personal data must be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fairly and lawfully processed.</li>
<li>Processed for limited purposes.</li>
<li>Adequate, relevant and not excessive.</li>
<li>Accurate.</li>
<li>Kept no longer than necessary.</li>
<li>Processed in accordance with the data subject's rights.</li>
<li>Secure.</li>
<li>Transferred only to countries with adequate protection.</li>
</ol>

<p>EU Directives as don't have legal force. Member states are expected to ensure that local legislation will achieve the desired result by a given date. It's not unusual for the precise legislation to vary widely. (EU <em>Regulations</em>, on the other hand, are immediately enforceable throughout the EU without local legislation.)</p>

<p>So it isn't true to say, "the personal data protection law doesn't allow EU companies to store data in servers located outside of the EU." (a) Such law varies in important ways from country to country within the EU;  (b) the EU Directive requires only that such data should be "Transferred only to countries with adequate protection."</p>

<p>Good practice in the EU is therefore principally a matter of compliance auditing - for instance, an EU company should make reasonable efforts to ensure that services used to hold such data avoid jurisdictions without adequate protection. And similarly, any cloud service or hosting operation expecting to do business in the EU would do well to ensure it is able to provide explicit assurance that data is only held in countries with adequate protection.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles" rel="nofollow">EU-US "Safe Harbor"</a> is an opt-in scheme to enable US companies to offer assurance that their services will be compliant. It <em>isn't</em> mandatory. So it's also an error to suggest that "the only way to [comply with EU data protection] is for the provider to join the Safe Harbor Program." It's simply one way for a provider to demonstrate compliance.</p>
