## As a single founder, is it worth the effort to add a new (novice) co-founder?

I have often read that single founder companies are given lower priority by incubators and angels. I was thinking about bringing in an additional founder. 

They will be "new." <s>First, I will have to tell him everything that I know before we can move forward.</s> Well, some correction. I think i can manage most of the work myself. He will be there for the investors who would otherwise be reluctant to invest in a single person company. he can then gradually learn and i wont have to dedicate time and effort for that.

From 'everything' I mean not just software or entrepreneurship;  I will probably have to tell him/her the very basics of my current business and software. He/she probably won't even know what a 'startup' really is.

So is it worth that effort?

**From how you've described it, no way**.  The investors will quiz you on your roles and they'll quickly realise that the contribution from the other 'founder' is small and challenge you on why you set up the company in this way.  They aren't going to invest just because Founders=2.

If you bring on another founder, it has to be with building a better company in mind, not for pleasing investors.  If the person you bring in has years of experience with successful startups and it is clear that they would have (for instance) a mentoring/coaching role then that's completely different.  They would be bringing something to the table, and the investors would be reassured by that.  On the other hand add a founder that doesn't contribute and you'll make the investors very confused as to why you've done this, and their confidence in you will evaporate.

Only bring people in because they will enhance your business and add value - investors understand this.  Bring people in to make the headcount look more credible isn't a strategy.

My gut says it's not worth it. You have way too many things to do to have to teach a novice about how to do a startup. 

You do need more people at your company but I would stick with seasoned veterans. Once you have a solid team, then you might consider a newbie for doing development.

Your efforts would be better spent building a compelling product and gaining paying customers, as ultimately that will help with investors more than a body count.

This seems like a really bad idea from a company structure point of view.  If he's really a co-founder, won't he then also have some controlling share of the company, and expect a fair amount of the profits, etc?  This sounds like putting an anchor around your neck and then trying to build a company with the additional weight to pull.
