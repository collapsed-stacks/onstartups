I would like an accountancy firm to deal with *almost everything* financial for my business - sorting out of tax returns, optimization of taxation. Even management of payroll.

Do accountants typically offer such a service and what is it called?

Accountants do offer services like what you mention. It's typically called outsourced accounting. What you describe does cut across several different functional accounting disciplines but it's most inline with a company controller or the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)

The company controller literally controls the money while the CFO controllers everything under accounting. Maybe that's what you need -- an outsourced CFO.

<p>I think many firms do this.  I got a pitch from a company called <a href="http://www.corefino.com/" rel="nofollow">Corefino</a> about a year ago that seemed to be targeting what you are looking for.</p>
