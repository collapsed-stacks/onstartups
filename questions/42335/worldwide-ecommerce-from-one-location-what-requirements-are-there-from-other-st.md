Details: I plan to sell downloadable information through passive search-engine ads, which could end up anywhere. I am hoping that US copyrights will be sufficient (can I do better?).

My unbacked assumptions include:

 - Exemption from needing to collect taxes from buyers outside my state (e.g., sales tax nexus, state income tax returns, etc.).
 - Exemption from needing permission from other states and countries (e.g., foreign LLC registrations, fees, etc.).
 - Exemption from needing to add locale-specific things to the terms of agreement, or to the transaction (e.g., translations, specific clauses, currency options, etc.).

If possible, provide sources. I have not seen anything official. “No news” is not always “good news” because simplicity and ignorance do not always prevent punishment.

Is ecommerce essentially as easy as just getting a city business license, home-state filings, and a federal EIN —- regardless of what customs & laws other states and countries have?

<p>some basic questions</p>

<ol>
<li><p>are you the copyright owner or do you have permission to on-sell the digital downloads in question. The penalties for commercial infringement can be criminal under some jurisdictions</p></li>
<li><p>copyright is international and defaults at point of creation but it helps to register it in some countries eg China where it is a prerequisite for collecting damages from others who attempt to infringe. Who are you attempting to protect your copyright against and what effort-reward is justified?</p></li>
<li><p>eCommerce is governed by Vienna <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_Contracts_for_the_International_Sale_of_Goods" rel="nofollow">Sales of Goods</a> but you may be caught by various Fair Trading acts (fit for purposes or false advertising) in the purchaser's jurisdiction. So have you thought about a refund policy or credit card reversal?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>International taxes/duties are a royal pain. Technically the importer/purchaser is responsible for paying any additional taxes but practically it is near impossible to enforce.  Basically a sale is a contract so you need to make sure that the obligations are clearly spelled out including definition of what you are selling (technically a grant of license to copyrighted material).</p>
