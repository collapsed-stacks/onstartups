I am setting up an application where an user has the capability to send and receive money (somewhat similar to paypal).

I have been researching online for the last few weeks and have only come across paypal which has website payment pro API which allows me to do this from my website.

Any other ideas? Their monthly fees is inhibiting and I was looking for a per-transaction fee model.


Cheers

You're looking for an [ACH Merchant Account](http://www.paysimple.com/ach_merchant_account.html), the company I linked to offers them for a 55 cents flat fee. If you're doing something "similar to paypal" there may be a lot of regulations and licensing involved. PayPal has licensing in every jurisdiction that they have a user in, which amounts to hundreds or thousands of licenses and millions of dollars in expenses.
