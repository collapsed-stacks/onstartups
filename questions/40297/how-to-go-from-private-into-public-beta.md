I'm currently having an app in private beta and I'm now ready to launch it. 
Should I just make it available on my website or should I seek out for a blog that announces the launch to get some media coverage?

To answer your question which if I am understanding it correctly is getting the word out in a controlled manner so everyone is not coming to download/purchase your app but having people that have a real interest in your app and can provide some real feedback.

In that case I would offer the following path (I am not sure of your resources so I am assume its just you).

1. Make sure the app downloads and installs/uninstalls correctly. I have been places where they assume just because it works on their test machine it will work anywhere.

2. Announce the launch on your own website

3. Create a video/slideshow showing how to install it, major features and some private beta reviews and feedback. Be sure to link it on your own website

4. Contact blogs and websites that your target market reads or has a interest in to ask them to review the product and to talk about it (might have to offer some incentives)

5. Announce it on some form of social media and point to the reviews and your own website.
