<p>"Platform as a Service" (PaaS) is a subset of "Software as a Service" (SaaS). The main difference is that the software in PaaS is intended for other software developers / companies, not end users / private persons.</p>

<p>It mainly differs by platform stability being more desirable in PaaS; i.e. high uptime is expected, and API's should be more stable and backwards compatible and not introduce breaking changes without good reason.</p>
