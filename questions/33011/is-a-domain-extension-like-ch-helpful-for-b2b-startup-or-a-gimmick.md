My planned company name ends with "ch", - let's say it's "Velocity Reasearch".  velocityreseach.com and velocityresear.ch are both available.  Is using a TLD like .ch in this way considered a gimmick or entirely appropriate to a serious B2B software company?

**EDIT:** To frame the question better: assume I own both the .com and .ch.  Which should I promote as primary URL and use in email addresses, etc?  The .ch is three letters less typing.

Personally, I would register both. Most internet users default to a .com when attempting to reach a website. However, using a .ch can be a nice gimmick that will help you stand out. I'd register both and have the .com redirect to the .ch. Just my opinion though.

Repeat visits will often be either bookmarks or just simple searches in Google for "Velocity Research".

No one will bother remembering your exact domain, but you.

Not buying the .com but just going for the .ch is definitely a very big mistake. Buying both and promoting the .com makes the .ch useless (which it is).

PS. '.ch' is often not faster to type - enter domain + Alt+Enter adds the '.com'. Also a lot of mobile devices with virtual keyboards have a '.com' button.

I would use the .com. For SEO and credibility, it's much better. Vanity URLs are appropriate for very short URLs only or stuff like go.to/google
