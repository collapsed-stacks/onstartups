I have a small sole proprietorship in the U.S.  When I do my taxes at the end of the year I deduct my business expenses from my sales to figure about my taxable income.  For example, I deduct my web hosting costs.

If I donate money to an open source software project that is not a 501(c)(3) (or anything else like that), can I deduct this as a business expense?

No, you cannot. You can only deduct charitable contributions if they're to an organization recognized by the IRS, and that goes on schedule A. You can deduct business expenses if they're ordinary and necessary, and that goes on schedule C. Your donation is neither charitable nor necessary, thus non-deductible.
