If I create an application for a client and I am employed as a contactor to the client by a contracting firm in a different capacity, who owns the copyright?

Relying on legal adivce here probably is not the best idea.  You need to consult an attorney.  

In addition to asking whether:

 - You made the software on company/client time;
 - You used company/client tools or equipment; and
 - The software is something related to your employment;

you will also be asked:

 - Whether you used any confidential information to develop or test the software.

This is not the typical IP employer ownership situatiuon because the software is already being used (on what basis? license?), and there are up to *four* potential claimants involved.  Your employment contact--supposing it is enforceable as to the software--likely does not provide a clear answer here.  On the other hand, your employer's contract with the client may contain an important provision.  If this is valuable, you need to get effective representation and quickly.

You need to start by reviewing your employment agreement/contract and state law for both where  you work and where the company is headquartered.  And then check with a lawyer.

IANAL, but my first guess would be that ABC company owns the copyright.  While it may not be in your job description to write software, you wrote it while employed by them and it appears that you are using it as part of your job for them.  In effect, you took it upon yourself to make your job easier (and the job of your company) while in their employ.  It all goes back to  them.  

If the airport is using it not in context of the work your company does, it could be even stickier.  Your connection to the airport is because of your company, so that could create implied consent that you may have overstepped.

This could be a sticky issue, state and federal law is not always clear or in agreement.  If you have real concerns about trying to maintain ownership, you need to talk to your management and a lawyer.
