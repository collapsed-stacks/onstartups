I hold many trademarks personally (no business entity involves here).

If I launch a company which is independent legal entity, do I need to give trademark rights to company before using it? Or, I was thinking this: My own company can survive without such rights because I would never sue my own company. And, I can sue other companies which would use trademark without taking its right from me. Am I missing something?

Yes, you are missing something.

In the U.S. (other countries are likely similar), you can't get a trademark unless you are actually using the trademark in commerce.  You as an individual can't get a trademark if you are not using the mark.

I suppose you could use the trademark as an individual and also have the company use the same mark, but that seems likely to create a host of problems.  People would have trouble distinguishing the two of you and maybe (speculating) that might lead to piercing the corporate veil.

If you got a trademark and are not using it, then you may not have read the fine print of the trademark application.  That could be a problem as it would be a false statement to the trademark office.

If you got a trademark and are using it, then transferring the mark from yourself to the company, might be a taxable event as the mark would have some value.  Maybe someone else here can elaborate on that.
