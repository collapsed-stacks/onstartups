When the Operating Agreement is housed in the executive offices vs. the attorney of the members?

From your question, I assume that the Operating Agreement is not otherwise publicly available (eg. required to be filed with the state).

The only scenario I can think of where you would be forced to disclose this document would be part of a lawsuit.  If someone sues the LLC, they could ask for this document in discovery.

Note that storing the document with your attorney does not help protect the information.  You can't hide documents that are otherwise not protected (such as this one) by giving them to your attorney.  So you might as well store it with your other business records (assuming they are secure).
