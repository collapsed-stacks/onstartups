## Do I have a really low conversion rate?

My startup sells designer furniture exclusively via an internet shop, we are have been around for about a year now and sell in 5 different countries. We do manage to get plenty of visitors but the conversion rate of these visits is about 0.20%. This makes it really tough to get the data to start making decisions on good keywords (we use google adwords). This conversion rate seems pretty consistant across countries/languages and with different people managing the different countries.

we do get a number of sales and are able to operate profitably but these conversion rates are crazily low according to the many blogs i have trawled.

My question is whether this conversion rate is normal for the online furniture industry or whether there is something going wrong here.

Regards,

Dennis

<p><a href="http://gesterling.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/why-are-e-commerce-conversion-rates-so-low/" rel="nofollow">This blog post</a>, citing a Forrester/eMarketer report, points to an 2-3% average conversion rate in online retail. Googling some <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=expected+conversion+rates+for+online+retail" rel="nofollow">I find 2-3% to be common</a>. </p>

<p>However, I'm sure that it varies greatly between different industries (som Industries reportedly have as high as 30% conversion rates). I couldn't find good data on furniture. Perhaps someone else is more lucky.</p>

Give us a link to your website. Your conversion rate sounds low even for high end products. Perhaps the OnStartups community will have some suggestions for you.
