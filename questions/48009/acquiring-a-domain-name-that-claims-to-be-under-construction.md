I am planning to launch a new SaaS product that nicely fits a catchy word. it would make a perfect brand name, but the domain name is already taken. the site claims to be under construction for at least a few months, and offers no way of reaching that company's services. 

I also suspect that they dont even have a product yet for that site, so it wont be that painful to give that domain name away. 

I know everything is for sale for the right price, but **how should i approach negotiating for it. and what price should i expect**

>godaddy offers to contact the owner and negotiate for me.;
>http://www.valuate.com/ which calculates domain name prices, it approximates it to be around 30000 usd but i assume this prices to be highly flexible accordig to the owners expectation.

<p>Your comment likely answered your question - prices (and valuations) are all over the place, and what is acceptable is based on the sellers perceived value and your ability to meet that.  Basic rules apply - shorter words are preferred, .com is worth more than others, hyphenated phrases (buy-now.com vs buynow.com) are less desirable. </p>

<p><strong>Some other pointers:</strong>
If the owner has 100's of other domains, they likely are reselling the domain. check the owners name / company in google before contact.  </p>

<p>If the owner has renewed the domain over many years / or just registered it, they likely are not interested in selling it. </p>

<p>Many times GoDaddy type services are simply trying to push services - unless the domain specifically states it is interested in selling the owner likely isn't looking to sell. Example: I did a search on godaddy for one of my domains that I have no interest in selling, and there it was, a "want to buy this domain?" offer.  </p>

<p><strong>How to approach:</strong>
First thing would be to find the administrative contact for the domain. 
Go to a whois site like <a href="http://whois.sc" rel="nofollow">whois.sc</a> (or whatever you desire) and enter in the domain in question.  check the administrative contact email - some times it will be a real email address, other times a privacy connect. Try sending an email to that address expressing interest.  Sometimes that works, other times the email gets lost in the spam filters.</p>

<p>Second would be to find the address of the owner.  Do some sleuthing around via the net to see if you can find a phone number associated with the address. Again, if privacy filters are in place, you may not have a path here.</p>

<p>Third would be to check the current webpage (if its not a coming soon page) and see if there are some indicators on where the owner is located. </p>

<p>Bar that, you can only go through the "negotiation" path that services like godaddy provides.  </p>
