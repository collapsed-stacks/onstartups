Is there a comprehensive business database out there that takes variables for sorting?

For example, if I wanted to say something like, "Show me all businesses with more than 50 employees within a 100 mile radius of zip code 55555."  Anyone know of anything like this?

InfoUSA is a great source for this type of information.  Beyond zip codes and area, you could filter buy number of employees, years in business and even the type of Business based upon SIC codes.  This is useful if you have built an application that targets a certain demographic, or client type.

For example, lets say you built SALON software.  You could use infousa to get a list of hair salons that have 4+ employees in the states where you want to target.  Very smart marketing when combined with Email, Direct Mail, Phone and even in person sales visits. 

Best of luck.

Yes there are packages with that type of information in it.  They vary for the different map demographic software packages.  Pricing is typcially in the thousands.

There are several packages out there.  To get started search for terms like: "Demographic business map packages marketing"

The closest type of free information that is available from the US government comes from the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and its Occupation Employment Bureau: 

http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp/index.html

http://www.bls.gov/oes/

Unfortunately, they do not disclose names of individual businesses but they do provide data on number of employees per average establishment per zip code in any particular NAICS sector.

There may be private sources that are closer to what you want (they typically amass info. from phone books and cold calling) but they will be pricey and there's no guarantee they'll be accurate (how would you check them?).
