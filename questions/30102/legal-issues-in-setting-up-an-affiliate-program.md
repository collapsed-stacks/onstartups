Are there any legal issues with setting up an affiliate program?  Basically a system where people can get rewarded for referrals.

Even if there's nothing major, are there any words you should make sure to avoid like "intern", etc.?

Just trying to get a general idea of the issues out there.  I know that ultimately I should get a lawyer to writeup the terms, but just want to get a general picture to begin with.

In a non-regulated industry (like securities or real estate for example) most of your legal issues will be around how the associated affiliate disclose their relationship to you. 

In many jurisdictions -- including in the United States -- individuals providing testimonial support in exchange for compensation must disclose this relationship. 

Disclosure will be your friend -- make sure that your affiliate properly present their relationship to you to the individual they "refer" to you -- and you will be in much better standing for anything which comes your way. 

If you are in a regulated industry -- for example if your price-comparison website is comparing a product which the person that does the actually selling needs to be licensed -- then there are much stricter rules. Sometimes the word affiliate or referral will need to be avoided. Sometimes you can pay a marketing fee-- and other times you can not.

Aside from Joseph's answer- be aware that if you are selling taxable items **many** states have passed laws that make you responsible for collecting sales tax **if** you have an affiliate in their state. Without affiliates, you are only responsible for collecting sales tax in **your** state. With affilates, you have to collect sales tax in all states that you have an affilate in *(provided that state has one of these special laws)*.
