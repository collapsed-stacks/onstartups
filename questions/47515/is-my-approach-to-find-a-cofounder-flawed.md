## Is my approach to find a cofounder flawed?

I've gone to countless networking events, underground entrepreneur groups, cofounder sites like CoFoundersLab, etc. I'm looking more on the business-dev. end.

I've talked to quite a few 1:1 and met quite a few times - they just either:

1) Havent been the right fit as a cofounder ( and I've had (2) past failures due to rushing into business rel).

2) Are working on their own business and don't want to entertain any other idea.

What could I potentially be doing wrong? Am I looking in the wrong spots?

Does it just make sense to just keep developing myself and bag a cofounder until later?

What is the absolutely number one thing you need this person to bring to the table?

Contacts? Domain expertise? Money?

Figure out which of these things you need and then figure out where the people with *those* skills go. Local chambers of commerce, professional associations, etc are all probably good starting places.

*And you may not even **need** a co-founder yet..*

I'm playing with an idea now in the [domain I don't know] space. The first thing I did was reach out through my contacts to see who I did know. I was lucky enough to find someone with a background in the space.. who then pointed me towards the industry leaders, some info/training sessions, and has started making intros.

I've got to agree with @Salmon. People show up to those networking events with their own idea in mind to find a co-founder. The approach I've had with my co-founder is I help with her start-up, and after it's a success we work on mine. Tough negotiation and you have to give a lot of trust to your parter but's it's worked on several projects. 

Expand your network beyond these types of people, look at your LinkedIn and connect with people that aren't necessarily looking to start their own project, but would love to work on your product. Convince them that it will be a fun project too, no one wants to work long nights for someone after they've already put in an 8 hour day somewhere else. 

Also consider that your project may not be that sound. Great ideas are plenty, but lucrative opportunities that are in a defensible market aren't. Analyse the value of your product, the revenue potential, and objectively how you come off. Are you providing enough of a skill-set that they would find it a valuable opportunity? Do you come off defensive about your idea? Or are you fun, love life, and genuinely want to provide assistance. You get a lot more when you decide you're going to give unconditionally. 

Feel free to connect on LinkedIn.

I think the problem with all these meetups is that **everyone** comes there with their own idea in mind. So you pitch them your idea - they pitch you theirs back. 

Try to look for people who:

 1. you know you will be comfortable working with
 2. currently have a full time position at a small company or at least have some previous start-up experience
 3. always wanted to start a company but never had a [courage,money,time,motivation] to do that. 

After that you will have to convince them to join you. This process is extremely difficult and **will** take a lot of time, but that's the only good way I know.
