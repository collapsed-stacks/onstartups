## Have you had actual legal issues in a startup?

In getting started we all take shortcuts.  I'm thinking about when we:

 - hire employees without having employee manuals or making them agree that they are at-will employees
 - enter into an agreement with a partner with a contract that does not have all the legal-eze in it
 - make a deal without getting full legal advice

In big companies it's expected that all of this is done 100% correctly but in startups we have to make a tradeoff about how much energy to devote to this.  My questions is have you ever regretted it?  Have you ever gotten into a situation where you though "I really wished I'd gotten more legal advice before going into this" or is it just as easy to fix most things after the fact.

<p>I am puzzled why you would want to hire employees <strong>without</strong> an at-will employment acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Hiring employees without an ironclad assignment of all rights to whatever they create is one of the most serious, and most common, mistakes that I see startup companies make - please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/07/21/securing-ip-requires-more-than-an-nda/">Securing IP Requires More than an NDA</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding the potential perils of fixing problems after the fact, each situation is unique, so it is impossible to generalize.

Most companies in the "start-up" phase don't tend to have legal problems.  It's when they mature into larger companies, take on later-stage investors, dissolve or are sold, and/or come under the scrutiny of regulators and government agencies that they face legal issues either on existing issues or past conduct that wasn't handled properly.

Partnership, equity, and employment issues immediately spring to mind. Handling these issues from the get go can save you a headache and legal fees further down the road.

OK, this was asked a long time ago, but I'm first seeing it now. For those who may find this in later searches:

**Yes, I have *personally* had severe legal issues in a young startup.**

I really can't elaborate in a public forum, but I certainly advise others to not cut corners on the legal stuff.

**Another thing:** I'm pretty sure this discussion suffers from survivorship bias. In other words, the startup community doesn't hear much from those startups who **do** have legal problems, because those startups often 'die' and leave the community. IMHO this leads to many people under-estimating how common this class of problems is.
