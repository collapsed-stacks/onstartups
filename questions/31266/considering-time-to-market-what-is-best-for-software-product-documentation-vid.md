I'm in the process of publishing my product which is ready for beta testing. It has some level of complexity, therefore guidance is required. But I don't want to spend (yet) a couple of months writing detailed documentation.

So, to start with and based on your experiences, what option would be the best?

- Basic written documentation/manuals (with screenshots, callouts, etc.)
- Introductory videos for overview and the main features

NOTE: This is to learn the usage of my product, not for marketing promotion.

<p>I'm not sure what level of technical sophistication you were expecting, but guiders.js is a great open-source package that makes it easy to build step-by-step walk-throughs and tutorials into any web application. </p>

<p>It is fairly easy to setup -- but the main benefit is that it allows you to add documentation <em>directly inside</em> your application, rather than showing screenshots inside separate media like videos or PDFs. This makes it very intuitive and user friendly. </p>
