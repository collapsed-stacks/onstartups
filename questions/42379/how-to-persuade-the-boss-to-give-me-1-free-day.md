I am working in a small software company. Owner directly manages the business.
I'd like to start my own project, part time.

I have a family. It is difficult to find free time to work on my project.
I am going to ask my boss to give me one free day a week, keeping the same salary.

Is it a good idea? If it is, how to start the conversation? What should I say and what should I not say?

I think he appreciates my work and does not want me to leave the company.
He pays me a good salary but I feel I could get more elsewhere.
I think at the moment having extra time to work on the project is more important than the salary increase. 

Many thanks

EDIT 1

Is it a good idea to promise him a percentage of the profit (10%? 20%) - while I run the project and still work for him? I mean profit sharing, not the ownership.

Wearing my boss hat what you seem to be doing is:

 1. Asking for a 20% raise
 2. Asking me to go to the time and expense
    of finding somebody to cover the extra day that you won't be
    working.
 3. Signalling that you're likely not going to be here in
    the long term.

I'm not seeing the upside here :-)

Unless you are currently *extremely* underpaid for the role (1) is going to raise questions. Since the time taken to do (2) is pretty close to the time it would take me to find a new full time employee I'm going to be saying "hmmmm" to myself. 

Note: It doesn't matter if you are underpaid for your personal skills - only if you're underpaid for the role you're currently filling. The former means you're in the wrong position - not that you're underpaid.

I'd also be thinking that this person is starting his own business. If that's a success then he/she is not going to stay. I'd also be thinking that this person is obviously not satisfied and challenged in his current role, otherwise they wouldn't be off to start their own side project. 

So - if I were you - I'd be thinking of ways to address these sorts of questions. They key to successful negotiations is having both sides walk away feeling like they've won. 

I'd also be thinking about what your BATNA will be (I'm guessing looking for another job with higher pay?)

Offer him 20% of the business you are starting and he might go for it.

Point out any cross-over work that might exist where stuff you learn from your own project will benefit your work for him and/or his business.

Add that Google give their employees 1 day a week to work on their own projects with a similar scheme.

While you're at it, you could also ask him if he'd be interested in investing in the idea too!

Good luck,
Dave

Say nothing to your boss, stay at the job and go for a raise.

That done, use the extra money to get a programmer to get on-board to help you. You can work a few hours on the weekend and you can also hire some talent from a second-world country (no offense intended) to take advantage of the salary differences.

You keep full equity and your boss is unaware and happy. +1 for Adrian Howard 's boss hat!
