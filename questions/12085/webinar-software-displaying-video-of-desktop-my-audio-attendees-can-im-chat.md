Looking to do some interactive webinars.<br>

These are the features I feel it needs to do:<br>

1.) Share my desktop so the people watching can see what I'm doing. They don't need to be able to take control of my desktop, just viewing is fine.<br>
2.) Hear my voice as I'm demoing software on my desktop. <br>
3.) All participants in the webinar can can ask questions in an instant message window <br>

If you've heard of a service that offers this mix of features, I would love to know about it.

<p>and welcome to this site! :-)</p>

<p>Don't more or less all providers meet those criteria? Maybe you should look at other criteria too, such as price.</p>

<p>AFAIK <a href="http://www.WebEx.com" rel="nofollow">WebEx</a>, <a href="http://www.gotomeeting.com/" rel="nofollow">Go To Meeting</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatconnectpro/" rel="nofollow">Adobe's Connect</a> and many more can do that.</p>

<p>I personally like Adobe's Connect Pro a lot. Adobe also has something (less expensive) under their Acrobat.com portal, maybe this offering can be attractive.</p>

<p>Another option: <a href="http://www.calliflower.com/" rel="nofollow">Calliflower</a>.  Nice featureset specifically for webinars (delegate access, voting, etc.) and shared application (powerpoint, etc). Priced more competitively than other services (webex, gotomeeting, etc.)  </p>

<p>Also - <a href="http://www.beaconlive.com/" rel="nofollow">BeaconLive</a>.  Client I have swears by it for webinars.  They have a pay per event ecom offering &amp; SOAP integration capability as well. </p>

<p>You may also want to check out <a href="http://www.supercoolschool.com/" rel="nofollow">Super Cool School</a>. They use the Adobe Connect program, but it is free. You can hold public or private classes.</p>

<p>Since DimDim is no more! Try <a href="http://banckle.com/apps/online-meeting/default.html" rel="nofollow">Banckle Online Meeting</a> that is a perfect alternative of DimDim and a feature-rich solution for web conferences and webinars.</p>
