I am trying to collect numbers, to show how many people like my idea. I am thinking of making the website viral. I want to make it so, that when one person likes/share the site, other people see it (their friends) and they check out the site.. hopefully, when they visit, they will click the share/like button... and then it'll start..

I am already getting some Twitter shares, but I need to get Facebook rolling, as its where all of my audience is. 

So guys, whats better to get the wheel rolling and collecting numbers? Facebook like or Facebook share?

<p>Bhargav, not sure if you saw these, but these similar questions were asked previously that might be helpful:</p>

<p>I prefer the Share button over the new Like button because I think the way the Share button displays the information on someone's Facebook news feed makes it more clickable. The advantage of the Like button over the Share button is that the Like button is a lot quicker to use for the reader, so it has the potential of being used more often than the Share button. </p>

<p>But as Ethan pointed out, you can try them both to see which one works best for you. I've even seen sites using both the Like and Share buttons at the same time.</p>

FB Share will give you more visibility in the Facebook News Feed because it will pull the page link, a thumbnail photo, and a meta description from the website/link shared.  FB Like will simply give you one small line in a news feed that says "Bharav liked PoiintsVault on PoiintsVault.com.

Also, I wouldn't be so adamant about your audience being on Facebook if Twitter is providing you with the most amount of traction - at this point the data is pointing to the contrary, although the data could be misleading assuming the same person clicked the twitter button 10 times...

In any case, while FB Share will provide better visibility in the News Feed, don't be afraid to test and experiment with other options such as a Like button or even a Like box.
