i am from india developing a startup. 
being in india the tax laws are pretty old and confusing and i need help regarding it.
this is my question:
think of my business like an app store.
people can sell applications and digital files like images , themes (no music or videos). The sellers as well as buyers are all across the world and my store will do business on a commision basis. What kind of taxes am i looking at.Most importantly sales tax / vat.
as i am the only owner so the startup will be registered as a proprietary concern.Any types of links ,impormation personal experience would help. Thank You.
