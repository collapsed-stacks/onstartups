I've been getting conflicting advice about this, and figure if there's a spot that would know the answer one way or the other, it's onstartups.com

In a nutshell I'm trying to find out if I have to register in every province that I wish to acquire business in. For example, if I'm registered in PEI, but wanted to acquire some contracts from customers or companies in Nova Scotia, would I have to register in both provinces to legally acquire business in either jurisdiction? If so, would it be easier to just register as a federal incorporation and be done with it?

<p>Short answer: no, no you don't have to register elsewhere.</p>

<p>Feel free to get your customers anywhere.</p>

<p>You will, however, need to think about which taxes you will have to collect on from customers in other provinces. There is a tonne of information available on it, but you might want to connect with your local enterprise centre. Here is a good read: <a href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/pst/a/PSTecommerce.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/pst/a/PSTecommerce.htm</a></p>

<p>Also, trying giving XEDC a call - I realize it's NS, not PEI, but they're just across the straight and have a good team there. <a href="http://xedc.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://xedc.ca/</a></p>
