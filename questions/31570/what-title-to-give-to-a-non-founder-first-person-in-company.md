This question is a follow up to [another][1] question but it stands as a question by itself so i decided to ask it separately..

i am a single-founder starting a company and hence looking for investments/incubator/YC.
clearly i can't go through it alone, i need some one. So i asked the above linked question as to should i add a novice founder (that is all i can find right now being where i am) because investors tend to avoid single founder companies and i might need a hand at small day to day stuff. The response was that i shouldn't and i agree with it. Make no mistake, he is just novice in tech startup industry but is a brilliant person, i just believe in a fast paced tech startup industry, it just won't be worth it to teach him enough so that he can be a founder. Currently, as it stands, he does not bring anything to the table.

But i need someone, that's a given, so i decided to hire him a a sort of employee but since the company is very early stage, 'employee' really does not make any sense because he won't be doing a particular task. So the question is what should i title this said guy who is not a founder/co-founder and won't be playing a key role in business development but still plays VERY important role in company, the first non-founder.

I know title is something that i should not worry about but there has to be something that i introduce him to every body with, that i tell my investors, that i tell him.

Also should i give him equity? if yest then how much? (I think i should give him equity but i would really like to know what you think, how much equity is something i don't know yet, i need help on it too)

Please help, it will be much appreciated

Thanks!

How about employee #1

A bit tongue in cheek, but hey it can be useful in conversations. I've learnt that humour goes a long way when trying to connect with people.
