I just redesigned my website and it's cluttered with information but it's all information I feel necessary to include so I think I need a second opinion.

What should I change about my website to make it a more effective platform for B2B sales? See  south-pak dot com.

There's always a test that I perform when reviewing websites for conversions. It starts by loading up your website, counting to two (2) and then hiding the site from view. Now I've got to try and remember what I just saw.

The general practice for conversions is to list out your conversions by priority. Take the number one conversion item and make it the biggest/most obvious item on your homepage, the second conversion is the second largest/obvious, third is third and so on.

So I should be able to recall what your number one conversion item is supposed to be. But honestly, the only thing that I saw was some kind of product image in the bottom right. However, that doesn't tell me anything about your business, or what you want me to do first.


**Your website totally failed the obvious conversion test.** 


Here's what I suggest. Trim back on SO much information on your homepage. Information is good, don't get me wrong, but it's gotta be in the right place. The homepage should have very defined product categories and possibly a couple featured products in a large slider.

<p>At the risk of being blunt, there is too much to fix to even go into describing it here. You need to find a UX designer. <em>(UX = user experience)</em> A UX designer is not just a programmer who is competent with CSS, they have a different skill set.</p>

<p>If you would like to learn yourself, I can suggest the books <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/073571410X" rel="nofollow">Defensive Design for the Web</a> and <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321657292" rel="nofollow">Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a>.</p>

You are correct Sir -- you have a tremendous amount of information, all of which is needed, and most of which is not presented in any sort of way to communicate and close a B2B customer. 

All of the piece are there. It is like a jig-saw puzzle. the question is how are you going to arrange them in a way that is appealing to a prospective customer. 

Whether you go to a UX designer as recommended by @Kenneth Vogt, or simply get a good website design to put the puzzle pieces together into a frame which will speak to the prospective customer in a way that allows you to drive sales.

Here are some things to consider:

 - Your home page is a landing page. It communicate a message and evokes a feeling. t provide a simple one click to the information people need. It doesn't need to answer all of their questions.
 - The home page can be augmented by landing pages which support specific marketing campaigns. 
 - The page needs to have some structure to it -- some clean columns and content windows that help order the eyes
 - A/B testing of specific designs for specific pages will allow you to choose the best one for your site.
 - Your home page is by far the worst, once someone gets into the rest of the site it gets better. that is good news for you!
 - I found it nearly impossible to figure out how to order -- or even get a bid -- from the site.  I am sure it was there -- everything else seemed to be! :)
 - Map out what you want customers to do when they come to the site-- and then make sure that the workflow of the site supports that. 


It seems like you have a lot of great product and I hope that you are able to find a way to present it to support your current business growth goals!
