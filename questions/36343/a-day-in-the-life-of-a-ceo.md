Does anyone know of a book that details the typical day to day routine of a CEO of a company? 

We all know the high level duties that a CEO must perform, but then I have yet to find good information on the actual things that they actually do on an hourly/daily basis so it'll be great to obtain some information in this area....

I think there may be books like this out there, but I doubt they would be useful for anything (other than anecdotal stories). A CEO is only as good as the team they surround themselves with, and in reality, the CEO will have extremely different workload, responsibilities, and tasks from company to company... 

Furthermore, this will change depending on how big the company is, what phase of production the company is in (are they about to launch a new product? are they about to file their quarterly results? etc). Also, some CEO's are extremely hands-on (think Steve Jobs), whilst others concentrate a lot more on the money side of things, leaving actual production and developments to their subordinates.
