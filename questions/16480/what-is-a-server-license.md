I'm planning on using MojoPortal CMS to make websites for clients. They offer this addon called [Form Wizard Pro][1] with three different license. I want a license so I can use in multiple deployment. Is a [server license][2] the right one?

A server licence is one that is for a physical machine.  Sometimes its calculated based on the actual physical or logical processors on your system.  So a company can ask you to pay $100 for each individual server, $100 for each individual processor, or $100 for each individual core.

Licencing varies per comapny.  I have seen a combination of client, user, seat, and server licencing on a variety of products.

The bottom line, as a start up you want to be as frugal as possible. Dont invest in something that you cannot afford.  

There are plenty of CMS solutions out there, much of which are free.  I find that if you are offering a SAAS you usually end up writing your own custom CMS for most of your clients, and that a full blown CMS is overkill for most of your regular users.

Best of luck..

How does this relate to startups?  Ask MojoPortal, they'll provide you support on their products.

**Read the license**, it's there in plain English:

> You may use and install the Software on all instances of mojoPortal running on a single production server, owned, leased or controlled by you. You may also use the software in development, testing or staging environments.

Yes, you can use it for multiple clients, if all are on the same server.  That said...

...are you insane in any way?^H^H^H *\**Turns snarkiness down, helpfulness up.\***

You are talking about basing your product on a closed-source solution not under your control.  This severely limits your value as a developer.

 - What's the point of hiring you if you can't customize the product for your clients?
 - You will be locked into a system that you cannot customize as a client's business or organization grows/changes.
 - Your ability to serve your clients will depend on what someone else does with their product, what they offer, what they don't, what they charge in the future.

Talk about putting control in someone else's hands!
