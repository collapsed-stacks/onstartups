I am launching a website. It will compete with one other website. The service will be identical for the most part, except my website will be superior in usability and I will also provide some extra little features.

Their website is a bit of a joke, but they have been running it since 2005. They have the whole market slice. Everyone uses them.

I am trying to get a part of that pie. I will be happy if I can get 10% of their customers 

Currently their customers are billed by debit. So basically the money is taken directly from their bank accounts. I consider this to be the biggest hurdle for me. I think I can get their clients to my website, but actually having them give me their banking details and having them ditch the other site, that might be tough.

So I am planning to do a 90 day free trial.

The reasoning behind it is that they will start to use my service, they will like it. Then some time during the first month they will cancel their subscription at the other site. Maybe they like my site more, or maybe they will just want to save money for 2-3 months.

At the end of the 3 months they will hopefully sign up with me.

Note: The operating costs of the website are incredibly low ($500/m) and won't increase with more customers.

Is 90 days overkill? I think it's necessary to "pry" the customers from the other site.

Of course 90 days period is long enough for trial. But there is another consideration in psychology. It's so long that clients will almost forget payment and think it should be free always. They may not feel happy when they need to touch pocket when time due.

A client who really want your product doesn't need such a long trial period. Maybe he would rather exchange this for other terms such as discount, free support etc.

I suggest to use a combination of promotion methods, and cut trial period to industry average. Your competitor doesn't have trial period, you've already excelled him.

Some examples of promotion combination:

+ Free trial (You have it)
+ Offer private discount when free trial expires
+ Public discount/coupon before certain date
+ Free premium support for limited time(may be useful for your industry)
+ More budget on ad

Feel free to add you own. A tool set is definitely much powerful than a strong tool alone.

For some industries you will find a lot of customers will only start using the system as the trial nears the end.  They are busy and it's not a priority, but as the trial is running out they better evaluate it properly.  

A 90-day trial could cause your sales cycle to be unnecessarily long for no gain.  They may still only use it for a few days before making a decision, but those few days will be 90 days later.  It's possible they will even forget about it by then or find something else and the 90 days could be more harm than good.

I would lean towards 30 days, I think it gives enough for free but also has that sense of urgency.

Also, you mention that your website will be more usable and you will have a few small features to be better than your competitor.  It will take more than that.  Customers won't move for a small improvement, they need a bigger reason to move.  Either a big improvement or be cheaper.  I am guessing you care more about how dated or usable a website is than they do.  You probably can't believe this competitor has so many customers considering how crappy their site is... it turns out... the site doesn't matter as much as you think.

Make sure you have a compelling enough point of difference to warrant the effort and risk of them moving across.
