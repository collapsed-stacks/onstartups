I've started an independent equity research advisory business. Since the research is to be delivered from online mode, the clients can be located anywhere. 

I already have the website. I am a researcher and don't have skills to scale up and market the business. Also, there are numerous regulations involved about which I am not aware; therefore the need for a good mentor. 

For more information, I am located in Canada and offering equity research for Indian stocks. 

How can I get connected with a mentor? I am ok if the mentor is located in Canada or I connect with him/her online in some other country. I contacted some government associations; however it wasn't of much help. The support by BDC, Enterprise Toronto and some other government programs is limited to making business plan and offering loans. Something that I am not looking for. 

Any suggestion would be appreciated.

<p>I know that David Vasallo of <a href="http://www.marketinformer.com.au" rel="nofollow">Market Informer</a> in Australia has been through a similar journey to the one you are on. He expanded his advisory business and has since contracted it again. I only know him as a client, so couldn't give you an introduction but I have talked to him personally and found he was willing to answer questions I had about trading.</p>

<p>You might want to look at the site and contact him with specific questions. Lots of people are willing to help if they are asked.</p>

<p>This is a little self promoting since I participated in 2010, but you should look into <a href="http://www.masschallenge.org" rel="nofollow">MassChallenge</a> 2011.  They're launching a new site in the next few weeks which will explain the competition more.</p>

<p>If you're accepted as a finalist, you recruit 1-3 mentors (in the Boston area and beyond) to help you during a 3-month accelerator phase.  We worked with some amazing mentors for our startup.  You also get access to free space in Boston.  In 2010 there was $1M in prize/grant funding awarded to 16 startups. Anyone from anywhere in the world can enter.  </p>

<p>If you have any questions about it feel free to contact me.</p>
