Pricing of app development depends on these factors:

 - the skills required
 - the amount of work to be done
 - the amount of time it takes
 - how soon the client wants it done
 - expenses incurred as part of the development process
 - competition for the job
 - final quality and completeness
 - whether payment is upfront, revenue sharing, or a combination of the two (probably all upfront in this case)

I really don't have a ballpark figure. Mass-market retail is a difficult business, and the people involved may not understand or care about mobile apps.
