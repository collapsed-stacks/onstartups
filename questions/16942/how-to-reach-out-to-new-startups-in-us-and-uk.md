We are a young startup calledhttp://smebackoffice.com/ where we intend to provide services to our target audience that is startups in US and UK who are young or just received a first round of angel funding.
We tend to work alongside these startups and help them execute their marketing plans in a cost-effective manner. 

Now we will like to know of sources like sites or any other reliable place where we can get info about these kind of startups and ways how we can contact the core-founding team and pitch to them about our services. 

if you were in my position what would you have done to reach out to the target audience?

Here are some sources:

1. Follow the [feed at CrunchBase](http://www.crunchbase.com/).
2. Make friends with the people at angel funds ([YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com/), [TechStars](http://www.techstars.org/), etc.) -- maybe you can offer them a great deal for the companies in their portfolios.
3. Track the SEC Schedule D filings, which should include most US startups that raised money using reasonable lawyers
