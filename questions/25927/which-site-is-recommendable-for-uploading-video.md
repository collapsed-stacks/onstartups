We are thinking to have an online channel for our videos. Which site would you recommend for this? What I have in mind right now :

- YouTube
- Vimeo
- Brightcove
- Ooyala

Really appreciate if you can share your experience with video sites.

Those would be the two that I recommend.

**YouTube** - 
Allows certain customization with your profile page, gets huge traffic in general and has listings that show up in the Google search results.

**Vimeo** -
Higher quality video player and is all in all cleaner compared to YouTube, especially with the crappy video ads from YouTube. It also has listings that show up in the Google search results, just not as frequently as YouTube.

Post the videos on both, there are different people that visit each. You can benefit from the added exposure.
