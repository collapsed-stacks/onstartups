Maybe someone has experience with this?  

I've been mulling this idea for an app that would really show off what's possible with a tablet like the iPad.  It doesn't exist yet, and I want it to.

I'm a developer, but not nearly a good enough one to do this project on my own.  

What's a good way to find a developer to collaborate with, while maintaining control of my idea/project etc..?

Do I need to write up an NDA?  Even go so far as to form an LLC?

Rather than scout co-developers for a joint project, you best bet and if you really believe in your idea is to hire more experienced developers to actually build the app for you.  You have a strong advantage based on your development experience, and you will learn more that it is more important to be an entrepenuer than a developer.

The fact is programming and technology changes all the time.  There are always talent you can recruit which will usually be better and more focused than what you could accomplish alone.  Learning to take an idea from that bubble in your head to the real world is the fun and valuable experience.  

I would suggest finding someone who has experience in building the app and hiring them.  As a developer you can provide a detailed technical spec which usually makes the job ea

You're a developer in an MIS program and there isn't one other student to partner with on this project? Look around for the smart kids and try to put together a study group or something to assess their ability. Do you feel you don't have enough expertise to complete certain parts of the application or do you feel you could not handle the size of the application by yourself? 

Start building something to show other programmers. Get a basic NDA to keep the honest people honest. Since you have no money to offer, you're going to need a little more to show potential development partners than just an idea. 

You won't be able to keep this a secret forever. Everyone at Harvard knew about Facebook; didn't do them much good. Nothing to stop others from copying it once you release. Be more concerned with your making it happen instead of worrying about someone else.
