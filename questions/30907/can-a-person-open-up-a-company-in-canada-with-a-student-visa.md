I think opening a company and working permission are separate things. You can open companies in the US and England without even being there, so Canada shouldn't be any different i would think. But again since you are on a student visa you can't work for your company.. you could hire Canadians or people in Canada with working visas though.

Actually you cannot form a business in Canada without having citizenship or permanent resident status. Your only option would for it to be registered under someone else's name until you manage to get residency.
