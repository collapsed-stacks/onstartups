I am thinking about working on a .com startup that involves providing a service to people or businesses via a web application. The service would store user data and information that a company might deem sensitive or at least not want to be compromised or lost.

What are my liabilities for protecting this data? Is this generally not a good idea? If I use another company for the storage of the data, like a hosting provider's database server or cloud storage, can I simply defer the liability to that company?

You can't defer liability -- that's what liability insurance is for. The level to which you go to protect your data depends on sensitivity of your data and sensitivity of your customers to a breach. Cloud and colo service providers should be able to provide you with a level of security that they commit to contractually (at least all the reputable ones will), and you can evaluate their fit for your needs based on that information.
