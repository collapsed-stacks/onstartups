<p>A quick search through google will find ton's of icons.  </p>

<p>Here's a royalty free <a href="http://www.visualpharm.com/must_have_icon_set/" rel="nofollow">set</a>, but it requires attrib.  <a href="http://stockicons.com/collections/" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> a company that charges, but no attrib needed. </p>
