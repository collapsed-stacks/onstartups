In 1911, as a result of Dolley's lobbying efforts, Kansas became the first state to enact a "comprehensive" securities law requiring registration of both securities and their salesmen. Dolley used the term “Blue Sky” in connection with promoting passage of the statute, and the term was used by those reporting on it. See “Joe Dolley Is After the Blue Sky Merchants”, Topeka Capital-Journal, December 22, 1910.
Dolley had complained about the ”enormous amount of money the Kansas people are being swindled out of by these fakers and 'blue-sky' merchants.' ": Letter from J. N. Dolley Dec. 16, 1910

Do you mean "blue ocean"?  That is more applicable to startups.

The term blue sky in securities has come to define securities fraud.  Specifically the term was used to describe the speculative and broad language used in certain sham investments.  

Below is a better explanation. 

Hope this helps,

Jason

This is from wikipedia:

> The origin of the term blue sky as applied to securities fraud requires further research. Its earliest cited use by the United States Supreme Court was in an opinion by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph McKenna in Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., 242 U.S. 539 (1917), a case that addressed the constitutionality of state securities laws. Oddly, McKenna is frequently (and erroneously) given credit for inventing the term, even though J. N. Dolley used the term when pushing for passage of the Kansas statute in 1910, and McKenna's own opinion in Hall itself attributes the term to an unnamed, earlier source:

> The name that is given to the law indicates the evil at which it is aimed, that is, to use the language of a cited case, "speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of 'blue sky'"; or, as stated by counsel in another case, "to stop the sale of stock in fly-by-night concerns, visionary oil wells, distant gold mines and other like fraudulent exploitations." Even if the descriptions be regarded as rhetorical, the existence of evil is indicated, and a belief of its detriment; and we shall not pause to do more than state that the prevention of deception is within the competency of government and that the appreciation of the consequences of it is not open for our review.

> Kansas banking commissioner Dolley, railing against "blue sky merchants" when pushing for passage of the Kansas statute in 1910, observed that certain fraudulent investments were backed by nothing but the blue skies of Kansas. The Oxford English Dictionary has a cited use dating to 1906. Also, The New York Times (and other national newspapers) frequently reported on the blue sky laws as various states began to enact them between 1911 and 1916. The newspapers expressly used the term blue sky to describe the laws.

<p>Actually...  </p>

<p>The term "Blue Sky" in regards to business acquisitions refers to the amount of money paid/requested (buyer/seller) for the "future earnings potential" of an existing business.  It is usually an interval of an existing business's current annual or average annual net profit.  Blue Sky is more common on franchised businesses (example: new car dealerships or major fast food restaurants etc.) or extremely well rooted successful independent businesses.  There are many factors that determine the amount of blue sky.  As an example a highly profitable Mercedes Benz dealership in a very desirable major market may go for 6-8 times it's average annual net profit.  In comparison an average profit Chevrolet dealership in a small town might go for 2-3 times its average annual net profit.  That is possibly a confusing example but the point I'm making is that there are many variables to evaluating "blue sky"; location, business, brands, financial history, future earnings expectations etc.</p>

<p>Example Sale...</p>

<p>Four components priced individually which when added up determine the total value/price of a business:</p>

<p>current market value of:</p>

<p>1.) Hard Assets (furniture, signs, equip, vehicles etc.)</p>

<p>2.) Real Estate (appraisal value)</p>

<p>3.) Inventory (at wholesale cost)</p>

<p>4.) Blue sky - value of the existing intangible business opportunity (usually 0-8 years worth of annual existing net profit depending on the business)</p>

<p>It's a management cliche that means something like "thinking outside the box" or long-term thinking focused on original ideas and questioning assumptions.  Instead of saying, "Let's build a better web site for banks" a blue sky approach might start with "What if every human being were their own bank" or "What if banks owned their own movie studios and newspapers, instead of web sites?"</p>

<p>Search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blue+sky+thinking" rel="nofollow">blue sky thinking</a> for more examples.</p>

<p>In acquisitions, I would guess that it means either a long shot, or a very foward-looking long-term plan.</p>

I think the short answer in connection with company acquisition is "promise of further growth" which makes buyers excited and willing to offer a higher price than the current profits justify.

<p>To elaborate on the car dealership example:</p>

<p>When you buy a Toyota dealership you will pay the summation of four individually valued components of the existing business.</p>

<p>1.) Real estate - @ appraisal value</p>

<pre><code> - Property
</code></pre>

<p>2.) Assets - @ current market value</p>

<pre><code> - Furniture, signs, fixtures, equipment etc.
</code></pre>

<p>3.) Inventories - @ wholesale value</p>

<pre><code> - Parts, new cars, used cars, supplies
</code></pre>

<p>4.) Blue Sky - @ Usualy a multiple of Net Profit</p>

<pre><code> - This is what you pay for the opportunity/legal right to be the Toyota dealer in that market.  Similar to a non compete.  You will also be able to sell this opportunity to the next potential owner someday.  It's otherwise known as business value.  The IRS recognizes blue sky and requires you to write it off over a 30 year period (which sucks).  Unless of course you can substantiate an instant reduction for circumstantial reasons.  Like if Toyota Motor Company (hypothetically speaking of course) went bankrupt you would have justification to write any blue sky/business value recognized on your balance sheet from acquiring a toyota dealership down to zero and reduce income for tax purposes.
</code></pre>

<p>Advice...  When buying a business try to get the seller to allocate as much as possible (of total purchase price) for tax reasons too:</p>

<p>1.) assets </p>

<p>2.) inventories</p>

<p>Then to:</p>

<p>3.) real estate </p>

<p>4.) blue sky</p>

<p>Note... This may not be applicable as ideal for every transaction, just as an example for majority.</p>

<p>Sorry; I don't mean to complicate the thread and/or original question, but I hope it helps further describe or help understand  "blue sky" In regards to business acquisitions.</p>
