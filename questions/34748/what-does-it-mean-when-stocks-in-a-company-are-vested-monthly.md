I was reading the top answer here:

http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/23461/what-do-you-need-to-pay-for-the-board-of-advisors-in-a-startup

The author was saying:

> In general, advisors get something between 0.1% - 1% of the company,
> vested monthly over 2 years.

I understand the concept of giving 1% of my company to an adviser. What I don't understand is "vested monthly over 2 years". What does that means? I have no idea...

Monthly vesting over 2 years means that every month the person receives 1/24th of the allocated stock shares.

If your stock grant to an adviser is 1% vested over 2 years and they leave after 3 months, then only 0.125% of the company belongs to them. If they leave after 1 year and 1 month, they keep 0.54167% of the total shares.
