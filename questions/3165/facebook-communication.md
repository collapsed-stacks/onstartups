How do I communicate with my fans so the message appears in their
News feed?

Inbox?

Wall?

I can't seem to figure out how to get them updates in a place they will notice.

The best way to communicate with your fans seem to be wall posts. They used to show on all your fans' feeds, but since the latest facebook redesign, a post has to be engaging enough (as determined by facebook) for the user to show on his feed. 

Post engagement for each user is calculated from a couple of factors:

 - overall popularity of the post
   (likes, comments)
   
 -  User engagement with the page -
   Whether the user has been looking on
   the page's wall, pictures, etc.
   lately, or commented or liked posts
   or pictures from this page.
   
 -  User's friends engagement with the
   current post and the page.

Try asking questions, or seeking opinions for maximum exposure.

Also when a user comments or likes a page post, there is a chance it will show up on his friends' feeds, without they being fans of your page.
