I have published an app to the android and amazon app stores and currently my app has a legal disclaimer (End Use License Agreement) as part of it that runs the first time the start up the app.  But my question is, is that needed?  When do you need a EULA and when do you not?  No one reads them anyway... but as a developer you need to protect yourself.  What are the general guidelines for when you should and when you shouldn't?   I did just because almost every other piece of software I have ever used had one, but I don't know why beyond that. Any help would be much appreciated.

Well as far as when to use it, the question is simple. ALWAYS!!!  
This explains to people what they can and can not do. Even if you distribute the software free, have your sources exposed, and put no restrictions on redistribution, just state that. Otherwise you're leaving things too open. People won't redistribute or extend for fears of copyright violation. On the flip side, not having one on a closed commercial app, opens the door wide open for someone to mess with the app, with no legal protections for you.
