I'm currently using @zeeenmedia because someone on the other side of the world has an account, used only intermittently, named @zeeen. 

Is there a good way to contact that user to work out a swap?

How have other startups handled this problem?

Why don't you DM them and ask?

It is a sign of the times though. Any new venture has to do a lot of name-checks to see if they are available. Used to be just the .com, now Twitter, Facebook, etc need to be free too.

In all seriousness if you own a trademark for zeeen then Twitter will release the name to you.

<p>Try to go after <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/neeez" rel="nofollow">@neeez</a>. It's catchy because it's @zeeen spelled backwards and judging by her tweets, it looks like she may be more open for a swap!</p>
