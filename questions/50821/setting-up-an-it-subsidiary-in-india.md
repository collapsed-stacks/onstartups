My contact in UK is starting a new software company in UK.  They want to setup an office here in Bangalore India.  Initially it is going to be with very minimal investment with 6 to 8 employees.  Is it required to register in STPI.  I was told that minimum export value should be of 1 crore to register in STPI.  How this export value is calculated and can i assume that STPI registration is not required if EOV is less than 1 crore per year.

Please advise.
