I think that a justified equity distribution amongst the co-founders is extremely important for the startup to takeoff, but tricky part is, how to go about doing it ?

I'm curious to know, how does it happen in the real world and with the most successful to good startups ?

Do the founders always take equal stakes ?  50-50 ?
or Do they divide stake based on the investment made by each founder ? experience ? monetary ?

and Is it wise to keep aside certain equity stake to be given away while growing the company ? 


Thanks

<p>If you have two co-founders that are going to put all their effort to the startup and neither of them provides significant seed capital, I don't see any reason not to split 50-50. It's a long road ahead and an initial investment of time and energy is insignificant compared to work that has to be done.</p>

<p>This was the case for us. I'd do 50-50 split also in the case that I would provide somewhat more seed capital than the other co-founder. </p>

<p>However, if one of co-founders brings a significant amount of seed capital into the company, it's a good idea to negotiate a valuation and take it in as you would take a seed investment from a third party. I'd probably still do a seed investment from a co-founder as an interest-bearing non-convertible loan.  </p>

<p>Btw. just Googled as I remembered Chris Dixon <a href="http://www.cdixon.org/?p=367" rel="nofollow">writing about this</a>. He gives some tips for unequal divides.</p>

<p>Lance Weatherby (an Atlanta entrepreneur guru) also <a href="http://blog.weatherby.net/2008/10/startup-equity-distribution.html" rel="nofollow">did a good writeup</a>.  He talks about figuring out the split, but also about setting everyone up on a vesting schedule to protect yourself against a co-founder walking away with 50% of the equity after 6 months of doing nothing.</p>

Technically, equity distribution is proportional to the "value contribution" by each stake holder.

In general, tangible contributions (investment, land, resources) are considered much more important than intangible contributions like experience/expertise.

Practically, when human factors step in, there will be a few adjustments and compromises to be made.

If its a capital intensive venture then may be you'll need to figure out the distribution early on. Here iron-clad agreements play a major role.

But if its just a few computers, less then 5 employees... it will be best that you forget equity distribution for the time being and let the business grow. Here, over the time you'll know who contributed what and hence the distribution.

<p>Equity splits among co-founders can be tricky when you bring in the "value contribution" as Aprit has mentioned in his answer. I wrote a post on this matter with a method that has assisted me in developing a more transparent guideline that can be used.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usmansheikh.com/finance/equity-splits" rel="nofollow">Calculating Partnership Equity Splits</a></p>

<p>Another factor that was brought up in the great post on equity splits by Lance Weatherby was on vesting schedules. I have a short explanation on that as well linked to the post above.</p>

<p>Hope that helps a little.</p>

Initially cut up the equity pie into 4 parts that will contribute to the future value of the company; Know-How/Technology, Seed Capital, Business Development, and Operations.
Then discuss, negotiate and agree upon the contributions (in %) of each co-founders on each quarter (25%) slice of the pie.
Each co-founder's equity can be calculated by the % of contribution multiply by the 25% of each quarter.
