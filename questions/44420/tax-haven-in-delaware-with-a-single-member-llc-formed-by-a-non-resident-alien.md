While I'm researching what I need to pay in taxes for my LLC formed in Delaware (I'm a non-resident alien from China), I found this page which is very interesting: http://www.webhostingtalk.com/archive/index.php/t-331329.html

Take this post for example,

It sounds too good to be true.

Considering this thread was 8 years old, my question is if this was true and if it was, does it still hold true today?

<p>You misunderstood the term "tax haven". The US doesn't tax income of foreigners who are not US persons for tax purposes, unless the income is "effectively connected" to the US activities or earned in the US. When I told you that tax-wise you'd be better of with an LLC rather than a corp - that was one of the things I had in mind.</p>

<p>But it doesn't make it a tax haven, you will still pay taxes in your own country. The LLC is a disregarded entity, so all the income (tax-wise) is in fact yours, not the company's. You're subject to your (Chinese, I guess) tax laws, and will have to pay taxes on the money accordingly.</p>

<p>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven" rel="nofollow">Tax Haven</a>" is a place that has legal infrastructure to "hide" the income from your home country taxes. The US is in no way a tax haven.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, as mentioned in the quote, the rule only applies to SMLLC (if you have multiple members, you're taxed as a partnership, and the rules change), and only if you have no income from the US. If your payments are done to your US-based PayPal account, especially if your customers are also Americans, it can be argued that this would be US income, and thus taxable for you.</p>

<p>Bottom line, <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/a/44361/13808">as I told you already</a>, trying to get "free" advices here will cost you significantly more than do proper planning with a professional. You're reading bits and pieces of information, but the tax law in the US is <em>extremely</em> complicated, especially with regards to foreign transactions. Do yourself a favor, and pay a good CPA for a proper consultation.</p>

It's tax HAVEN, not tax Heaven.

My tax lawyer tells me that any non-US citizen who is a member of an LLC runs the risk of being taxed at US earned-income tax rates on amounts earned through the LLC, so beware.
