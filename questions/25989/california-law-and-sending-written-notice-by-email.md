I've decided to ask this question here, as there is no better StackExchange site to ask and it's also not that much off-topic for OnStartups. 

I'm from Europe and I signed (by email) IT service contract+NDA with a California-based corporation (Inc.). The contract can be terminated by "written notice". That term is not defined in the contract, so I suppose that California and/or federal law applies. 

I scanned the statutes listed [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_signature), California Civil Code, rougly took a look at monstrous California UCC and although I think that written notice by email should be perfectly ok, I'm lost at the whole matter, especially that I'm used to continental law, not codified common law.

The federal "Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act" legislation says it's OK unless (...) UCC is involved, UCC seems to not cover my case, and California Civil code says that [written contract should be changed in writing](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=civ&group=01001-02000&file=1697-1701), but also that using [electroning means is ok if both parties agrees on that](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=civ&group=01001-02000&file=1633.1-1633.17)

So:

- are written notices by email enforceable?
- if they are not not - what's the best way to send such notice from EU to USA? I know about certified mail, but I haven't found any option to send it to from outside the US. Would it be enough if I used the "normal" international registered mail and they just confirmed me by email that they received the notice?

You can send certified mail from anywhere in the world, it's all standardized. You will receive an acknowledgement from your post office (ask for the option when you send the mail). This is the most bullet-proof option.

In practice, as long as you can show that you gave notice, and the other side received it, any judge will agree that it's good enough. So if you want to save on stamps, email and fax them your notice and ask them to confirm by email that they received it. Unless you are in a highly conflictual situation, they should oblige. Then you're good.

I don't think there is a definitive answer as to whether an email constitutes a writing.  I think that the answer is more practical than legal though.

For the most part, I would say notice by email is notice in writing unless the contract specifies how notice is to be provided.  In my job, I often provide written notice via email.  If the contract does not define "writing" and you send notice via email, I think it would be a very rare situation for a court to find that notice inadequate.  

In some situations, however, when the notice is more important, I will draft a letter, sign it, and send a scanned pdf.  If it is even more important, I will send a scanned pdf, and send a paper copy by FedEx (or UPS or DHL).  It only costs $20 or so to FedEx a letter so might as well if it is important enough.

In your situation, if you have a good relationship with the other party, you could send notice via email and offer to send paper notice if they want it.  They will almost surely say that email is good enough, and that seems like pretty firm ground to me.  If you have a bad relationship, then send a paper copy in addition to the email.

If you want to be safe send it registered mail since you are out of the US

My problems with e-mail notice are (a) one cannot be sure whether it suffices legally under many circumstances and (b) perhaps more important, one cannot count on receiving a confirmation that the addressee received the notice.

I vote for an international courier, such as FedEx or DHL, that provides confirmation of delivery that you can verify online.
