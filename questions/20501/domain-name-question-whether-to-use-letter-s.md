I need to come up with a domain name for my friend Peter's Lab.  I'm thinking whether I should use: 
peterlab.com or peterslab.com ?

Grammatically, I think "Peter's Lab" with an "s" is correct. However, I have a concern,  when people type the address, they may forget the "s", so should I stick with the one without an "s"?

What do you think?

I agree that peterslab.com is more correct and probably better.  If you're worried about people mistyping it, you could get both domains, set up the site at peterslab.com but set up peterlab.com to redirect.

You might also try to amp up the energy of the domain name (and possibly the business name) with a variation on the entire thing, like "PeteLab".

In theory, peterslab - we're all pretty good at mentally reinserting punctuation and whitespace (think onstartups, or stackexchange for instance!).

However, when I see p-e-t-e-r-s-l-a-b, the first way I see it is 'Peter Slab' - and that may not be so great. Clearly you can use capitalisation (OnStartups, PetersLab) to steer the reading.

So given the choices, peterslab is fine. Personally, I'd play with other naming possibilities to see if you can avoid the jarring ambiguity.

You should not worry too much about that and just make sure it fits what your logo (or company name) to be consistent. Why it doesn't matter? People will find you through SEO, SEM, Bookmark, X-linking deals, direct links, etc.. The number of people who will actually type letter by letter the name of your website will be minimal (way under 10%..)

so if your company is "Peter's Lab" make your domain "peterslab.com"

Cheers

Don't worry much about domain name and make sure that it fits to your company or not and also people don care about your domain name and they only care about whether they are satisfied by coming to your site or not .

Do this thing register both and port both the domains to same app and by this way you don have to miss any customer.
