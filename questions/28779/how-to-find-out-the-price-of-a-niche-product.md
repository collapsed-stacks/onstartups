we have a customer that's about to choose between us writing software for them, and a ready made solution. The market is investment banking, and we have the opportunity to staff people and grow our company thorugh this project.

We want to propose a two year project, but we need to be competitive on price. How do we get the prices our possible competitors are normally asking? We probably won't be able to get a quote from them, right?

Thanks.

You're a consultant for investment banking firms. Ask for a quote for one of your potential customers.

You could ask the customer to save you the trouble and tell you what they were quoted. Not sure how they plan on negotiating a price. They're just inviting you to make a very high offer knowing they'll want less. Eventually, they have to comeback with, I can get X amount of features for Y and then get your counter offer.

It will be tough to try to build a relationship with a company over the course of 2 years if they start out holding all their cards so closely.
