Is it normal to have to pay an investor fee just to meet with a potential investor?

This is a scam, run, run, run!  If I'm investing in your business *I pay you* for a stake in it... why would somebody who is supposed to potentially give *you* money charge *you!?*

It's not.  It's not unusual for a finder to want a fee for an investment that goes through, but it should only become payable once you have received the investment.
