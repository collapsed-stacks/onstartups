Was wondering if anyone knew of any site(s) out there that specialize in QAing sites for start-ups? Essentially doing quality assurance to test and find defects.

<p>One such website in the news these days is utest.com. They work on crowd sourcing model and I have seen rave reviews about it. (I am assuming here you mean functional testing only and not "white box" testing)</p>

<p>Check its review <a href="http://www.learnqtp.com/beginners-software-testing-jobs/" rel="nofollow">here</a> </p>

I agree that uTest is a great resource. Also, you should definitely ask people to check out and test your site on:

http://news.ycombinator.com/

http://linkedin.com/answers

I've used both sites to do just that and the response has been great. Below is a link to the feedback I got in a few occasions:

You could also try 99tests.com - recently launched and a pretty good tool to find out bugs.
