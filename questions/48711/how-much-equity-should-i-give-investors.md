I am seeking a $2M investment to take my patented product to the next level. I have been told my product is unique and can be used in a variety of industries by both commercial and residential users.

One third of the investment will be used on intellectual property to take out patent in various jurisdictions (20) which in effect covers just over 5 billion people of the world's population. I will also be using the funds for obtaining trademarks in each of these jurisdictions and the establishment of legal entities. 

One third will be used for manufacturing of products and the remainder to be used for working capital.

I have prototypes and potentially a huge market and although there are competitors, my product does much more than theirs providing many features that they are unable to provide and various more uses than their product. It is the Rolls Royce in its industry and yet comparably similar in pricing to produce and as such competitively priced.  

I do not want to sell my soul. I would also be seeking to eventually buy back the equity. How much equity do I give investors?

First of all don't consider investors as brainless money men. Most of them have high business skills and good market and government connections (at their industry). Since they think more financial than emotional, you can buy back their equity at any time if your offer seems good to them.

If you are not certain about details and how much does your Rolls Royce worth, put it on stand. Let interested investors offer you and you just choose the best offer. Probably one of current market players (in that industry) would be the best option. To my experience *some* patent holders over estimate value of their work and worst scenario happens when they find the real value too late (opportunity lost).

If you have paid for everything to date then you still own 100% of your company. Given what you have outlined, I would spit-ball the current, pre-money valuation of your company at $1,000,000 which would mean the $2,000,000 investment is worth 66% of the company.

The $1,000,000 is what I call "the magic number" It's high enough that you are rewarded handsomely for your time and effort, but low enough that it's still an attractive option for investors. If you don't have any customers and predictable revenue streams it is difficult to calculate a "real" valuation.

Spending $700,000 on IP seems like a lot of money for a start-up company. Supporting one Big Box retailer would more than take up the rest when it comes to financing inventory. This wouldn't leave you much room to grow.

You would probably be better off finding an existing company to license the concept from you. Let them worry about securing IP protection, manufacturing and inventory. You worry about cashing your check each month! If you can't find someone interested in licensing your product you may be hard pressed to build a market for it yourself. I know this wasn't part of your question but...

I think you are about to commit a big mistake if not already committed. There are many great inventions forgotten due to weak execution. You cant just build a factory, so that you build everything that can be built out of your invention. Yes you dont give it to big evil companies, but you are likely to end up with a product that has a patented thing that is awesome, but lacks quality and functionality on many other aspects, not to mention, that the manufacturing of your first factory is most likely to be very inefficient. The worst thing you can do is to jump into building a company around your patent. You cant build poles for IKEA and for firetruck ladders at the same time. telescopic poles are parts of products never the product itself. Every business willing to use your product will have their own vision of how it should be done.

Don't dilute an awesome idea with sloppy execution and **don't fool yourself to think that you are an entrepreneur, when you are really an inventor.**

You should licence your patent for a fair price to many companies, thats the only way to harvest its whole potential, since it has wide range of possible applications, some you would never even think of. And also you should never give exclusive rights to a company for the same reason.

If you agree, that my suggestion applies to your situation, you should reconsider how much investment you actually need. (maybe that 1/3 of 2m = $660k) and if your idea is proven to work, the investors should only get a very tiny fraction of income, since they dont take that much risk. you should even consider a regular bank loan, if you can work out a resonable business plan. 

Anyway common practice is that founders never sell more then 40% of they shares. VCs usually get around 1/3 of the company. And you should sell the tiniest amount of shares possible, only raise the money that is urgent (i.e. legal stuffs) since money slowly loses value, but those shares you keep for maybe 6 months, will be worth double the price when you get one step closer to profitability.

These are some of the things to consider in your situation. I hope you get the best out of your idea.
