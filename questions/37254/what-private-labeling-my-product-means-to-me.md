Question is kind of similar to this one: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/9799/someone-interested-in-being-a-private-label-marketing-partner-what-do-i-need

I have SaaS solution for specific industry. And my company is very small.

I was approached by big player in the same industry (competitor) but with much lesser product. They said exactly this: "We would like to present your product as ours. It will have to be private labeled".

I understand where they coming from. They, as a big company don't want to be reseller for me. But I'm not sure what I should take into consideration going into a deal like this. I definitely won't give them access to sources and will host service myself. Changing branding and maintaining will definitely take some resources.

From my standpoint - 50/50 split on income will make sense. They will sell and support. I will do support to THEM, not to end customer. And I will host and maintain service.

But I'm not sure if there is still catch in situation like this? How do we go about selling/promoting to the same customer? It's the same market.

Also, what IS private labeling? Is that like "COMPANY A" and fine print says "Powered by company b" or something else?

Yes, they want to sell your exact product under their name. It's best to say COMPANY A powered by if they agree. Many times they might want your company to be invisible to consumers.
