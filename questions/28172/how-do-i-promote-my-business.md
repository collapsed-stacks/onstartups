<p>"You don't build what you think is a good product, then try to get people to come to it. You first find an audience to validate your assumptions about there being a market for your product, then you build the solution they want/need.</p>

<p>This happens as you open your mouth, share your idea with whom you believe to be your potential customers, then based on the research and validation you get with this process, proceed to build the product they'll buy (assuming there is indeed a market).</p>

<p>It would be awesome if we could just build great stuff and on its own merits people would come and buy, but that's not the reality.</p>

<p>If you're not good at this sort of thing, you may want to partner with someone who is."</p>
