## Coaching - software company

I am interested in connecting with individuals who offer coaching services. The criteria I am looking to evaluate are:

1. Individual has lengthy experience in developing 1 or more web-based software companies, from start-up to becoming well established companies.
2. Preferably has experience in international business. 


I am interested in this because I recently landed my first executive role as a VP of Business Development working with a team of 5 people to grow this company. I could certainly use the guidance/wisdom of someone who has done this before, on a regular basis.

Thank you,

-Danny

Look for a mentor in a non-competing company/industry. Or someone who just sold a business, retired, etc. There are consultants with this expertise; not sure they are in the "coaching" business.

<p>I am reposting something I wrote in answer to another question on finding mentors <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/10586/online-startup-mentor/10611#10611" rel="nofollow">here:</a></p>

<p>Mentors definitely make sense.</p>

<p>One of the strategies that people who are really good at using mentors have is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify which specific skill they need mentoring in</li>
<li>Find someone who is excellent in that area</li>
<li>Find out specifically what that person does to be excellent</li>
<li>Try out the mentor's strategy in their own situation</li>
<li>Make any modifications or adaption they need to to make it their own.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool thing about this, is that you can have many different mentors and are not looking for the one perfect person who can mentor you through the whole process. It also eases the burden on the mentors and means most people are happy to help because they don't have to make a permanent commitment.</p>
