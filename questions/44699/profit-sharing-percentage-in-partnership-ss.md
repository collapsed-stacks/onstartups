I am starting an online service provider company along with a business partner of mine. Its to be precise require $150,000 capital and he his putting up every of the capital while i will be the CEO in charge of all the labour.
Capital sharing ratio is 10 to 0 (himself and me), while labour sharing ratio is 0 to 10 (himself and me).

My quetion is: How will the profit sharing ratio be calculated, as  i am the only one responsible for labour full time and my partner only contributing all the capital. And also whether its ok also to put myself on salary along with part ownership.
