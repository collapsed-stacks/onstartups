We have been approached by a potential client about whitelabeling and licensing our mobile app available on iTunes and Android stores. The app uses voip technology and the client will make money selling minutes to their end users. The client wishes to customise our existing app quite a bit. 

We would like some advice on the below

1. We will not be supplying source code so we don't think we should be charging full development costs of the app. Our plan is to charge a recurring monthly fee which will cover support and royalties and also a one off development fee to cover the cost of the extra customisation.

2. To charge royalties we would need to know how many users are making calls using the app, then we could charge per user. Are there any licensing tools for mobile apps to measure active users etc.  Also as we will be handing over the app binary to the client how do we ensure the client pays us monthly.

3. If we develop the whitelabel app for the client under the above arrangement who owns the copyright to the app. The app will be distributed by the client under their own branding on the iOS and Google Play stores.  

Any help appreciated
Thanks

If I was you, I'd be looking to:

a) have the company pay you to develop the customisations they require

b) you build in analytics to your servers

c) they pay you a monthly amount for making this app available to them, with an additional amount per user/minute/whatever

d) the app is deployed to the app stores, they do the marketing

e) you send a monthly invoice for the "lease" and the previous month's usage.
