<p>Is there a platform on the net where people can share their business ideas (at a concept level - not just the crude idea but also their visions about capital raising, business model, consumer response, management, etc) and give each other feedback?</p>

<p>We have platforms and forums for web designers to peer showcase their work and receive valuable feedback, we've got the same for visual artists but I find it hard to stumble upon such for aspiring entrepreneurs. </p>

<p>(By the way, such a platform could be useful for mature entrepreneurs as well, when starting a new product line/ a new branch of their business, etc.)</p>
