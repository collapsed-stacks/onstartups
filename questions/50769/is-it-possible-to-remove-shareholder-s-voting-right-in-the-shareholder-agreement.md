For instance, if a shareholder commits a crime and should subsequently be restricted from attending any meeting of the shareholders or voting their shares, can such shareholder's privileges be revoked in the Shareholder Agreement?

Thanks in advance for any advice on this issue.

You'd need to get proper legal advice.

As a businessperson, I think you could probably define the concept of a 'Shareholder in good standing' in a Unanimous Shareholder's Agreement (where you all unanimously agree to abide by these non-standard rules).

You can only do this with unanimous consent. Trying to do it after the fact won't work.
