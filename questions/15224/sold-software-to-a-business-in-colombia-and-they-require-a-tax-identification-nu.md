We've sold some software to a business in Colombia, and to pay the invoice they require a tax identification number (they call it a NIT). Does anyone know where I can obtain one or obtain a form to show we're exempt? We're not based in the US--we're in Europe--and when we sell to the US, we supply a [W8-BEN (pdf)](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) which shows we have no tax ID and don't collect tax. Does anyone know if Colombia has anything similar? 

I have looked myself, but the language barrier and navigating Colombian web sites isn't easy...

We sell software to Colombia all the time and have never been asked for a tax identification number.

<p>For whatever reason, you can give them a tax ID whether they really need it or not if it will make the sale. You can get a tax ID free and (I believe) today, even as an individual doing business, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=102767,00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Then you can give the customer what they want, which is usually a good idea.</p>
