A music blog aggregator to be specific, similar to Hypem.com, I wish I could customize Hypem.com with my own list of music blogs, but since I cant I was wondering how much work would it entail in me just creating a simple website where I can listen to music exactly from the blogs I want. 

Any smart developers have a clue and or open source code :)

<p>There are better places to ask this question, but maybe you could use <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Pipes</a> to combine the feeds from the blogs that you are interested in.</p>

<p>The only web aggregator that I know of is <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/" rel="nofollow">Planet</a>. </p>

<p>I have used different plugins for WordPress. They basically give you possibility to add RSS feeds and create automatically posts from them with some additional customization. For example
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedwordpress/" rel="nofollow">FeedWordPress</a></p>

Planet is the way to go if you want *just* content aggregation.

If you want your site to do other things, too, or you need more sophistication than grabbing everything from a list of feeds and listing it, you'll probably want to look at one of the many CMSes that have feed aggregation as an option. [Drupal](http://drupal.org) is my preference, but I work with it for a living, and am very involved in the Drupal community, so I may be biased. :)
