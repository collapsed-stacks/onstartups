We've just finished our website for 2010 and bar a single spelling mistake that will be fixed in the next day or so we need to know what we need to do to improve our site.

Any opinion will be taken seriously and all are appreciated...

thanks in advance.

I would say the main thing that I noticed about your site is the **lack of consistency**. Your business seems to lack focus on a particular area of expertise. Within 1 minute on your site I still couldn't tell what exactly your business does. At the first sight, I thought it was an iPhone development shop, but that doesn't seem to be the case as you seem to offer all possible IT related services to business, education and "web".

You should rework the navigation and perhaps, rethink what your core expertise is. Also, the line-height in the menu is very odd, you should leave it at the default value.

That being said, good luck with your business !

My thoughts: 

1. Reduce the speed of transitions on you slideshow. Its way too fast, and gives no time to the reader to process the info. 10 - 12 secs, should be good, 7 secs is too low.

2. I read the word "Guaranteed", whats the guarantee, and how can a visitor know about it within 30 secs of going to the website, preferably above-the-fold! The link does not help, since it goes by too fast, and I actually had to make an effort to notice that the cursor changed on the slideshow.

3. You need more "calls for action", also something that stands out on the slideshow itself to let the visitor know that they can click-thru.

4. You should consider moving the "contact imrion" link from below the slideshow to the top right hand corner (above the search) also if possible display your phone number there.

5. Consider making the links below the slideshow stand out a little(lot) more, it is getting lost, in the similarly styled text.

6. Remove the blog section(page) if you are not using it from the nav menu. 

7. Search boxes are great, but are also among the least used, since most sites do not have enough content to search through, add it back when you have more content, but for now there is a lot of stuff that you could use that prime real estate for. If necessary use a search widget for the sidebar/under the fold.

Thats all for now :)

cheers!

Get all text on your site professionally proofed.  I noticed numerous grammar and consistency errors.

Make sure all of your links work (I did not click through the entire site but your Legal Notice and AGB links on the bottom are not linked to anything).

My thoughts:

* The copywriting could be better. You also need to keep SEO in mind, which brings me to my second point.
* Maybe you haven't gotten around to it yet, but the site is lacking the basics of SEO. Work on the page title, description, header and content for each of your pages. Use canonical URLs, not ?page=XX.
* The grey text could be darker for better readability.

Hope this helps.

Cheers

It needs a lot of work - especially if you are trying to sell your services as a web presence creator. 

Specifically, there are far too many spelling and grammar mistakes for anyone to take the site/your company seriously.  

The content and dialogue seems very immature and too informal.  (IMO)  Not that I am in favor of corporate speak - in fact you ave a bunch too much of that as well.

SEO, SEO, SEO.

Homepage Title tag is in a sense missing.  Seems to be the default TLD.  The URLs are sloppy and there is no Alt or Title text anywhere.  

Oh and once you finish the onpage side of things, then you need to start doing some backlink building.

On hiding information from Google, you may want to rethink the wording, as Google isn't stealing content, and since any company can easily setup a robots.txt file Rupert Murdoch is trying to create a justification for trying to go back to charging to read his content, which will mean he may as well shut down the Fox News website, as few will most likely pay for it (it was tried early on, failed).

You may want to either give an indication which country you are in, on the front page, as I didn't realize that the country code would be 353.

Others have pointed out the language problems so I won't, but the gaps between lines on the menu items when there are multiple lines in an item seems too large.

For iPhone apps it would be useful if you had examples of what you have done, since you tout that you have been using Macs for almost 10 years and have considerable experience with iPhone development.

Focus first.

I think the first step is for you to figure out what you want to do.
You can not be everything to everyone. (You claim creative, IT support, custom iPhone apps, business consulting, management consulting, partner deals, and on and on)

Once you have that figured out then your site can really be evaluated based on your area of specialty and expertise.
