There are thousands of books out there that tell us about all kinds of successful and inspiring companies, and why they are successful. 

But what about promising companies that failed in the first two years, and why they failed? 

Do you have recommendations on good books dedicated to failures?

<p>The classic book on a software failure is the one done about Netscape. <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0684863456" rel="nofollow">"Competing on Internet Time"</a> is an amazing inside look at why Netscape failed in its battle with Microsoft.</p>

<p>I tremendously enjoyed this book and learned a lot about what can be done wrong from it.</p>

The movie *Startup.com* has some good insights about reasons businesses fail too. I highly recommend this documentary.

<p>How about <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590597214" rel="nofollow">"In Search of Stupidity: Over Twenty Years of High Tech Marketing Disasters"</a></p>

<p>Is on Joels 'product manager reading list' I believe - basic premise is that nearly all hi-tech/software companies fail because they do something very very stupid. If you look at Microsoft they have a lot of head slapping moments, but have done nothing catastrophically stupid.</p>

<p>One of the most popular books describing a failed startup is... "<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0140257314" rel="nofollow">Startup</a>" by Jerry Kaplan. It tells the story of the first pen PDA, competing with Apple and Microsoft, and ultimately failing with all kinds of boardroom drama.</p>
