I have a paid B2C web app. I'm currently running a trial model but I'm working to convert it to the Freemium model after evaluating the potential gains and losses.

Although my conversion rate is low, I believe my product is viable because I already have 9 paying subscribers since I launched it in early June.

What I really need now is to drastically increase my site traffic to scale it. Currently, I'm getting 100 unique a day. 

My short-term goal is to achieve 1200 consistent daily unique. My long-term target is 2500 daily unique which will satisfy my revenue goal for this niche startup so I can fund a more ambitious project, assume my current conversion rate can hold up.

I tried inviting bloggers to try my products but didn't get much replies. I achieved better result by going to forums to solicit feedbacks. However, many places disallow marketing even though I was willing to offer free access to their members.

I could try to write blog posts but I doubt there is much I can write about related to my niche. I want to give to the community but not sure what I can give. 

Any other marketing ideas?
