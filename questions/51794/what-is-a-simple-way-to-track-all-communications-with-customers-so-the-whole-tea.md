<p>I work with a small startup. Unfortunately, our small team is spread all over the world at the moment. As a project lead, I find it difficult to accurately develop features when I have little insight into what real customers say and do with our product. </p>

<p>I'm looking for something that will allow our sales team to continue to send emails and gain leads from our website, but at the same time allow me to read these communications to make better product development decision. I looked at Salesforce CRM and a few other CRMs. They look like they might be what I need, but they also look quite complex. I'm hoping for a simple fix until we have enough time/money to implement something larger like Salesforce.</p>

<p>Any advice? </p>

<p>Maybe a customer support app, like ZenDesk? It would keep track of any emails your customers are sending to your email address.</p>
