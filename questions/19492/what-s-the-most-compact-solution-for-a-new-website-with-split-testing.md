I meet a lot of wantrepreneurs who are very smart but not at all into the plumbing of websites. They totally get concepts such as minimum viable product and split testing, and they want to be hands-on with the propositions and the copy. But definitely _not_ with the pipes and joints.

As a recovering programmer, I tend to shy away from all-in-one web solutions. Even if they solve my problem today, I can always see how just around the corner I'll need more than is on offer. So my default answer involves them finding a friendly web developer, a CMS with a ready market in custom skins and some best-of-breed solutions to manage basic analytics and A/B testing.

That's still my answer for established products and services, but for new stuff... well, I'm not so sure.

So what are:

* Existing all-in-one answers for CMS with full analytics and split testing?

* _Genuinely_ simple, robust combination solutions that don't require geek skills to manage?

If you'd like a concrete example, take this one: a dental practitioner, who wants to branch out into some value-added services promoted online - _very_ bright, but very definitely never wants to see a line of HTML or javascript!

Performable's 'Marketing CMS' is the nearest I can think of, but it seems to me over-rich in features and over-expensive for this kind of startup.

<p>Dharmesh's <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/" rel="nofollow">HubSpot</a> is the only more or less startup friendly CMS with deep analytics I can think of. Then there are tonnes of high-end CMS systems (Vignette etc), which can integrate with high-end analytics like Omniture. They all have a learning curve like a brick wall, a price that is off the charts, and far fever features than you would expect given the price.</p>

<p>For just pushing web pages, without the deep analytics part? Hosted Wordpress, <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" rel="nofollow">SquareSpace</a> etc.</p>

<p><strong>The "CMS that just works, has all required features, and has a low learning curve" isn't invented yet. Seriously.</strong></p>
