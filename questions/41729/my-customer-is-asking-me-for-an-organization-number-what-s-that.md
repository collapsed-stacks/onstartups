A first-time European customer is asking me for an "organization number" to enter me into their accounting system. Is this a standard term? Is this my (USA) Federal Tax/Employer Identification Number? Or, am I free to make up any number? Or, is there no enough info to understand what's going on here?

It is a number used in Europe that isn't applicable in the US.  Just tell them that you are a US company and don't have one.  It happened to me once and they were fine with that.

Making up numbers is rarely a good idea.
