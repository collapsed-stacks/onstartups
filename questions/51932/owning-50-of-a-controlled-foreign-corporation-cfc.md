<p>I am resident in the USA.</p>

<p>If I hold 50% shares on a foreign corporation in a beneficial tax regime, according to the US CFC rules I will own a controlled foreign corporation (CFC).</p>

<p>Would I be liable for tax on the 100% income earned by the company or just on my share of the corporation?</p>

<p>On the share that is liable, would I pay US corporate tax? Or would I pay tax as US individual on that profit (such as dividends)? Could I take tax deductions on my share?</p>

<p>CFC related rules are complicated, and penalties for non-compliance are steep. I suggest hiring a professional (EA or CPA licensed in your state) who has experience with CFC and other international issues (including tax treaties relevant to the countries involved).</p>

<hr>

<p>You would file <a href="http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i5471/ch01.html" rel="nofollow">form 5471, and probably be a category 4 or 5 filer</a>. You can start by reading the instructions I linked to that form, and try figuring the answer to your question out. I would suggest <strong>not</strong> trying this on your own.</p>
