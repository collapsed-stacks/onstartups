Two month ago I've joined with two friends to build a startup.
I came with the idea and we started working. Two weeks ago, the first partner left the project due to lack of time.
The second partner is not progressing with the project, postpones his tasks and so far seems to be great in giving original excuses.

We haven't signed a legal agreement, nor explicitly agreed on any kind of control/share division.
So far, the only funds placed into the startup is the purchase of the domain name. I've paid for it myself and it is registered to my name.

From day one I feel like I've been pulling this project on my own: design, development, etc.

I fear his lack of commitment will be the downfall of a potentially successful business.
My question is, how to remove the remaining partner from the startup?


Thank you.

Important: This not legal advice . . . Get a Lawyer to help you - this a very common issue.  Things to note: 1) The fact that you have not signed a legal agreement or expressly discussed on how to share control/etc is not really all that helpful for your cause. A "partnership" can be created by mere actions alone (which seems to be the case here), 2) while you may be able to legally oust an unwanted partner from a partnership (especially if they are not keeping up their end of the bargain/contributing to the partnership), your legal remedies are not always the best actions to take.  From the limited facts, the best approach may be to simply approach the partner and offer to compensate him for his efforts so far (with cash) or strike some type of deal. Make sure you get a receipt! (i.e., make sure you have paperwork to account for his sale of any interests in the partnership)
