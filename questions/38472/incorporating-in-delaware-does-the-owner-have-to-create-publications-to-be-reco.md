I'm planning to incorporate in Delaware. But not sure If from the start I have to create an x amount of publications to be recognized in the state as an LLC.

 I incorporated an LLC In NYC and it was a must from the start to have an x amount of publications to be recognized as an LLC by the state. It can be very expensive (it can easily be in the thousands).

If possible, I don't want to do any publications this time around. I just want to incorporate smoothly and just worry about my business.

If you read Delaware State law on LLCs, you'll find that there is no publication requirement.

NY State law has this requirement:

You'll still have to pay annual renewal fees. Make sure to keep track of filing deadlines.
