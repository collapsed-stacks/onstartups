<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

Recently I have write a Android app and I think I am in the stage called promoting. I really think I have make a decent app, but few people knows it (they all think my app is great/good). I have already submitted it to several app review sites but no responses until now.

I enjoy reading LifeHacker, and I want to have a chance to get reviewed on it. But how? I cannot find a link to summit my app, should I email them directly?

And I know there are just a small chance to get reviewed by them. What should I do then?

Thank you for answering
