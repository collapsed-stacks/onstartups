I've just finished the excellent [Inbound Marketing][1] book of Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah. I would like to implement some of their proposed strategies about social network marketing, like creating a Facebook Fan Page, Twitter account or Linkedin profile. 

I'm the owner of Zoomission.com, a construction and renovation quote portal for English and French Canadian consumers that need to find great contractors.

My question is, how should I create Facebook Fan Pages to support multi-languages content? Should I create multiple fan pages? Should I create multiple Twitter accounts also? Should I have an English and a French blog? If yes, how can I maximize SEO and keep content clear for the users? Ex. facebook.com/zoomission, twitter.com/zoomission... What are the best practices regarding Inbound Marketing and content localization?

Thanks,

I don't have any direct experience with multiple language support in social media sites.

One thing I do know (and will echo Montana's thoughts here) is to ensure that you really have the resources to maintain a presence and build a community in two different locations.  For most startups, just keeping up with one presence on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn is a decent amount of work.  I'd try to pick one point of focus to start and worry about layering in the other language over time.

But, I don't know your business, so that might not be an option.

## Separate Twitter Accounts ##
Twitter is a tool for conversations; even if many of the tweets are starts of conversations your followers choose not to join. What will turn followers off, though, are tweets that start conversations they *can't* join, because they don't understand them. I'd have an @Zoomission account, and an @ZoomissionFr account.

## Multi-Language Blogging with Wordpress ##
For your blog, I know Wordpress can do multi-language support; you'll need to do some research on how to best implement it, since ideally you want to be able to provide a human-written translation, that's displayed automatically based on the IP address of the visitor (or by choice, for french-speaking Canadians), with minimum variation in the URL, for SEO purposes (e.g. www.blog.com/category/post-title-goes-here?lang=fr vs. www.blog.com/francais/category/post-title-goes-here).

## Facebook, Priorities, & Effort of Localization vs Translation ##

I'd agree with dharmesh that keeping up multiple presences takes a lot, but I'd disagree about the priorities of locations first, multiple languages later. Try multiple languages via the two twitter accounts (which I think will get you more results than a Facebook fan page anyways), and use them to get a feel for what effort is required for even short-form multilingual content. See if translating content you post on one account is enough, or if you're finding that people in different areas / part of different networks based on language respond better to totally different content.

Interesting questions, I would pick one main language but the real choice is up to you.  But can your company handle managing them effectively?   I would keep your inbound links categorized by language as well to simplify measuring the results.

<p>I've seen some companies use one single account and post content in both languages (i.e: <a href="http://twitter.com/CanadiensMTL" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.com/CanadiensMTL</a>). </p>

<p>Perhaps you should start with one single bilingual account and eventually start branching into language specific accounts whenever you get a large enough amount of followers that would justify the added overhead.</p>

<p>Bonne chance avec ton startup !</p>
