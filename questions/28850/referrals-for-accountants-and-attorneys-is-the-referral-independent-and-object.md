When team building, most business partners such as your accountant, insurance provider and attorney are referred to the organization.  

How "on-point" are these referrals in cases where the reference lacks independence and objectivity?  How well do Companies evaluate and monitor these relationships?

The quality of the referral is no greater than the quality of the referrer. If I have had years of great experience with my attorney and he refers me to an accountant, likely the accountant is good as well. However, if some guy I meet at a red light refers me to an accountant, there is little reason to believe that accountant will be better than one pulled at random from a phonebook.
