I am master student in computer science. I will graduate in May. It's been exhausting for me trying to get a software engineer job. I think it will be easier to just start with an internship. 

Is there a place that list startup internships?

I mentor a couple of undergraduates. Beware of the fly-by-night start-up companies looking for (under)graduate students interns for free or inexpensive labor. Do thorough homework on any start-up you're looking to intern with and ask exactly what you'll be doing.

Especially be cautious of any internship program where the owner(s) will ask interns to sign a non-compete and/or non-disclosure agreement.

What city are you located in? Our company has posted internships in Boston recently on the sites below. If you're located in Boston, send me a message.

- Internships.com
- SimplyHired.com

Other ways

- Go to programmer meetups
- Reach out to startups in your area
- Find a product you like and offer to help
- Start hacking for fun on Open Source projects (Wordpress, Drupal, etc) to build your resume and gain exposure

 And I agree with Michael, you should post this on programmers.stackexchange.com

You could use the interships.com site that has recently been made famous by Charlie Sheen

Here is the Social Media intern job that he is hiring for

http://cs.internships.com/charlie-sheen-internship/?adly_id=1373351728 

Apart from this job, I think there maybe a few applicants, there are many others worth taking a look at

You should have no problem getting something.  I can't think of a particular job board or the like, but startups would LOVE interns.
