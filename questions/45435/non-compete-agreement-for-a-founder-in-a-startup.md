Our startup currently has 5 founders, we're still in the process of seeking seed funding but we have all been working for sweat equity for the past 12 months, some founders have worked longer for sweat equity then others. 

I've been working without a salary now for about 5 months and I'm being asked to work another 3-6 months without a salary. I'm responsible for about 70% of all the code that has been written thus far and the company is a software based B2B2C business that involves many business relationships. I'm now being asked to sign a non-compete/non-solicitation agreement in order to receive equity in the company. I currently own the IP to all the code I've written since I haven't signed any agreements. Should I sign a non-compete agreement in order to receive equity even though I'm not receiving a salary now?

If it matters I'm in Ontario, Canada.

<p>There seems to be a few things in play here:</p>

<ol>
<li>equity assignment</li>
<li>code ownership</li>
<li>non compete agreement</li>
</ol>

<p>Do you currently have any agreements regarding equity for the time you've already put in?  That - and an acceptable distribution amongst the 5 founders - seems to be the first thing. Everyone should have non-competes - not just you. </p>

<p>Code assignment: That's your call.  You can grant the company non-exclusive rights - but you need to craft it in a way that doesn't torpedo investment opportunities.  Trading a larger equity component to assign exclusive rights is also a strategy.  </p>

<p>Unclear if the other 4 are not being paid, but 11+ months without a salary (or agreement) is a bit long.  Using <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6949/forming-a-new-software-startup-how-do-i-allocate-ownership-fairly">this post as a reference</a>, consider negotiating an appropriate rate with repayment after investment.  </p>

The last thing young entrepreneurs want to do is hand hundreds / thousands of dollars over to an attorney for a start-up.  It is an expensive lesson to learn the hard way.

If you are not involved in the formation of this entity, then you can be sure you will be treated as an employee and not as an owner.

I agree with Tom -- you're looking for a percentage of entity ownership and the value of your time --  I would not sign anything nor continue work without getting in front of YOUR attorney first.
