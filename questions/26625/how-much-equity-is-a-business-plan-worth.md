Say one person comes up with the idea for a startup, and spends a significant amount of time over 2 years developing the business plan. That person then asks others to join the startup as co-founders to help build the startup.

When allocating equity to each co-founder, how much equity is that existing business plan worth?

The person who wrote the business plan is the startup's CEO.

The business revolves around a website marketplace.

The business plan includes:

 - multiple lucrative sources of revenue
 - a basic plan for user acquisition
 - identification of additional roles that will need to be filled
 - financial projections
 - detailed, yet incomplete, explanation of the website's functionality
 - some [validated learning][1] (as Jesper referred to)

The other co-founders are the CTO, the front-end designer and coder, and the artist.

<p><strong>Honestly?</strong></p>

<p>Between zero and maybe 5% of the initial shares -- and 5% is on the high end, for a really extraordinarily good effort. In most cases, I would say a business plan is worth nothing at all.</p>

<p>By business plan I assume we mean ... the usual business plan. 10-15 pages of text with good market research, a loose idea about what the final product should look like, a pretty good expenses forecast, and dreams about funding and income.</p>

<p>Now, if the business plan actually contains what <a href="http://lean.st/principles/validated-learning" rel="nofollow">Lean Startup practitioners call "validated learning"</a> and even has some pilot customers lined up, then it might be worth more.</p>

<p>If you're going into this as a founder, then you should look to justify your share allocation based on the value you're bringing to the startup <em>going forward</em>. Not on a business plan, which is a piece of paper which will soon need to be changed.</p>

Two years on a business plan is... Wow. Mind-boggling. I can't imagine how far you'd be by now if you'd actually executed.

IMO, business plan **preparation** is worth near to nothing with respect to common stock distribution amongst founders. Primarily because the plan shifts often in most startups. However, maintaining and executing against a current, loose business plan is worth something, though, and the two should not be confused. (Also, the vision is worth something too. The individual(s) who came up with a well-conceived, original idea should get some recognition for it in the distribution.)

I think there's a kind of weird collective behavior I've seen in almost anyone I've worked with: Most people I've dealt with expect a business plan, but put no faith in one, for a variety of valid reasons. Never figured out why, but I do call it the "Safety Blanket Principle"...
