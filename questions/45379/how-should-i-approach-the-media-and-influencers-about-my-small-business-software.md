I recently spoke to the Director of Sales of a new, successful CRM software. He said a key part of their marketing is PR and getting the media to talk about them.

We're building a software for small businesses, and I want to incorporate PR into our marketing. I'm compiling a list of influencers of who I need to reach out to. The list would include magazines, bloggers, trade associations and freelance journalists/software reviewers. But I'm not sure how I should approach them.

Should I just come out and tell them my intentions?  I'm sure they get too many people looking for press, and it seems too one-sided also. How do I make this a win-win interaction?  Or what should my approach be?

<p>There are two things to keep in mind when you want to get a journalist/reviewer/blogger/etc to talk about you:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Make a personal connection</strong>.  These influencers get a lot of emails demanding their attention, and the best way to differentiate yourself from the spam is to show that you're interested in them.  Follow their blog/twitter feed/column for a while.  Mention a favorite post/tweet/article in your email.  This indicates that you're a reader, that you know who they are and what they typically talk about.</li>
<li><strong>Make it worth their time</strong>.  Use the knowledge you gained from following them to send them information they actually care about.  So if you're contacting a blogger who has never done a product review don't ask for one now - instead, offer to do a guest post on something related to their typical content.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a ton of really useful articles on the web about this exact topic.  Some of my favorites:</p>

There is some PR that you or your staff can do yourselves. You can do the following:-

1. Talk about your product in forums that are relevant

2. Establish yourselves as experts in your space by answering questions / contributing to the knowledge base. There are several Q&A sites that have come up that you can post on.
