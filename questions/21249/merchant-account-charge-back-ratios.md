Anone familiar with the charge back ratios for merchant accounts?

I am starting a monthly re-occurring billing service that will no doubt have lots of charge backs from customers.  I'm trying to figure out whether or not I need to go with a high risk merchant that takes a higher percentage, or to go with a "normal" domestic based merchant.

Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks!

 - If you are a B2B merchant, your
   chargeback ratios will (should) be
   near zero.  
 - If you are selling
   directly to consumers, your
   chargeback ratios will go up.  
 - If you
   are selling luxury items that people
   would like to buy with stolen credit
   cards (electronics, equipment,
   jewelry), your chargeback rates will
   be very high.
