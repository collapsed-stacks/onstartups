I'm extremely interested in this artist: [Breisa][1]. Her artworks are really good, and I'd like to commission her. Has anybody ever tried commissioning on deviantart before? How did it go? Were the artists in deviantart good? I'm really interested, but I'm afraid to put my money on the line since its my first to try online transactions.

She seems to have a good transaction record http://breisa.deviantart.com/journal/20348349/ 

and her terms seem straightforward - any reason why you would think that there would be a problem?

<p>Deviant Art is a <em>big</em> community, and a very mixed bag. But as <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/18434/should-we-hire-a-marketing-firm-to-spearhead-our-startup-go-live-campaign">I mentioned here</a>, I find it a great place to go to connect directly with talented designers. You need to do your research, and pay attention both to the quality of the work and the way the designer engages with other people.</p>

<p>If you want a more mediated experience, places like <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/" rel="nofollow">CrowdSpring</a> and <a href="http://99designs.com/" rel="nofollow">99designs</a> let you set up your requirement as a contest for multiple designers.</p>

My experience with Deviant Art and commission works has been mixed. This all depends on what exactly you are going to have commissioned of course.

If this is a long term contract your after, then my suggestion is to to a trial piece of work. If it works out, then do more. Take special care to see how they communicate with you and what their work ethic is like.

If the goal is a one time commission, then I would take a serious look at the user experience between Breisa and others users on Deviant Art as Jeremy P has pointed out.
