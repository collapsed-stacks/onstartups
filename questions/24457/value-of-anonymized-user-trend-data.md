I was wondering how to find out how much the user data is worth for a database similar to Foursquare's? I'm not looking to sell personal user information or email addresses, but more along the lines of: 

"18 yr old males who visit Vietnamese restaurants once a month also goto the movies once a month" 

"Females above 30 yrs old tend to eat out less than 4 times a month"

"Coffee restaurants in the core of Toronto tend to have more tech-savvy visitors on the weekends"

I recently talked to an angel investor about my company and he mentioned that this is the best way to make money in this space (location based services), but I'm having a lot of trouble learning about what data is relevant, has the greatest monetary value, and what exactly is legal/illegal (In Canada & the US)?

Is there a specific name for the industry of selling/buying "trend data". Are there specific companies that would buy this type of data? Is it typical for web-based or customer loyalty companies to sell this data, and if so, is this a main source of revenue?

Thanks in advance!

<p>A logical customer for your data would be existing market research firms.</p>

<p>Get in touch with some people working in these operations.  (Via networking, LinkedIn, cold contacts, whatever).  Chat with them to get a feel for how much your data is worth.  They can also tell you how they currently collect such data and who your competition is.</p>

<p>A starting point: check out the firms buying ads for the Google terms <a href="http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;q=%22market+research%22" rel="nofollow">"market research"</a>.  </p>
