My wife and I have been running a baby photography business for the last few years, but we've decided to close up shop.  I think one of the best assets we have is our logo/brand and domain name.  A fellow photographer suggested that we might be able to sell the brand.  The brand is generic enough that it could be used for any baby business, not just by another photographer.

Here are the items I think might be saleable:

 1. Our logo
 2. Our domain name
 3. Our website template

I have no idea how I would go about selling a brand like this.  Do any of you have any ideas for starting places on finding a marketplace for our brand?

<p>You could put it up in a place like <a href="http://www.brandbucket.com/" rel="nofollow">BrandBucket</a>. </p>

<p>What this site does is offering brand packages like the one you just mention: Name, logo, domain and sometimes web template. </p>

<p>I remember coming across some other similar ones, I'll see if I can find them. BrandBucket is probably the biggest one, though. </p>
