I am looking for recommendations on creating Twitter background image for a young software company. The goal is to have a Twitter profile page that projects  an image attractive to IT / software professionals.  

What is the best route to take: use websites that allow building it yourselves, or hire a professional designer?  Can you please share any outlets or guidelines / best practice for Twitter background that you know?

Thank you.

<p>Does the company have a logo? If so that would really help. You could pay a designer about $100 or less to just put the logo against a twitter-friendly background and that'd be the end of it. Or you can do it yourself, using free software like <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" rel="nofollow">Paint .NET</a>. </p>

<p>If the company doesn't have a logo, the cheapest (in my opinion) way to have someone design it for you is through <a href="http://99designs.com" rel="nofollow">99 Designs</a>. It's basically an online "marketplace" where you set a specific cash "prize", and designers will compete to win it by trying to create a logo that best matches your description. It ends up being far cheaper than having a professional do it (we paid $150 I think) and the logo is excellent quality. </p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>-Nick</p>

<p>A good resource for Twitter profiles is Joel Comm's book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470563362" rel="nofollow">Twitter Power</a>. You can see pieces of this online on his <a href="http://joelcomm.com/" rel="nofollow">web site</a> and it's also worth buying the book. </p>
