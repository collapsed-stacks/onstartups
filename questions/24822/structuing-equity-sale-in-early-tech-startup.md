I have a few Angel investors, and a meeting next week with serveral VCs (brought to the table by the primary Angel), and I am trying to put together the equity sale package to present to everyone (VCs and Angels).

The Angels have agreed to put money in (i.e-a % of the cash need), but no agreement has been set yet on how much equity it will buy them. Here are some details:

Product: Software Platform (Saas)
Cash Need: 1.4M

I have a business plan, and vetted proformas that show a very promising EBITDA.

Question: How much equity is each dollar given at this early stage worth? Or maybe a better question is: How much equity are the Angels likely to expect for each dollar given at this stage???

I have no more money to put in, a prototype has been built(wireframe), and to take it to market and code the platform, I will have to have the investment.

Thank you so much for your advice!

<p>From what I've seen, most  angel-round investors are going to want at least 20%-30% of your company so that they won't get diluted out later on. </p>

<p>Most pre-product startups are not going to get a valuation of over $2M, so if you <em>really</em> need $1.4M to pull it off, you're looking at selling around 70% of your company. That is going to make it very challenging to raise subsequent funding.</p>

<p>There is no right answer for "how much equity is each dollar give at this early stage worth?" It all depends...</p>

<p>In the beginning, most investors bet on people and not your product or idea. If you have amazing people, you might be able to get $41M round without even having launched yet (<a href="http://www.quora.com/Color-Labs-startup/As-a-VC-how-is-a-41-million-investment-in-Color-an-unproven-social-media-application-justified/answer/Yishan-Wong" rel="nofollow">Color.com</a> for example)</p>

<p>A company in Boston called <a href="http://www.smarterer.com" rel="nofollow">Smarterer</a> just raised <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2011/04/smarterer.html" rel="nofollow">$1.25M in funding</a> without a product or revenues, mainly because the CEO is the founder of venture backed <a href="http://www.bzzagent.com" rel="nofollow">BzzAgent</a>. </p>

<p>If it's possible for you to do it, the best way to maximum your valuation is to <strong>build a working product, and get some customers to pay you for it.</strong></p>
