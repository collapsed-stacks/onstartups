There was a site I found a while ago, where someone with an idea could post it (either a designer or a developer), and they could locate 'the other half' (i.e. a designer looking for a developer), and agree to split equity on partnering up to develop it.

It was a classic web 2.0-style site.

Unfortunately, I can't find the darn thing. Crawled Google all morning bashing in keywords like 'developers find designers +equity", etc and nothing spits back.

Any clue what I'm referring to?

<p>Two sites of this kind with good mindshare are <a href="http://fairsoftware.net" rel="nofollow">FairSoftware.net</a> and <a href="http://younoodle.com/" rel="nofollow">You Noodle</a>.</p>
