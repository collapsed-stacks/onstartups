How can the co-founders that hold a minority of the shares be protected against:

 - A dilution of his equity (economic and control) triggered by the shareholders that hold a majority of the shares?
 - A dilution of his equity due to an agreement of non-diluting equity with a shareholder?
 - A dilution of his control by the means of M&A by other company owned by the shareholders that hold a majority of the shares?

<p>The way to protect minority (or any) stockholders against dilution is with a written non-dilution agreement.</p>

<p>Basically such an agreement could state:</p>

<p>1) Existing stockholders have a right of first refusal to purchase any additional shares being offered by the company.</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>2) A prohibition on the issuance of new shares without the prior consent of a super majority (2/3, 3/4 or whatever) of the existing shareholders.</p>

<p>You should be aware that such an agreement, while serving your desires, may or may not be good for the company. In general they are frowned upon.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has a nice article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_dilution" rel="nofollow">stock dilution</a>, which can take many forms.</p>
