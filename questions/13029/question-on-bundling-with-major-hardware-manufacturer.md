I have been approached by a Global Hardware Manufacturer wanting to "partner" with my company and bundle my software with their products. My questions:

1.) If I need to make changes to the software to accommodate their requirement, I would like to charge time and materials. Does this sound reasonable?

2.) Licensing: I absolutely want some form of per seat charge for each unit shipped with their product. Does this sound reasonable, and what price discount should I charge off the retail?

3.) Exclusive licensing: They have not mentioned this, but it could get to this. I want to avoid signing any exclusive licensing within the industry they operated. Does this sound reasonable?

4.) At what point should I seek the advice of an attorney.

Background: We have signed a mutual nda, had numerous meetings, ect...

A **major** portion of our income comes from OEM licensing.

1) We **always** separate licensing from custom work. You have licensing fees and you have separate fees for custom software modifications. There is no way you can predict what (or if) a given customer wants modified. You charge them separately for this service.

2) You need to "feel" your client out on this part of the deal. Some customers are happy to pay a fee per seat and others want a fixed price deal *(which you can limit by time.)*

3) **Do not do exclusive** licenses. See 4) below.

4) You need to have **your own, non-exclusive** license agreement, which means you need a a lawyer (one who specializes in IP) before you start to negotiate. You should send the OEM your **non-exclusive** license agreement. You do not want to work from theirs.

5) Who provides support?? This is critical! In most OEM deals the OEM provides support. You do not want to be burdened with support for something you are not selling yourself.

6) Pricing- pricing in OEM deals has virtually nothing to do with your **retail** price. Throw away all thoughts of your retail price. Your job is to gather enough information from the OEM to set a reasonable price **for that OEM**. Is your product **required** to make his hardware work?? If so, you can get a higher price per seat.  Does your software greatly increase the value of his hardware- if so you get more money. Is your software non-essential to his hardware?? Can he easily sell the hardware without your software?? If so, your software commands minimal value.

Typical OEM deals range from $0.10 to a few dollars per piece.

7) **Make sure to get a non-refundable advance on the first quarter or first years royalties!!** This is often the only money you will ever see.

8) In our experience only 1 in 10 (or so) of these deals ever ends up being signed.
