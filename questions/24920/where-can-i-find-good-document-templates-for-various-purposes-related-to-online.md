rocketlawyer.com a lot of stuff like that for free (you just have to dig a little) and echosign.com has a few of those things also. I would highly recommend Rocket Lawyer.

Here is an employment one: http://www.rocketlawyer.com/employment_agreement-form.aspx

<p><a href="http://www.docstoc.com" rel="nofollow">Docstoc</a> has a number of template documents available that you can buy or get a description for.  They aren't free, but they are written by professionals as opposed to a side project.</p>

<p>You can see them at <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/store/legal-forms" rel="nofollow">http://www.docstoc.com/store/legal-forms</a></p>
