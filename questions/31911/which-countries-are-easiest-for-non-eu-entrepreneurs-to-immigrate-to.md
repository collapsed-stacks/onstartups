I'm a non-EU entrepreneur running a startup in EU. I'm looking for a country where I can immigrate to as self-employed. Which countries have favorable rules? Short application processing times, not heavy capital investments, etc.

Thank you

Check the world bank and inf 'doing business' index;

"Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1 â€“ 183. A high ranking on the ease of doing business index means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm. This index averages the country's percentile rankings on 10 topics, made up of a variety of indicators, giving equal weight to each topic. The rankings for all economies are benchmarked to June 2011."
