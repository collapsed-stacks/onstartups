I have a line of products which I will be marketing to retail establishments. Some of the products will contain quotes or sayings. How much royalty should I offer to the author. Or are there other suggestions?

You don't have to pay royalties on quotes.  If you did, Yogi Berra would be a rich man and he's not.  Or at least he's not rich from his quotation royalties.

Technically you have to put the quote in quotations and give credit to the author.

It all varies by how aggressive each side is in the negotiations- I'd offer just a tiny percentage of the net sales price, which excludes returns, samples, etc.
