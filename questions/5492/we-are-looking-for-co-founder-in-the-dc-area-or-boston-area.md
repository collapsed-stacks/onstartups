Iâ€™m looking for a Front end developer to join a seed funded startup in the DC or Boston area.

The project is a Database search service, a powerful combination of search technology with BI (business intelligence) and Data warehousing.

The ideal candidate must be highly motivated with a startup spirit. Knowledge of languages C, C++, C# or python in necessary; Scripting languages and client technologies JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, XML, XHTML are equally required. Databases and BI knowledge are not mandatory.
If interested please shout me an email: okeumeni at hotmail.com
