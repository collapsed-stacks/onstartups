I am a college student and I am supposed to be creating a business plan for a school project. I decided to create a faux video game company in order to satisfy the criteria of the project, but I've run into a snag: what catagory of business does a company that creates video games fall under? Manufacturing was my guess, but I want something more concrete than a guess.

Of the four you mentioned - manufacturing, retail, wholesale, or service - the software development side of video game production is a service because the ultimate goods being produced and consumed are virtual. More specifically, such a business is providing an entertainment service.

Ubisoft, for example, has NAICS code 541511, which stands for Custom Computer Programming Services. Activision and Electronic Arts both use NAICS code 511210, which stands for Software Publishers.

Why it's not manufacturing or retail/wholesale: The absence of tangible goods. There may be  manufacturing/retail/wholesale components to a video game business, but these roles are typically contracted out to a different company. Manufacturing would involve the production of the discs or cartridges the games are sold on. If it were retail or wholesale, then the business would be responsible for selling the games in a store either directly to consumers or to another reseller.

I would use one of the business categories established by [NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAICS). This is what the IRS uses to categorize businesses.

Here is a complete [list of all the categories](http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1065/ar03.html).

I would go with Software Publishers (code 511210) under the [Information industry](http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1065/ar03.html#d0e8692).

Video games are software development... Entertainment software development for a more specific area I suppose but in general it is just software development.
