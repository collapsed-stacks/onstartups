I was the original registrant and owner of the domain name my (former) company website. The company never "acquired" nor did I assign it to the company. The company is now threatening that I should hand over the domain name or else...

Since no assignment was made, am I right in assuming that the domain name belongs to me? or do they have a case?

<p>Your answer can't be found here; you will need to review all contracts and informal agreements (emails, meeting notes, etc) that you have made.</p>

<p>It would be normal for a partnership agreement, employment contract, consulting agreement or similar to contain a catch-all intellectual property (IP) transfer clause. If you signed an IP transfer, then read it carefully. See the <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/19422/if-im-working-at-a-company-do-they-have-intellectual-property-rights-to-the-st/20136#20136">canonical intro to IP transfer clauses</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you did not sign an IP transfer, the domain might still belong to your former employer. Just the fact that you were employed brings with it duties -- but which ones and their extent depends on the country.</p>

<p>So, review the agreements you have made, and the laws in your area. And then go see a qualified lawyer.</p>

<p>I personally agree with @Steve Jones -- this isn't worth fighting over.</p>
