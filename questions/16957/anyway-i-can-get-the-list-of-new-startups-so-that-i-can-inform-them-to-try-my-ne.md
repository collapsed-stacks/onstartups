I have just launched my first startup regarding A/B test creation and monitoring service for anyone who want to increase their website conversion rate through A/B tests.

Is there a way I can find the list of startups or web developers contacts so I can inform them regarding this service?


** Thank you Virtuosi Media and Jesper for your comprehensive guide! I will definitely follow your advise.

<p>There are thousands of web design blogs to try. Start following some links on Twitter for topics related to web design and you'll be able to build a list very quickly between the people tweeting and the blogs they link to in their tweets. You can also use CSS and website galleries to build up a list as designers will often post their work to showcase it.</p>

<p>A few other ideas to promote yourself in the community:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start a blog about the importance of
A/B testing.</li>
<li>Demonstrate your product through
videos and blog posts and show how
easy it is to use.</li>
<li>Guest post on other blogs. Target bigger ones to make most efficient use of your time.</li>
<li>Make it easy for developers to
integrate.</li>
<li>Make extensions for major CMS's.</li>
<li>Advertise on web design blogs (check
<a href="http://buysellads.com/" rel="nofollow">BuySellAds</a>) or through AdWords.</li>
<li>Find contests and contribute your
service as one of the prizes.</li>
<li>Hold a contest.</li>
<li>Create an affiliate system using
<a href="http://zferral.com/" rel="nofollow">Zferral</a> or <a href="http://www.hasoffers.com/" rel="nofollow">HasOffers</a>.</li>
<li>Write a white paper on how to conduct
A/B testing. Use your product as a way to teach.</li>
<li>Have real-life case studies of websites that have used your service on your website. Nothing is better than testimonials.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a word of warning, I'd be careful about just emailing people out of the blue as some might take it as spam. Get your name out there in the community a bit first. I would try everything on the above list first.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, you're asking for <strong>a list of <em>all</em> startups around the world who are building webapps right now?</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is no such list, at least not a comprehensive one.</strong> But you can probably get close by compiling data from several of the startup community's favourite news aggregators. Take a look at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com" rel="nofollow">Crunchbase</a></li>
<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/" rel="nofollow">Techcrunch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/" rel="nofollow">ReadWriteWeb</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mashable.com/" rel="nofollow">Mashable</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gigaom.com/" rel="nofollow">GigaOM</a></li>
<li>Also be sure to take a look at this thread at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1375898" rel="nofollow">Hacker News about startup news</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With good data mining of the above sources you should be able to create a near-complete list of startups -- at least of the startups that are publicizing / interacting with the community.</p>

<p>A final note: If you actually go ahead and compile such a list, you should really share it. It would be absolutely fantastic link-bait, i.e. it would be a great blog post that would attract lots of attention.</p>

Aside from what Jesper said, have you actually **thought** about your question???

You want to **limit** the marketing of your service to a very small subset of all the people you could sell to. Why is that??? Can't **any** web site use your service?

If I come up with a new service that helps get goods from trucks onto store shelves, do I say I only want to market it to Ice Cream Stores??
