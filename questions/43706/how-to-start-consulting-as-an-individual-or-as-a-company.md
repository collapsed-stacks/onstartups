I am planning to offer SEO and Web Development services(mainly SEO). It's a case of Bootstrapping. So my confusion is, if I create a website to offer services..

Should I present my website as a brand or company

or

Should I present it as a site about myself(as a portfolio) and offer services there as a consultant.

And (in context of second question) is it good to start with Blogger or with my own domain.

Your own name can be a brand itself. Personally I'd like to know with whom I am dealing. If I see a freelancer without registered company acting like a company, I am confused. If it is a registered company I would like to see this guy acting as one.

Therefore I would go with that: do you register a company? Act like one. I expect you do employee some people soon.
Do you work a freelancer? Make a portfolio site. I don't expect you to employ people. If you do at any time, you can found a company.

In terms of domain: use your own. And use your own web host. I never cooperated with SEO/Dev people who were not able to host their own stuff and/or own their own domain. I mean - web devs using Blogspot? Sounds pretty cheap to me.

of course you must have your domain and a good site as a seo.

You should also have some sites in the SERPS.

Many companies ask for references.

If you don't have references in SEO business a good starting point is to have contracts on a provision basis.
