I learned quite a bit of relevant information in reading David Meerman Scott's excellent book, ["The New Rules of Marketing and PR"][1]

I'm looking for similar focused, tactical, and useful resources to help in developing and executing the marketing and launch strategies for a new user generated content web site.

What are your suggestions? 

Thanks.

You might want to look at "The Whuffie Factor" by Tara Hunt. Somewhat generic but good food for thought on how to go about utilizing social media for your business.

<p>I find myself not having much time to read the traditional books... so I resort a lot to online information (which also tends to be more updated, since it covers what's happening THIS minute).</p>

<p>A great place to go get ideas and learn is <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/" rel="nofollow">Marketing Profs</a>. They have a ton of stuff about inbound marketing, PR, social media, lead generation... </p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
