My company provides a SaaS combined with specialized hardware (video surveillance package) for industrial clients.

We do not sell the hardware, we only lease the hardware (which also covers the cost of a base SaaS package)

If we wanted to increase our sales channels, is there a typical model for "re-leasers"?

There's plenty of solutions/integration companies out there who would probably make good resellers, but, they're probably going to want the hardware business for themselves.

I'm in a similar situation, and don't want to be in the hardware business, so this would be a win for me.
