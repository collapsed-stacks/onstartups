I have startup software company (SaaS model) that is just me. All funding comes in from my main customer(Customer A). Product still in development and I have specific roadmap for next versions.

At the same time I sold subscription to Customer B. Customer knew what he is buying and  happy with the service(features and price). Contract signed, they are using it and all is well.

What I get now is regular (~ 2 times a week) emails from Customer B asking if some certain feature can be added. With first couple I said it is on road map (it's true) but now I'm getting questions about stuff that will be there but in 1-2 years maybe.

I understand where customer comes from (doesn't hurt to ask) but I'm not sure what to answer to this kind of questions. If customer paid for development - I might include it, but even in that case I'd rather not do this stuff. So, I wonder what is correct way to say that:

 - No, we not including features you asking about any time soon 
 - Right now we busy with doing work that we getting paid for (separately from service) 
 - We might do what you ask about sooner if you "sponsor" this development

P.S. I'm very green in all customer care and sales aspects. Customer B is my first actual product/service SALE. Customer A is my customer for 12 years.

You basically have the answer in your question (though I would leave out your second statement):

> We are currently working on several features to improve your experience with Product X. 
> 
> At this point in time, we do not have plans to add Feature Y to our product. As per our contract, if you would like to pay for the development costs of building this feature, we can arrange to have it built over the course of the next 3 months. The cost would be approximately $1,000, depending on the exact details of the feature.

I think you should set up a feature request forum that they can post ideas on.  There are quite a few services that can help with this, eg...

 - http://www.uservoice.com/
 - http://www.zendesk.com/

This way you aren't obligated to respond to every one.  They can just know they have thrown the idea into the hat to be considered.

Also, it's tempting to say "yes" too often, but you can't let it deviate you from the vision of your product.  You will be thankfully later when you have said "no" to things that you don't want in there.  They also wouldn't be expecting you to agree to every suggestion.
