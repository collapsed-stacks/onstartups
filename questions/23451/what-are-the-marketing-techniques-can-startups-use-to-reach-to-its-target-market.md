We are a service startup and we work with hotels and restaurants helping them create their online presence like their site/blog or presence and spread in social media platforms.

Though some of our clients are tech-savvy and regularly keep them updated with blog and other social sites like linkedin groups, twitter and facebook. But a big chunk of our target customers are not that tech-savvy.

Now we want to reach out to both these segment, so I guess we need to use online and  offline technique as well to reach out to them.

Considering we are a young startup it will be great if you can suggest some online and offline marketing techniques that you might have previously employed in your business and have found helpful to reach out to your target audience effectively.

Thank You  for your time to read and respond to our query!

Local and regional tourism and hospitality groups often maintain membership lists.  From the membership lists, you might be able to gain at least cursory indication as to whether the firm in question is active, and lo-fi.  Such indicators might be a lack of domain name in email address that reflects the name of their firm, or an explicit lack of indication for a website about the firm.

Convention and event centers may also be a place to get in contact with someone who is aware of local hotel, motel, and B&Bs who use their facilities, that often get good reviews by corresponding patrons, but have otherwise low exposure (hidden gems that maybe shouldn't be).

Another possibility would be to partner with more traditional local marketers to provide your service either on a referral basis, or as a somewhat vested partner for your particular market of interest.  Radio, especially, could be a good candidate because they are somewhat complementary to attracting your target market, whereas TV and newspaper might be a bit more competative (as their core business is not in what the web provides, visual and semi-print).

- Have you ever made a search on Facebook for Hotels and Restaurants?
- Get the Yellow Pages and send out a mailing to your target prospects.
- Review your regional newspapers about your target prospects and call or write them.
- Place a small ad in your regional newspaper or magazines, so that your target prospects are curious about to know something off your Service.

Keep an eye on your advertising and mailing costs and on ROI. Hope this helps.
