I'm just getting started with promoting my startup in Google+, and am looking for suggestions on the best way to do this.

I can post to Google+ as (1) the "page" for the startup or as (2) my email address at the startup.  To make my life a little simpler, I'd like to choose one or other, and it is hard to choose since each option seems to have some benefits.

Posting as a page seems better since people can +1 my page in addition to +1'ing any posts, and I suspect that having a page with a lot of +1's is good for SEO.

On the other hand, it is much easier to connect with people under my email address since I can +1 them from my gmail page (using Google apps for email) and it is also a bit more personal.  I currently have more connections this way than from the page.

Any feedback for choosing one of these two options or more generally for promoting a startup on Google+ would be appreciated.

Promote it as a page.  It's what google is intending, so it's what they will be adding features for to facilitate it.  Facebook has done well with their business pages and you can only suspect Google will follow on the same.

If you do it as yourself, you are going against the intention, I am sure that will bite you at some point.

I agree with Joel, make it a page. Use your email to make your personal account on G+. Connect with people you know via your personal account. And then share the business page on your personal stream to encourage people to circle your startup.

Keep in mind that pages have some limits. You can't manage them from the mobile interface. You can't circle people unless they circle your page first. And when you're browsing, your shares will default to your personal account.
