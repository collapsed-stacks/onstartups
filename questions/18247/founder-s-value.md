I'm the founder of a start-up that I later incorporated as a 501c3.  I continued as Exec Director working with a Board of my choosing.  After 11 years, I'm thinking of retiring and creating a FT Employee position for Ex Director.  I have been a contract worker for these 11 years but will be an employee for the next year before moving on.  How do I determine the value of my contribution?  J. Paul

Your contribution in monetary terms is determined loosely by the salaries of other people in your position, with right/responsibilities similar to yours governing other 501(c)3s that are similar in size (by revenue or number of FT employees).

This valuation is specific to non-profits.  If it were a for-profit company, you could value your contribution at whatever you'd like as long as you had shareholder approval and didn't violate your "Duty of Loyalty and Care" as outlined by the Division of Corp laws in your state.

If your valuation is to set this year's salary, then you have a lot of flexibility.  If it's to pay yourself retroactively, be warned that non-profit accounting must keep a running ledge of a debt owed in order to justify retroactive compensation.
