Gaining a monopoly is of course something that is interesting for all entrepreneurs, is it still possible to make one? If so, how?

A monopoly can be achieved the following ways:

 - Getting perfect patent coverage
 - Owning land will sometimes create a local monopoly. For example a skicenter
 - Being dominant in an area of business where network effect is strong and there are barriers to changing. (I thought about Facebook until Google+ came along. I do not have other good examples). 
 - Having an exclusive sales deal with a monopolistic producer
 - Being the only provider who has been approved by an approval agency or government

Of course, as with all monopolies, if one exploits the position too much, competition will come.
