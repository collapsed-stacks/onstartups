<p>The classic <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/" rel="nofollow">famfam</a> icons are a great place to start. These are widely used and definitely not stolen. I'm not sure if this set of icons really fit your needs but there is a pretty wide range of them.</p>

Are you sure you want to build a **business** web site with "free" icons? How do you know the free icons weren't stolen? If they were stolen you will be the one who gets into legal trouble when your site becomes popular and the stolen icons are recognized.

You are far better off **buying** the right to use icons on your web site.
