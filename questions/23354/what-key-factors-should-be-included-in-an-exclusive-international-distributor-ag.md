If I was doing what these items would be on my check list: 

 - Performance measures.
 - A ramp up to exclusivity based on performance
 - An option to drop exclusivity under specific situations
 - Scaled compensation
 - Clear delineation of customer service responsibilities
 - Clear definitions of customer ownership
 - Reporting Requirements
 - Marketing/Branding requirements
 - An exit strategy.

Great question. I look forward to seeing others responses.
