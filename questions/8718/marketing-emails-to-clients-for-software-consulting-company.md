Do you have a list of prospects already in place?  Email marketing is more like spam if you don't have a list where prospects have opted in.  Until you get a list, I recommend trying to partner with someone else to pitch their opt-in list, or trying something other than email.  What you should try depends on what kind of IT Consulting you are doing and who is your target audience.

No, figuring out the pricing sweet spot is a bit more complicated.  I generally like to think of pricing in terms of value.  What kind of ROI will the customer get from my services?  Also, how do you want to be positioned against the competition?  Are you leading with price, quality, or some combination thereof?  If you can find out what your more established competition is charging, that is a good gage to start with.  If you feel you need to reduce your price and you don't want to be see as the Walmart of your field, offer coupons or some other discount incentive rather than list your price lower.  Why?  Because then you take the price issue off the table without looking like a "cheap" service.

Anyway, I have a ton more on each of these subjects (I'm a marketing consultant), but this should get you thinking in the right direction.
