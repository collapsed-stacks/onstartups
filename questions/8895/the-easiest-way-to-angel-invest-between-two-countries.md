Is there a quick and easy way for a person based in Europe to invest in a startup (incorporated) in Asia?

<p>Maybe Jarie or some of the other people more experienced in venture capital deals will chime in...</p>

<p>For now just 2 quick thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It <strong>really</strong> depends on which Asian country we're talking about. Some of them have excellent and transparent legal systems, others ... not so much. Your chances of enforcing the deal vary greatly with the country...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you're certain that there will be institutional investment later on (A-round), then</strong> maybe a convertible bridge loan could be the way to go... I'm not categorically saying so, but I could see a convertible loan require less legal work (have lower transaction fees). That's good for an angel investment round, you do not want the legal fees to be 'large' relative to the investment sum. See this post for a <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2006/02/whats-the-best-structure-for-a-pre-vc-investment.html" rel="nofollow">quick definition</a>. NB: The requirement for an A-Round is in itself problematic IMHO; most Asian countries have smaller venture capital communities, and hence getting to an A-round is something that I'd consider difficult to achieve.</p></li>
</ul>

There is no "quick and easy way" in any investment. You should have deep knowledge in area (economical and geographical) you invest. Knowledge in local laws concerning the investments etc. As Joel mentioned, it depends on the countries, so be more specific.
