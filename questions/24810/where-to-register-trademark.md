I have a site that is really starting to take off and I've noticed people are starting to use the name in ways I don't like. Basically harming the brand..

I want to trademark the name, but have a few questions..

Do I have to register the trademark in every country? Is there an 'international trademark' I can register somewhere..?

The site is used worldwide..

<p>Generally trademark have to be registered separately for each country AFAIK. For US have a look at <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.uspto.gov/</a></p>

<p>For EU:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trade marks may be registered within individual countries, or across the whole of the EU (by means of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Trade_Mark" rel="nofollow">Community Trade Mark</a>).</p>

<p>No there is not an international trademark and if you want a registered trademark you must register in each country.</p>

<p>Note that in the US and some other countries you have a trademark merely by using the mark in commerce.  You thus already have a trademark.  What you are looking to get now is a <strong>registered</strong> trademark, which has some benefits over an unregistered (i.e. common law) trademark. See <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/register.jsp" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the benefits of registering in the U.S. </p>

<p>Some countries (e.g., in Europe) don't have common law trademark rights, and if you want trademark rights you must register.</p>

<p>If you were the first to use your mark and others are copying you in the U.S., you can send out a cease and desist letter right away.  You don't need to wait until you get your registration, which might take six months.</p>
