www.Compete.com
www.Alexa.com

Are there other valuable sources I am missing? I would like to avoid a 499/month subscription to see data about the sites referring traffic to a specific URL, however I realize I'm searching for very specific and valuable data. 

If you have any suggestions for ways to find this sort of information please share, I am certain just about every online company would find this information extremely valuable. 

Thank you!

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.semrush.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.semrush.com/</a> can give you some insight on competitor traffic, ads on Google and other.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/</a>   a SeoMoz tool. You can ask more <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/users/105/randfish">Rand Fishkin</a> about it.</li>

<p>Not very fancy, but you can use the <strong>link:</strong> directive with Google searches.</p>

<p>So the query <a href="http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;q=link%3afoo.com" rel="nofollow">link:foo.com</a> shows you sites that reference foo.com.  Doesn't tell you anything about the quantity of the traffic going through the links of course.</p>
