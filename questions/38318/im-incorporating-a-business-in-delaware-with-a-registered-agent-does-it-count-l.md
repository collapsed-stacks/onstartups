Do I get treated the same like any other corp in Delaware? I want to make sure I don't get charged by the state more fees because I'm not from there. 

What's the catch as far as taxes and state fees doing it this way?

If by "catch" you mean state taxes, your company will still have to pay state taxes in the state it actually does business in, regardless of where you incorporate the business entity. So if you incorporate in Delaware but set up shop in California, you will still have to register the Delaware corporation in California and pay California taxes. Online businesses might have some leeway, but state taxes can be triggered by other factors like the locations of employees, offices, and bank accounts.
