My pre-seed technology startup has developed unique IP which needs protection. The industry we're targeting is run by giants (with tons of IP), so the IP story will play a key-role on the startup. This being the case, we decided that it'd be a good idea to bring in a Patent Lawyer as an advisor. This would help with strategy, fees, along with increasing the value as we prepare for funding.

Any ideas on how I'd go about finding interested parties?

<p>In my opinion, you should plan to retain an IP lawyer as a legal advisor, i.e., pay him or her an hourly fee to provide legal guidance. Good IP lawyers are sufficiently busy that few are likely to want to accept a reduced fee, or alternative compensation, for the privilege of providing both legal advice and business advice.</p>
