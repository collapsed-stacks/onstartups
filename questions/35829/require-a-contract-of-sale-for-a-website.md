Legal Zoom may help. If the web application is already made or completed you just need something like - "This website is being sold BY, TO and is provided 'as is' - the seller provides no warranty or accepts any liability for the web application after the sale."

If it's already bought you could probably use a legal document for selling a car ;) - just something that says you except $X for it and assume 0 responsibility for it after the sale.
