There is a product A that is developed by X-Corpoation and is provided as both Community Edition and Commercial Edition. Community Edition is licensed under GPL v1.

A Y-Corporation, my startup, wants to build a product B that is based on the community edition of the product A and wants to also be able to provide a free (community edition) of the product B, as well as the paid versions of the product, just like X-Corporation does.

Can Y-Corporation legally do this?

Additional info:

Product A's source code is taken as a code base and 70% of new features are to be added - this is what product B is panned to be. New name and logo is also a must for product B.

Product A's owner just says they are using GPL v2.

P.S. This is an essential question for my start-up, and can't just be separated and called "legal-only question". Please consider this point before deciding to vote down. Thanks.

You can do this as long as you comply with the requirements of the GPL.

What this means is that you must make the full source code of project B available under the GPL license for both the community and paid versions.  This severely limits your ability to sell a paid version of B since your customers can freely redistribute to others.

The best solution is to contact Company X and ask for a license from them that allows you to do what you want to do.
