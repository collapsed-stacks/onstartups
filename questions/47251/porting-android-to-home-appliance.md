I have a startup and we are planning to port the android OS to home appliances.  Our system comprises of an android-loaded device, touch console and interfacing circuits. This would allow the user to control the hardware. 

I want to know if I have to take care of any licensing or copyright issues, or get some sort of consent from Google. If onstartups is not the right place to ask this question. Please point me to where I can get a solution / who can give apt advice.

Thanks

<p>There is a difference between Android and Google Android - suggest you read <a href="http://www.e-consystems.com/blog/android/?p=457" rel="nofollow">this article</a> to learn the differences and how it affects licensing. </p>

<p>In short, Android is GPL2 and Apache licensed, but if you want to include the google apps (mail, play, youtube, maps, etc) one needs to discuss the licensing of the Google services and pass the Compatibility Test Suite to gain access.</p>
