I have developed advanced CMS software with integrated ecommerce system for running large eshops and managing content on multiple websites. It has some really modern features it's all AJAX, desktop-like environment, flexible content editing, very robust eshop administration, etc... Technically speaking it has some state-of-the-art features. 

Now I am based in the Czech Republic and I would like to start selling at the global market. The competion of all the CMS systems is so high, so I am asking for answer to this question:

How would you start selling "yet-another-CMS-system" regarding it has tens of features that even the best competitors don't have implemented ?



Due to high competition it is highly unlikeable to use SEO optimalization and get to SERPs any near to the first page. I am thinking about using AdWords at first, but I still thinks that for this product it will be just waste of money. Can you suggest me some ideas what would work best for marketing/selling my CMS on the global market ?

My recommendation would be to select a few respected web developers in the areas you want to target.  Send each of them a brief email message explaining the system and offer them the opportunity to be a referring partner.

AdWords would be a good start, but don't forget Yahoo & Bing paid advertising either (MSN AdCenter) - cheaper traffic and higher conversions, but less volume.

Having a good affiliate program in place with a compelling offer for your affiliates (if you really want to grow, you could try something like 100% commission for the first month, if for example it was a recurring product) - a lot of people overlook the power of a strong affiliate program. Check what your competitors affiliate programs offer and do something much bigger in the beginning. Google around for people promoting your competitors (a quick search for the product name will do, dig around the top 10 pages for affiliates, i.e people promoting the software) and then try and contact them about your own affiliate program which offers better payouts. You can always lower the payouts once you've established yourself.

Out of interest, is the software live? I'm actually looking for some good eCommerce/CMS software right now. ;)
