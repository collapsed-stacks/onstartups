Similar to this question: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/10324/amount-of-vesting-equity-for-3-4-employee

But it seems to discuss what equity *paid* developers should expect.  If I am a developer that is unpaid, what would be a reasonable percentage of the stock to expect for doing software development?  What would be a reasonable vesting period?

<p><strong>IMHO if you're unpaid, then you are a founder.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If there are 2 co-founders, then 50%/50% of the pre-investment shares, with a 2-5 year vesting period.</li>
<li>If there are 3 co-founders, then 1/3 - 1/3 - 1/3 of the pre-investment shares, with a 2-5 year vesting period.</li>
</ul>

I think you should really consider reading this: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6949/forming-a-new-software-startup-how-do-i-allocate-ownership-fairly/23326#23326

His point is that people get paid for their work. If the person doing the work is not getting paid in cash (i.e., no salary) then they get paid in an IOU (i.e., debt). To try to balance out who is working harder and, thus deserves more equity, is a way to create resentment and will, eventually, destroy an otherwise solid business.
