So you are about to start contacting companies about licensing your product/technology. What would be the general elements of the presentation deck? I know what I've done in the past but am wondering about any better approaches. 

And related, a big part of my approach has been to focus on tangle value - savings, new revenue, new customers gained...by using the product/technology. Especially in this current economy. But how do you address that when the product would be used in a brand new way with no data yet available and you really have no idea other than wild guesstimates?

Appreciate it,

Companies that license products and technology typically want to buy instead of build because they figure it's cheaper to do so. Therefore, any pitch needs to address the Unique Value Position that you product or technology will bring. It would seem to me that you need to hit the following topics:

 - Who you are?
 - What the technology/product is?
 - It's Unique Value Position (UVP) in the market
 - Your Customer traction
 - Other licensing deals that you have done
 - General Deal Framework
 - Proposed next steps and evaluation plans
