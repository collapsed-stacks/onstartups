Our company is registered in Delaware with an office in New York State. We have acquired several code-signing certificates for the past 5 years, and the name of the company we requested to be "on certificate" was our actual registered name. For example SuperCompany.com, Inc.

Now we need to register a certificate with an alias name, like AnotherCompany, Inc. A code-signing certificate process involves sending company tax data, etc. Will a registrar (in our case Comodo) allow registering a certificate on a different company name? Has anyone done something similar?  

Disclimer to "How does it relate to startup":

A alias name if for the company that is not yet registered, but will be in future, if the project is successful. So it is basically "how to get a code-signing certificate to a not-yet-legally-registered startup with "parent" companies documents".

Back when we were starting we asked the same question. The answer is no. You'll have to get a DBA (Doing Business As) or form a proper company (LLC, S-Corp, etc.) in the name you want. Then, and only then, can you get the code signing cert in the name you want.
