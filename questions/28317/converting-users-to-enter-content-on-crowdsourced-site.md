I've been running a crowd sourced quiz site for a while:

http://www.quizmash.com

While I'm getting plenty of quizzes taken through google search traffic, my conversion rate to entering a question is pretty bad.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can improve this.

I think your navigation, layout and terminology is confusing users. I think you need to make the following improvements:

- make the front page and main navigation focused around the three main reasons visitors are there (Start a quiz, add questions, see leaderboards), I suspect the general user doesnt care about your twitter link, searching for questions, about, help (move those all to a sub navigation somewhere else). The front page could be split in two, one side to answer and the other side to add questions
- remove the add questions interface from the answer screens as again it is confusing (see aside below)
- I think the term "mashed" is a bit confusing when you mean "created"
