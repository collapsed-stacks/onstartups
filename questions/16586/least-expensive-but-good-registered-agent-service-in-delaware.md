Have you guys heard of freeregisteredagent.com? They offer free registered agent service for first year, and $99 thereafter. Is that for real? Is it a scam? Has anyone used them before?

<p>I've used Delaware Business Services, Inc. for a few years and have no complaints. They are just $50/yr and are very good at reminding you to pay DE Taxes. Check them out.</p>

We have used Corporate Filing Solutions LLC (www.filingsmadeeasy.com) in multiple states.  They provide fantastic service and their rates are significantly less than the larger national services.
