I am working in a banking sector as a software developer and I am in the early stages of founding a Startup. My Startup is no way near/similar related to banking market...

As far as software/development goes, I am outsourcing it to another country.So, technically, I am not using the software provided by current company. 

I was wondering that if my company where I am currently employed, can sue me or take over the credibility of my startup in the future? What risks/calculations do I need to measure before I say **QUIT** to my recent company?

**PS:** I looked into the offer letter agreement (it didn't mention anything similar).
