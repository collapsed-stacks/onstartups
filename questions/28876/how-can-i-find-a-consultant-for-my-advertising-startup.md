I have a an idea for a startup that would be closely intertwined with the Advertising industry.  I still need to do the necessary research to determine if the idea is viable and to identify all the major hurdles I'll be running into at some point.  For this, I need the help of a consultant that understands the business end of the commercial advertising industry and I have no idea where to start looking for one.

Thanks in advance for all your wisdom!

I've no idea what your questions are, but I know lots of people who work in advertising, because my business revolves around advertising.

If I can help, I'd need to know what budget you might have for a consultant, and the types of questions you have.

You can see a little about my business Wordfruit Copywriters.

How about the following?

 - LinkedIn.
 - AdWeek (a famous advertising magazine)
 - Marketing Today (another famous magazine specialized in marketing and advertising)

This is a bit more risky, but you could go to your local college or business school and hire a young, bright and motivated grad student (or recent grad).
