I'm looking for a web app with CRM, ERP and simple accounting features to run a small software shop.  

Will be very grateful if someone could help me out with this.

One option to consider is Microsoft Dynamics ERP Software-as-a-Service.  You’ll get core accounting features and Dynamics AX and Dynamics NAV have some CRM features built in.  MS Partners will host and maintain the solution for you and you’ll pay a monthly per user fee.  This link will give you more details:  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/erp-cloud.aspx

If you are small then your needs may be very specific, and your budget very limited.  I always suggest building your own CRM to track customers the way it makes sense for your business.  Its development time well spent.

You can try building it yourself using tools like Ragic Builder. All you need to do is create a form to fill out on its web spreadsheet interface, so you have complete control over what's in your CRM. Plus there's no coding necessary.
