I have several side projects that I am considering working on. Some are for non-profits while others could lead to a new gig. I was wondering some of the criteria that everyone uses to select or prune a side project.

For me it is:

- Personal gratification (eg: a new technology, it's fun, joy of helping someone else)
- Potential profit

You could make it more complicated but, I think this is simple enough. If it's not enjoyable you will probably stop doing it.  Ideally there is some money to be made in it, or at least that can be used a sorting order. If both are fun, pick the one with the most cash or sale potential.

I wish I wouldn't get distracted with side projects but I do.  I can't help it and now I embrace it, but, like you, i want to get better at setting aside time and limiting them to only a few so they can actually be beneficial.

For me:

- If I am solving a friend's problem and it looks like it is limited in duration, and I have some small interest, I will work on it.  These are easy because they are usually only small projects

- Is this something that really interests me?  If there is sufficient interest and passion I run with it, but only for some short time.  I then decide if there is a way to turn it into a business or apply it to another business.  

- Since about a year ago - I have generally just started trying to play matchmaker rather than be directly involved.  I volunteer to do some work and asked to be updated or be a beta tester - but knowing that I am already overworked I try to put together a few of the parties I think would make good matches to get something done.  


There have been no amazing successes so far.  (well, not financially.  Technically almost all have been successful - and that is the old cliche/story... no paths beaten to these doors just yet)

Is the project going to aid in the realization of your long term objectives?   

My criteria is relevance.  Does this project have any relevance to achieving my single biggest goal; is it helping me gain relevant skills, experience or contacts? 

If not: ditch it.  If it is: embrace and continue the ascent towards your desired destination.

Is it necessary to have a side project? Is it possible to find a main project so exciting and with so much potential that there is little reason to work on a second project? My advice is to prune all side projects and to focus entirely on a project that you absolutely love.
