I'm Irish and I'm in the process of registering my business which is an online store selling products which is currently being manufactured. I won't need a warehouse to store the products as I will be starting small so I can start in my own home, and I save on renting offices etc. However I plan to move to the UK as I want to settle there for good. Is it possible to move a sole trader or limited online company from Ireland to the UK? Is it an easy or an arduous task? Should I relocate now before starting the business in Ireland?

Thanks in advance for the help!!!
