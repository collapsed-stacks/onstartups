I have a startup, active for 2 years.
I found a guy and it looks like the best way is to get him a J1 visa.
how can my company sponsor a J1 visa for him ?

<p>You need to discuss it with an immigration lawyer. <a href="http://j1visa.state.gov/participants/how-to-apply/eligibility-and-fees/" rel="nofollow">J-1 is an exchange visa</a>, usually used by employers for interns, post-docs and visiting researchers/professors. Some graduate students get it too. It is not an equivalent of L1 or H1, and there's no conversion to H1b (there's no such thing called "convert to/transfer H1B" in general. You apply from scratch). <a href="http://j1visa.state.gov/sponsors/how-to-administer-a-program/" rel="nofollow">You have to have a well-defined program</a> for the exchange visitors, its not just a regular employee.</p>

<p>When you discuss the issue with an immigration attorney, ask about <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=8d500b89284a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=8d500b89284a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD" rel="nofollow">H3 visa</a> as an alternative. This is also a trainee/exchange visa, but is more geared towards employers, less towards educational institutions/internships.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that if you're looking for a foreign worker, there's nothing much you can do but to deal with the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=73566811264a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=73566811264a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD" rel="nofollow">H1B visa</a>.</p>
