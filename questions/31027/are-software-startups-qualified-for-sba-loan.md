<p>SBA loans are typically for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exanding businesses that have been running for at least 2 years</li>
<li>Proven income is greater then debt/liabilities</li>
<li>Have sufficient collateral</li>
</ul>

<p>Majority of the time you are correct these are usually for buying a building, constructing a new building, which could be for different types of businesses.  However, SBA loan's are not designed to be startup money.</p>

<p>Probably need to go directly to the bank for that. You will need to show you have or had a good paying job. Have good credit scores. Have collateral etc. </p>

<p>Back when I started (<a href="http://www.webascender.com" rel="nofollow">Web Ascender</a>) web/software/mobile company in Michigan, 2005 I had a great job, excellent credit, money in the bank, and my bank wouldn't loan me anything! 
I didn't shop around, I ended up having enough personally to get it rolling.  </p>

<p>But, I think you can find local banks that are willing to loan. It's supposed to be better than it was - I always hear that banks are supposed to lend X more billion this year. So, call them, ask them. Probably better off with a community bank then one of the big boys.</p>
