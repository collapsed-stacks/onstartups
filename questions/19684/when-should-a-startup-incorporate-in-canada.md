I'm getting mixed answers. A fellow Canadian told me, "No revenue, No Incorporation".

Reading other answers here, I should incorporate early.

I am on verge of entering beta (fire off emails) but have not incorporated.

Currently what stops me from incorporating are:

1. Physical address (don't have office and don't want to use home address).
2. Bookkeeping gets complicated.

I guess I could get in hot water during beta testing. For example if a client abuses my software. 

So the question is, should I incorporate now before launch? I've already paid for hosting, domain, libraries with my name. Does Cheddargetter require incorporation for merchant account?

I was always told that incorporating has no real taxation benefit until your revenue reaches 80 - 100k
