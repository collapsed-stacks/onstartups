I know it's still relatively early in the life span of the Facebook Like button, but I'm curious if anyone here has had a positive ROI from using it. Did it result in increased sales, profits, subscriptions, unique visitors, or whatever metrics you use for success?

Using the FB Like button is relatively new in the internet business game.  It's already showing to have potential profit, and guaranteed "permission based marketing" to people that "Like" what you have to offer.

Without knowing what kind of business you're in, I can't really say how it would work for you.

**Let's run this scenario:**
----------------------------

Say, for example, that you sell cheese.  You sell a particular hand crafted, small farm, back to the earth, doesn't make you fat, kind of cheese.  (Yeah I know, pipe dream.)  You create a website, and FB page for your business.  You use the like button, and customers say they "Like" your cheese.

The like button information helps you two fold... 

 1. You can then do an add that shows to your customers friends that she likes your cheese.  
 2. You can target it to other people who also have a thing for cheese and they'll see that Sally Mae likes your cheese, and they may want to check it out too.

The other thing that you might want to know is that now that Sally Mae likes your cheese, you now have her permission to post things on her newsfeed about your cheese.  She's given you permission to update her, when she selected the Like button.


I have a feeling that the Like button will gain momentum, as long as marketers use it ethically, ie...  don't do a Like button about cheese and then put spammy stuff in the feed stream of those that like cheese.  Read the terms & conditions on facebook and be sure you understand them before you roll out a major Like button campaign.  The downside of doing this wrong is you could get banned from FB.  So make sure you use it wisely.

It's beneficial because it lets a Facebook visitor show the liked content on their FB page. In addition, websiteâ€™s can customize the experience it sends to FB users giving it an additional appeal to web marketers.

For the easy one-click approach this button provides I think it's only going to get bigger and used in more way by savvy marketers.
