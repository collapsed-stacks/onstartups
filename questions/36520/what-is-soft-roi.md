I have heard some people use the term, for example in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCALl1Zizt4) but I cannot find a precise definition of the concept online.

According to [this site](http://www.objectriver.net/roi.htm):

> Though the soft business ROI does not show up as a bottom-line savings, it can be gauged by the efficiencies of a system that responds to business transactions in real-time. Soft ROI also manifests itself as a return in intangible elements, including faster time to market, competitive advantage, brand strength, and customer experience and satisfaction.

There is [another site](http://www.marketingroiordie.com) I think mostly developed to discussion of topics of ROI, which has this to say about [Soft ROI](http://www.marketingroiordie.com/2009/10/04/the-softer-side-of-marketing-roi/)

To make a long story short from what I have gathered.  Soft ROI would be something that cannot be quantified by tangible means like money, assets, lines of code for software, etc.
