I have all my campaigns on [Google AdWords][1], and it is time consuming to improve and manage. I would like to outsource it.

I am looking for someone that can improve the keywords/campaign/ads, so that I can see an improvement in my [CTR][2]/conversion.

It would be an on-going project where the person I hire would have an incentive based on the generated sales. How can I find such a worker? How about in India or elsewhere? Is it possible to find someone on an [Elance][3] type of sites for this?

If I give them my account information to manage the ad, how do I make sure they do not change the budget per day or mess up with my credit card?

We are investors in Trada (http://www.trada.com) and this is exactly what they do.  They use a unique crowdsourced approach where they have numerous "optimizers" helping with every campaign.  You only pay on a performance basis, so rather than paying some sort of agency fee to a black box, you get a bunch of help from a variety of experts.

There's numerous PPC Management agencies, which typically charge 10-15% of ad spend, usually with a minimum of $2500+ per month. Some may also charge a setup fee to get started.

I wouldn't outsource this task to India, that's for sure. You want someone who will provide weekly reports, get on the phone with you, make suggestions on landing page optimization, etc.

About the last part of your question: "If I give them my account info to manage the ad, how do I make sure they do not change the budget per day or mess up with my credit card?"

Google has created a service made for professionals to run AdWords campaigns for clients that lets the clients the control of the budget and credit card. It is called "My Client Center".

See some info here:

What is Google My Client Center ->

So I would recommend you make sure to use this rather than give full control of your Google AdWords account to the outsourcing service.

This sounds like a small project.  Some outsourcing sites we've heard about that are ideal for small projects would be freelancer.com, elance.com, and odesk.com.  I believe these sites have project management features as well as payment options for security, although I am not 100% sure. Just be critical and cautious before signing up and you should be okay.

Does it really need to be offshore outsourcing? I am not sure if it is allowed to post direct links here, try with `www.webbizideas.com`. They are a US-based company that provides marketing services for very honest pricing with fantastic results.

We have been working with them for three years now and they worth every penny we spent (and we are outside of US!).
