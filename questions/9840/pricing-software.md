I'm about to launch a new program in a space that has several large competitors, my program works equally as well but as it's version 1.0 its missing a few features and a bit of polish. My competition prices their apps from $5 per user (100 users) to 50 cent (20,000+) users (perpetual license). Should I aim to be much cheaper or slightly cheaper or should I use a different license type? Example less than 5000 = $1000, between 5k and 10k users = $3000 etc.

Thanks

Give a price break at 10 & 50 users. If you're trying to play catch up, you may want to appeal to companies with fewer users (depending on the market there may be more of them.). 

Be flexible with your trial period if they take the time to request it.

Is there any feature or function you've identified that you have that the other doesn't? I'm with a company that purchased a loan trading application from an upstart company because they were willing to add a lot of reporting functionality for us.

One possible way to compete with larger more established companies is to choose **how** your program competes with theirs, rather than competing over price.

It sounds like your competition is going after large companies and multiple user licenses. You offer few features, so why not choose to compete for **smaller** companies? Go after beginners and very small companies. Make your program **easier** to use than theirs. You offer fewer features so take advantage of that. Make it a marketing choice. Polish your program so it is easier to use than theirs, and the things you don't offer are those that make the program more complicated.

Keep the price the same, or maybe a bit lower. Your marketing should stress the ease of use of your program.

Without knowing any more about your product and the space I can only offer very general ideas for you to consider...

Too much cheaper and you run the risk of saying 'I'm not serious'. Too close in pricing and you're not worth the effort and/or risk as a brand new player.

As a starting point for a price point like this, I'd suggest ball parking a price about 30% lower initially. This is justified in that you have less to offer in terms of features, polish and most importantly reputation. The idea is to use the price difference to cause a serious looker to pause and have a look.

Give it away for free until it has the polish and userbase it needs.  Why would any business use a product by a company that is un-established, when there are established players with better products ? Especially companies with the size you are mentioning.  Say you are in Beta, and let small companies use it for free. It is what StackExchange did (the software running this site) .. now they charge.  Best of luck.

Try to analyze what are your competitive advantages vis-a-vis your competitors. Some factors you may analyze for differentiation are

- Price flexibility - Don't be very stick about price points. Bring customer to negotiation.
- competing feature sets
- Flexibility for Customization for meeting customer specification - You may position your product as base framework and add new features depending on customer needs on T&M ( Time and material ) basis. Initially you may launch Beta version for specific customer and later you may take it to main product line.
- Post sales support
- Identify big pain points of existing customers for your competitors in terms of feature set and address these in your offering
- Road-map - This is one thing which i feel is appreciated a lot by customers.Clear product road-map shows maturity of your company and your commitment for long term play. No customer wants to take risk with company which has no vision for at least next 2 years
