I built a tool for myself and some relatives. It's a windows keyboard tool that allows someone to instantly type accent marks, other diacritics and often used special characters. No key combinations to remember, no keyboard switching in the regional settings.

I am a french expat in Canada and really created it for my own daily use. Starting from there I wanted to test if there would be some interest by others, so I purchased a web template and quickly setup.

My problem is that I don't know where to promote it. When I google some key keywords like "clavier qwerty accents" (this is in french because my beta first targets french people), the results I get usually are forums where people need help typing their accent marks. I can't simply go there, register and say "use keyxpat, it solves your problem". It's understood as spam.

Note that I will also need to target people from other countries (norwegians, germans, ...) and I can only do it in english since I don't speak these languages.

Something that could help thinking about it: a buddhist organization, which translates texts to from sanskrit (with a specific font under MS Word), would like me to add all accentuated sanskrit characters (because it's a nightmare for them), which is something keyxpat can do.

So, where would you go to talk about this tool?

I live in Montreal too and an expat! 

I like your software, there are several ways to promote it actually. If you don't want your post to sound like spam (and you're right, it would be perceived as such), you might consider asking the moderators of the forums to allow you to post on their website. In the end, if you're providing them a solution, they shouldn't say no. 

Alternatively, if you're willing to spend a little bit of money, you can always track Google AdWords and see if there is demand and if there is, you can advertise there. 

My experience is in marketing, and if you need help, let me know, my phone is 514 995 5147. 

*PS: I am not profiting out of this, I am just trying to help.

Though I don't know French language, you software seems nice for any French living in North America.

The audiences are general. And, most likely they won't search such keywords but they will find your software useful once you told them.

I suggest you to test AdWords for Content Network with some geo limitation. For example, targeting French sites/forums but only show ad for IPs from US and CA.

You can also try Facebook Ads with similar targeting, and more specific targeting after generating some user data. Some hypothetical examples, unmarried men might be more interested in your software than aged women, man knows little English rather than fluent English might be a better customer.

P.S. Revised "AdSense" to "AdWords for Content Network" according to Jame's correction.

While you're waiting for an answer more decent than mine, you could start by going to the mall, or at your local cafe.

Spend for 25 coffee drinks (or what budget you can afford) and ask people to spend 3-4 minutes with you (or less, if you can compress your entire presentation) to present and ask what they think.

See what word-of-mouth can help you (if this method works where you reside)

Although it might be construed as stalking where you are (I am uncertain) but if you just ask people coming in -- or near or even just wear a shirt or signboard saying "Stand with me for 3 minutes and get a coffee" -- It might be less of a hassle for others.

Have a netbook or a really small laptop and just talk to people; ensure you won't ask anything personal -- and just ask them how they deal with character accents and other stuff, and ask them to try what you have - no strings attached. The coffee is like a complementary token for their precious 3-4 minutes.

Just to clarify here folks, AdSense is advertisement service by Google in which you enter a code into a website which will then generate ads whereby people can click them and you earn a few cents (depending) per click.

AdWords is the service where you pay money to have your advert appear on Google platforms. 

You're looking for Adwords, not Adsense.
