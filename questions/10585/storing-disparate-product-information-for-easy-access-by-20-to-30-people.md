My company has a weekly Q&A meeting with reps from our Client Services and Development groups.  The purpose of this meeting is to ask complex questions about our product that are beyond the scope of our product documentation but are important for our Client Services to understand during our 10+ month implementations.  The questions are submitted to development a few days ahead of time and the meetings are always very informational and helpful.

The answers to all the questions asked in this meeting are recorded in a spreadsheet and stored on our Vignette Collaboration site.  This is a terrible way to store this information.  Its become a very large file over time, its unwieldy to attach supporting images, and its just generally difficult to access and search through.

Is there a better way to store and access this information given that:

 1. There is no real budget to implement new technology beyond a couple people investing their time.
 2. Third party cloud solution are pretty much out because of security and control conerns.

Any advice?

There are several online tools that allow for collaboration like this.

We use Google Wave for what you're suggesting.  It's easy to attach images, invite people, and look at things later.  Use one Wave per meeting so it doesn't get too large.

Lots of people use Basecamp for this sort of thing; same advantages as Wave although possibly easier for non-technical people to use.

Google is also hoping you'll use Google Spreadsheets, and if the "spreadsheet" concept is vital this might be your best bet.
