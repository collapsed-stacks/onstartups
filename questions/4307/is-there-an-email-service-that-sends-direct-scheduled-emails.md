I am wondering if there's an email service that could help me in the following scenario:

I would like to ask the email address of those who wish to download my software so I can send them useful tips and information during their trial period. 

Are you aware of a service that could help me with this? I don't wanna implement this myself. 

Thanks!

A popular one that several of my past clients have tried is AWeber: http://www.aweber.com/

Its based on a personalized queue (i.e. 1 week after signing up, get email A, 2 weeks after that get email B, etc).
