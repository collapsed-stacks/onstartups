I'm about to develop an interesting, from a functional perpective, extension for Chrome but got a lot doubts in terms of how to monetize it.

I was wondering if it's ok from a legal perspective to change the advertisements in the original page for your own ads.

At a first glance, I thought It is ok since all extensions modify somehow de original page and it is the final user the one that accepts the terms of the extension during the installation process.

Lately, Ive been thinking about it and now I'm not really sure. Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance.
Ivan.

<p>Is it directly <em>illegal</em> with a clear <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Precedent" rel="nofollow">legal precedent</a>? Hmn, maybe, maybe not, depending on which country you're looking at.</p>

<p>Is it something which content publishers and ad networks would absolutely frown at, and would take steps (technical/legal) to block as it becomes widespread? <strong>Absolutely.</strong> You're in essence taking their money and diverting it to yourself.</p>

<p>Don't do this, while it may not exactly be obvious how content owners would notice this and take action, it's clearly not a sustainable revenue stream.</p>
