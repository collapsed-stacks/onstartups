I run a mobile gaming company with my brother located in California, we just contracted a couple independent contractors(ICs) from the UK to do some art for our games. 

Usually, when we contract an IC we ask them to provide their #SS so we can file taxes according. Since people in the UK don't have #SS what do they provide us with? Do they have to apply for a Tax-Id/EIN number? 

FYI: I'm currently doing all the book-keeping myself, it isn't much work since we don't have a lot of money coming in at the moment and we don't have employees. My brother and I are the sole owners of the company, we're established as a partnership. So I figured I would do it in order to save us some money until we have money coming in.

<p>First: I'm not an accountant, or a tax adviser, or anything of that sort.</p>

<p>I've looked into this sort of thing for an affiliate program I'm building. I believe we're in the same boat because in the eyes of the IRS affiliates are independent contractors.</p>

<p>It's my understanding that if your contractors in the UK have no US activities, you simply need to collect a statement from them to that effect. If they have US activities, I think you'd ask them to fill out a W-8.</p>
