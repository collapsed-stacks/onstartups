I'm looking for a basic kit with forms for establishing a **multi-owner corporation** (S-election).    In particular, we want some basic clauses in the shareholder agreement to cover:

 1. buy-sell clause, a la [Texas Shotgun][1]
 2. divorce & inheritance

I've read good things about the Nolo series, but I am unsure about which specific product would be sufficient.  Any advice on this, or a competing product?

<p>Buy-sell issues can actually be quite complex. So much so that Nolo published a book that only covers that topic. The book is <a href="http://www.nolo.com/products/business-buyout-agreements-BSAG.html" rel="nofollow">Business Buyout Agreements</a>. I haven't read the book yet, so I can't say if it's good or not, but I've read several Nolo books, and I haven't been let down yet. The book covers divorce, but I'm not sure if it covers inheritance.</p>

<p>The Business Buyout Agreements book only covers buy-sell issues and assumes you already have a shareholder's agreement. If you don't have a shareholder's agreement, take a look at <a href="http://www.nolo.com/products/incorporate-your-business-NIBS.html" rel="nofollow">Incorporate Your Business</a>. I haven't read this book either (we have an LLC). </p>

<p>Both books are rated highly on Amazon, and both are cheaper on Amazon. There are also reviews on Amazon for both books you can read.  </p>
