I am planning to join a start up (LLC) in a management role. They are in the midst of raising series A, the have agreed to pay me an hourly salary with a cap on the hours, if I go over the hours, they will pay me back when they get investment. In addition, they are offering me a % commission on deals + 5 basis points equity (up to 3 deals) per signed deal I bring in. I will be working as a consultant, not employee. 

Questions

1. If I go over capped hours per week and am owed a certain $, which they have agreed to pay me when investment comes in (I lose all if no investment is raised) - can I ask for this amount to be added to a capital account in my name? This would make me an "investor" in the company, correct? Rather than, just a consultant they owe money to. 

2. How do I can find out the value of 5 bps vs. the entire pool? What is my % share in the company? Should I be asking them for cap tables so I know what my value will be? I'm not sure how bps translate to % and don't completely understand how LLC works.

3. I would one of the first main senior mgmt people to join the company before series A - what should i keep in mind to make sure i am getting  a fair deal?

4. Is it possible to ask for undiluted?

<p>Hmmm - something seems amiss.  In the US - I believe that the company needs to be a C corp to issue stock - not an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company" rel="nofollow">limited liability company</a>. Regarding the commission, a max draw of .15% equity seems to be small, but without any insight to pre valuation and shares outstanding, is is near impossible to determine (a good post on VC algebra can be found <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2004/07/venture-capital-deal-algebra.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>

<p>Owning stock does mean that you're a shareholder in the company (just like owning stock in intel would) but it doesn't automatically grant you any additional rights (depending on the type of share - <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/stocks/stocks2.asp" rel="nofollow">common vs preferred</a>).</p>

<p>And while we would all love <a href="http://www.mcstartup.com/blog/2009/1/19/dilution-issues-for-founders.html" rel="nofollow">non-dilute clauses</a>, they are typically deal breakers for VC investments. YRMV.</p>

It's a big mistake to form an LLC and look for funding. You can't simply convert from one an LLC to a C-Corp the way you can with S-Corp to C-Corp. It would have to be reincorporated or sell all assets to a new (C-) corporation, at which point all prior deals would be erased.
You should absolutely ask what percent (read the cap table) the offer represents.
Why would this position be a contractor rather than an employee? Makes no sense. Frankly they do not sound like they have a clue. VCs and other investors that have a clue will NOT put funds into a vehicle like you describe.
FYI stock IS equity.

The position is a contractor because they cannot afford to pay a salary, so it's hourly wages for a certain # of hours per week. When they raise money then the would hire full time. 

Are you saying that if I were to be granted equity in an LLC, it could go away if they converted to a C-corp?
