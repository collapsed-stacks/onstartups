With respect to selling anything from boots to paintings to pots and pans, what considerations should I be trying to address when creating listings?

Whether you are shopping Amazon or eBay, many products need that tangible feel; for instance clothing and boots and purchasing them without trying them on. What is the best way to try to quell misgivings a consumer has when buying sight unseen? To begin, I assume that having many hi-res images, close-ups, and a sterling return policy can go a long way. What other elements can I as a merchant include in an item's online listing to make a consumer feel effectively educated and firewalled against risk about their purchase?

Having a good return policy is the big one. Other than what you've already mentioned, I would say having images of a model actually wearing your clothes will go a long way. Don't just have an image of the article, post an image of someone wearing it.
