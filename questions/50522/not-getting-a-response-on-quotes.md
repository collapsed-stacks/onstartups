I have recently begun employment in a B2B sales environment. I have only previously worked in a retail environment and have only dealt with immediate decisions on purchasing products. 

I am doing well with coming up with the right product to fit the needs of the people and companies. In the quote I write up a description of the product and include how it will benefit them based on what I have been told.

I send off the quote and wait approximately a week for them to look it over. Approximately 1 in 3 quotes I send out will get the response of "yeah let me look it over and I'll get back to you" or "I'll get back to you" at that point I will follow up once a week or so or just wait. 

Is there something I can do to be more direct like "that's no problem. Do you know when you're going to make a decision?" or something similar that would get me an idea if they are serious or not? 

Or am I doing something wrong?

It sounds like you're doing a great job writing up quotes. You may even be going a little bit above and beyond! 

My suggestion would be that you might have better success gathering requirements (AND DECISION DEADLINES) up front. In B2B transactions, a lot of times you may find that you're being 'shopped' by the purchasing/buyer of your potential client. 

Thus, it is very helpful during the initial request to understand whether you're providing this for work/business that is actually going to be awarded soon, AND **when it will be awarded**. Get a date if you can. 

This will hopefully help you to spend a little more time up front filtering out which opportunities are the most viable. It will also allow you to push stronger sales tactics (more frequent contact) with the opportunities that have said they would be deciding soon. "I'll have a look at it" sounds to me like you got comparison shopped and they were just getting a feel for the lay of the market.
