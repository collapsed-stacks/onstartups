Assume that you are a custom app seller. You get your customers, on all kind of opportunities like events, blind mails, viral marketing. 

When you are at the customer you present your product!

But **how** do you show him your offer that you have a high success rate?

* Do you show him the individual features?
* Do you show him a contract?
* When do you show him the price?
* Do you have process to follow?

Individual features is the most important to show up first, follow by what the interest he will receive by owning your product. The product somehow must be useful for his/her business.No body will simply buy a stuff for nothing in return.If 2 of above things is satisfied, price usually wont be a matter.The rest is just a history. Also dont forget to give a continuous support after he/she having you product.

 1. First you must indetify the problem customer is facing. If you know it already, big plus. If you don't know it, ask the client. 
 2. Once you know their problems, explain or even better show them how your app solves it. That should impress them.
 3. Client will ask for the price. You MUST give him at least a ballpark if you don't have fixed pricing. If you have fixed pricing, show them proposal template and just fill the blanks and skip the next step below.
 4. Go back to your office, draft a proposal where you will mention your terms (licence, subscription, support, maintenance etc) and if you can, give it to the client in person, if you cannot send an email with a phone call follow up as soon as you send it.
 5. If they agree (or after you negotiate the final terms) you will sign a contract and get to work.
 6. You earn some money!

This is my sales process once I get to the meeting with the client.
