As an European, is it possible to travel to the US on a tourist visa and visit companies to apply for jobs or business assignments in person? I. e. is it possible from a legal perspective, from a practical perspective etc? Would there be a difference between applying for jobs (actual employment) and applying for business assignments for a company based overseas (B2B networking sort of thing)?

Please don't hate, I'm just chasing the American Dream like everyone else.

Kind regards

Pongy

You can travel to the US and apply for jobs here, but it is **very** unlikely anyone will hire you. You probably will have a hard time even getting an interview, since you are **not** eligible to work here in the US.

In the current US job market you don't just show up at a company and get an interview. They screen their candidates before interviewing them, and you won't make it through the screening prcess. They will ask for your resume and you will give them a copy- typically by email or mail. They will **eventually** read your resume and immediately notice your lack of US work history. They will then either throw your resume in the garbage or call and ask you about your elegibility to work in the US. Then you will be rejected- all before you ever got an actual interview.

Please be careful.

Whether you obtain a B-2 tourist visa, or you enter with the Visa waiver program, it's not legal to look for a job. Of course you can do that, and nobody will certainly report you for doing that, but that is not legal.

@Pongy, start working out the problem sets and participate in coding contests at interviewstreet.com . You will get noticed by the companies. Once they notice you, they will figure out a way to interview/hire you.
