The most effective way of doing this is to write good and relevant content using those keywords over a period of time that gets linked to by the rest of the web.

Content Marketing has become the current buzz word du jour for good reason ;-)

If you can get people to read the content - and it's relevant - they'll come back.  And talk about it. And link to it. 

SERP rankings are a trailing indicator of success, not a leading one.
