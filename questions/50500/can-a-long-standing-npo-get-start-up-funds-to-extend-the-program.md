I have a [nonprofit organization][1] (NPO) that serves children and was founded in 1992. I have a second location now and want to build a new arm to the program. Can I get startup funds to extend my NPO even though it is 21 years old?

As long as you make it clear its for a new venture within the existing NPO and not money going to sustain the main venture I think you could contact investors or donors who are willing to donate money to startup the new arm. If you could incorporate it under a different name and make it in association with your larger company that could work as well. Perhaps as your larger current donors what they think.

<p>There isn't a formally defined "startup funds" with a set, fixed meaning. You will have to examine your potential contributors individually, and see what their charter and their motives are.</p>

<p>That said, most startup funding will not be available to you. It often falls in one of two categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Private investment, for the purpose of making money. Most VCs, Angels, startup incubators etc are in this group. Of course you're out, as you are a non-profit organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Public investment, for the purpose of advancing a specific 'critically important' technology. Many public grants into green tech, healthcare/medtech etc fall in this category. Not for you, as you don't do research and development.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That said, there is a lot of crossover, and some people do a majority of their investment on a for-profit basis, but leave room for a few social entrepreneurship investments as well. So as said, you'll have to take each potential donor as he/she comes, and get to understand their motives, desires etc.</p>
