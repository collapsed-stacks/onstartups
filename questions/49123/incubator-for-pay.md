Say, I have:

 1. An idea for a tech company / product, that I want to get realized.

 2. Sufficient time, *right now.*

 3. Seed capital, which I am willing also to spend on guidance.

 4. Citizenship in a country in the EU.

 5. The willingness to relocate anywhere.

What I need:

 1. A team: developers / engineers, finance experts, marketers, possibly executives, etc.

    The core team should be available full time and on location. If the company takes off,
    the team should stay. In other words: I am not just looking for someone to build a
    prototype. I am looking for people with full commitment to my business, or - better - 
    *our business.* It should be just like a team set up as part of an incubator program.

    Team members get equity in addition to pay.

 2. Guidance.

 3. Contact to investors, for later.

 4. Physical space.

What I don't have:

 1. Time to apply for a traditional incubation program.

 2. Experience with setting up a business.

 3. Skills to evaluate the quality of the team, or only to some extent.

In other words: Is there something like an incubator, but for pay? Perhaps such a thing is not called incubator after all?

Although I wrote EU above, examples in the US are also OK.
