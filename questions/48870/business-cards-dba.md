I am a designer and I have a client that has an LLC business and they have decided to run another business simultaneously. Because both business share the same space and use many of the same tools and supplies, yet have a completely different customer base the have decided to run this new business as a DBA. 

My question is then, when designing the business cards or flyers and such for the DBA, does there need to be any mention of the LLC like a disclaimer or something?

I have yet to see any information warning of a potential risk in not including the LLC in some way shape or form, but I'm not sure what the legalities are.

Thanks

Bort

No.

It should be on any contracts, however, or other legal documents.
