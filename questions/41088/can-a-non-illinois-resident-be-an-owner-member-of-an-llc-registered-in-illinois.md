<p>Yes, of course. You might want to provide some more details to get some more information</p>

<hr>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=080501800HArt.%201&amp;ActID=2290&amp;ChapterID=65&amp;SeqStart=100000&amp;SeqEnd=1900000" rel="nofollow">statute</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Member" means a person who becomes a member of the limited liability
  company upon formation of the company or in the manner and at the time
  provided in the operating agreement or, if the operating agreement
  does not so provide, in the manner and at the time provided in this
  Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and recursively:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Person" means an individual, partnership, domestic or foreign limited
  partnership, limited liability company or foreign limited liability
  company, trust, estate, association, corporation, governmental body,
  or other juridical being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
