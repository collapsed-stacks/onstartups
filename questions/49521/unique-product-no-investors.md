I've patented my idea in several countries but am having problems sourcing for capital.  I've customers who've indicated their interest in my product but I'm unable to locate funders.  Everyone I speak to thinks it's a revolutionary product.  What should I do?

The fact that your idea is unique is not a good ground to build a business on.

*Why* is your idea unique? Could that be because nobody has been able to build a business based upon it before? 

Who are you speaking to that are saying it's a revolutionary product? Potential customers? Then take pre-orders to build your minimum viable product. Family/friends? Discount their opinions and go and speak to potential customers.

A lot of people will do a 'family and friends' round of funding first to get that initial product built and a bit of traction, *then* go after larger funding rounds.

Another option for you may be kickstarter.com. If you are getting interest from customers, crowdsourcing your product may get you going.
