We are a startup company. We are looking forward to establishing IT managed services. We are looking for a sales agent to sell our services. Our services comprise of monitoring and management of IT assets like desktops, servers, routers, switches and printers. The sales agent needs to sell the managed services contract. The contracts range from 1 year to 3 years. Since we are just starting, we may not be able to pay any base fees to the sales agent to start with. However, the average deal size that we are looking is around $60k/year of which we are ready to give a commission of 20% to the sales agent.

Having recruited sales talent for the last 6 years, the best place I have found so far is from my network on LinkedIn, followed by Craigslist, then the job sites like Monster & HotJobs.
