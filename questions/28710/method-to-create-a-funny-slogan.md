We're trying to develop a t-shirt slogan for out website.

We're going for something funny, that doesn't even really have to do with what our site's about, just something to make people laugh and draw there attention.

Does anyone know a good way to start developing a slogan, any sources on the web that could help out?

How about you change the thought process from 

> We're going for something funny, that doesn't even really have to do
> with what our site's about, just something to make people laugh and
> draw there attention.

to . . .

> We're going for something funny, that has everything to do
> with what our site's about, and makes people laugh and
> draws their attention. 

Having this mindeset will allow you to create a more successful slogan for your t-shirt.

<p>Here is a link to an article from OnStartups with helpful suggestions on developing t-shirts with <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/27988/10-Ways-To-Deliver-Awesome-Schwag-For-Your-Startup.aspx" rel="nofollow">"schwag"</a>.</p>

<p>Try to find a clever, humorous, surprising, or down-to-earth way to describe the main benefit you offer. The example they cite is from Wistia: "Share video like boss."</p>

<p>Try to appeal to your target audience or customer on an emotional level: their lifestyle, their aspirations, their language, etc. Start by analyzing their emotional needs along Maslov's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" rel="nofollow">hierarchy</a> and how that might relate to what you are doing: what are your customers' emotional needs for security, love and belonging, self-esteem, self-actualization and self-transcendence? </p>

<p>Does your product/service help meet any of these? When you identify which emotional need your solution addresses, then it's easier find a slogan that might appeal to them.</p>

<p>The bottom line is: make it human and emotionally appealing. Avoid business jargon like the plague.</p>

<p>Have fun with it, it shouldn't be a chore since it's the soul of your business you're talking about here.</p>

Not a bad idea, seeing how many companies are taking this approach. Geico's are only marginally related, as does Old Spice. And people remember and talk about them because they're funny - and they associate the brand with it and the brand benefits. Little bit different tack than what, say, Apple does, but if your audience would be receptive to this (i.e. younger adults maybe) then you can be very successful with it.

Looking for something, I would recommend a couple of sources. Twitter's full of people trying to be pithy and clever; dig around, or even post up something asking for contributions. Also, check out some of the places online selling these sorts of t-shirts; go to CafePress.com or BustedTees.com for some good pop culture stuff. There might be some guys out there that would let you put your logo on the back or something. Lastly, go ask some kids, if you can find some, both to ask for ideas and especially to run by for their opinions. They'll tell you straight up whether it's funny or lame (and no one wants their brand associated with something lame).

The news may give you some ideas too. Or some marketing or ad companies might be worth the cost, but you gotta have the cash to do so (and take your chances). The best ad company I know of that's done some real popular ad campaigns is Crispin Porter + Bogusky; go to their website and you'll recognize a bunch of their work (and it's amazing). Or even a stand-up comedian or two, who knows - they may be great for this sort of thing.

Fact is, it's hard to be clever when you're trying to be clever. It's too easy to be cliche, lame, or just forgettable. Good luck with it; I'm curious to see what you come up with. Hope this helps!

Sometimes new ideas are hard to find, because we are used to the usual/regular activities, so our brain is trained to think inside the box. To find great new ideas, I think you should train your brain to think outside the box by doing something unusual, creative, and spontaneous.

And, if you want to find funny slogans, why don't you hang out with funny guys?
