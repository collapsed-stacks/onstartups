<p>Can someone be the director of 2 limited companies at the same time?</p>

<p>I'm interesting in starting a UK limited company as a single director. There will be 2 shareholders.</p>

<p>But I also own another company, in a foreign country, where I'm also the single director and shareholder.</p>

<p>Yes you can be director of as many companies as you wish - the only thing to be cautious of is your obligations as a director which can be especially relevant if the two companies markets etc are similar.</p>
