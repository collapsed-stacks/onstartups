I attended Internet Summit at Raleigh, NC for last two days and there were 1400 people there. I wondered how many more will be out there who wanted to attend but could not, for whatever reason. 
How many conferences do you go to every year? The average cost for these conferences usually run in hundreds 

My question to people here is if you are unable to attend a particular event (because of time or money) - Would you consider watching the sessions recordings later on for a fraction of the cost?

Here is the list of some of the topics covered at IS10
 Delivering Social Media ROI
 Future of Cloud Computing (Panel)
 Maximizing Email Marketing
 CIO/CTO Viewpoints (Panel)
 Usability and Customer Experience
 Real Time
 Online Advertising
 Mobile Apps and Platforms
 Enterprise in 2011
 Search Marketing
 Ecommerce in Action
 Social Gaming


I know the one of the biggest reason a lot of people go to the conferences is networking and there is no replacement for that but as far as capturing knowledge is concerned, would you want to watch the video online after the event for a price if you are not able to attend personally.. 

Just a yes/no/may be will do..

No.  So many other things compete for my time.  If you don't put them up for free I am likely to just pass.

As someone else pointed out - there are so many lectures and other quality videos for FREE that you have some unbeatable competition.  You will likely set yourself up for unmet expectations.
