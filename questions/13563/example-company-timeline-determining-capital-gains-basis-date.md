Looking at a hypothetical company timeline (corporation), what is the capital gains tax to shareholders upon entity sale?  (aka, how is the basis date computed)?

`Start date (1st effort of cofounders): 01/01/2011` <br />
` Start date (1st documented expenses): 02/16/2011` <br />
`      Entity creation date (from SoS): 10/01/2011` <br />
`                            Sale date: 03/01/2012` <br />

You should really ask a CPA, but here's how I understand this. This is based on my experience in the US in CA. 

On 10/01/2011 the corportation was created and shares were allocated. You need to decide on a price per share and number of shares. Let's call it $0.1 and let's say that you have 100,000 shares resulting in the company value at this point of $10,000. Let's also say that you want to divide the company between two partners 70/30. So one partner need to contribute $7,000 and the other needs to contribute $3,000. So all your prior expenses, efforts, etc can be part of the contribution that the founders bring to the table. They are not expenses of the company since the company didn't exist yet. So this is your base for the stock.

Now, let's say you sell the company on 03/01/2012 for $500,000. $490,000 is going to be short term capital gain since you held the stock for less than a year. If you want it to be a long term capital gain, you need to wait till 10/01/2012. 

This is the short answer. This is rarely a problem because there are very few companies that manage to sell in such a short time. I guess the problem can arise, if you don't initially incorporate and wait a while to see how your product does.

Normally its based on the dates of the capital contributions or when you fund it.
