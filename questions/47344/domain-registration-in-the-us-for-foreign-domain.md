As is obvious I am located in the US but my customers are in the former Soviet Republics.  So I am looking to register a domain localized for them.

For example most web hosting providers in the US will register `karlsonswidgets.com` or `karlsonswidgets.cc` or `.tv` or `.co` for me, however, most if not all will not register `.com.ua` or `.ru`

Are there any providers that will do such registrations for me?

Quick Google search reveals 101domain.com but I have no idea if they are any good.

<p>I would separate the hosting from the registration process.  Much easier to repoint the nameservers to another hosting company vs. attempting to get a combination hosting + registrar.  </p>

<p>Check the list of accredited <a href="http://www.cctld.ru/en/registrators/" rel="nofollow">.ru registrars</a> and <a href="https://hostmaster.ua/?registrars" rel="nofollow">.ua registrars</a>. there are different requirements to register - for example, .ua allows only trademark holders to register domains similar to the name of the trademark. </p>

<p>Wikipedia has some additional info on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ua" rel="nofollow">.ua</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ru" rel="nofollow">.ru</a> TLDs that may be of interest. </p>
