<p>There are a couple of things that you could do to ramp up your presence quickly:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Leverage Social Media</strong>: This is by far one of the most cost effective and fastest ways of spreading the news about your product/service to the rest of the world. Whether it be setting up a blog, Facebook page, Twitter account or becoming an expert on Linkedin Answers. This is a method which I have seen many companies use extremely well. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Online Marketing</strong>: Optimize your website for SEO and buy relevant Google Adwords in the respective countries that you want to enter to generate leads. This is another great targeted and measurable step you could take to start the ball moving.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conferences/Seminars/Trade Shows</strong>: I am sure there are many such events taking place related to the Food &amp; Beverage industry in the markets that you want to enter. I would start visiting them and networking extensively. The objective will not only be to find prospective customers but potential partners as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Partnerships</strong>: Following on my last point. Once you have developed a network in the countries that you want to enter I would enter loose distribution agreements with local service providers in the same space. This expands your marketing arm with on the ground resources without incurring the costs associated with setting up a presence yourself.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>-</p>

<p>If you could provide more specific information about your business you would be able to get more specific advice. </p>

<p>I have written a post on this matter on my blog as well. <a href="http://www.usmansheikh.com/partnership/taking-your-business-global" rel="nofollow">Taking your business global</a></p>

If you actually want to build a local sales force (hiring people in each country) you will find that it's a significant amount of work as you have to handle payroll, taxes and local regulations in each country.

You would be much better off to hire people in Switzerland and have them travel to the other countries.  I think as long as they are in Switzerland for at least 1/2 of the year then you'll have no taxable presence in the foreign countries and this will greatly simplify things.

If you're looking to hire just 1 sales person many countries will let you do that without actually establishing a business in that country.  If you are looking to have several people in each country you will probably need to setup business, bank accounts, payroll services, legal services and so on in each country.

I would suggest "Channel partnershipS" as a best way to reach new markets with literally no investment. But certain essentials like 'Transparency in business model' and a 'Genuine interest in passing on the benefits' are a must for channel partnerships to succeed.

Good Luck
