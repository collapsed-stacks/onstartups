TheCompany, LLC is a Groupon type service that offers local business discounts in the form of a redeemable voucher.

I, TheCompany.com will offer a platform that businesses can make "Daily Deal" type offers that will be purchased by customers from "where-ever". My profit comes from taking a % of each transaction but keep in mind I'm not actually selling the product.

    I make a commision off the sale of a product.

**For example:**

A customer could purchase a voucher on TheCompany.com to eat one slice of pizza for $1 at Sal's Pizzeria. The customer then presents the voucher to Sal's Pizzeria and receives the slice of pizza.

**The Kinds of Questions I Have:**

 - Do I need to include sales tax as a part of that transaction?
 - Can I make Sal's Pizzeria responsible for managing that on their
   own?
 - If the customer was out of state, how do taxes change?
 - If the customer was in state, but purchased a voucher from a business
   out of state, how do taxes change?
 - Do I need a state business lisence for every state that participates
   in TheCompany.com?

**My Main Concern:**

This is intended to be a scalable solution. TheCompany.com platform has an expectation for growth that will reach businesses and customers nationally over time. I do not want to worry about tax laws in the event that customers buy or use vouchers from different states.

According to this article:

http://www.hodgsonruss.com/Home/News_Seminars/Articles_and_Alerts/TaxingGrouponTypeCouponsNewYorkTaxDepartmentGuidance

"The technical memorandum makes
clear that no tax is due, ever, on
the sale of a certificate."

So to answer my own question groupon type service vouchers are never directly responsible for the sales tax on purchased goods.

I'm a State Tax consultant who has covered the Groupon sales tax issue extensively. I don't usually posts links in comments, but will here because I think you may find some of my information helpful. Here are two articles I've written specifically on Groupons and sales tax. You can also link to more of my articles/blog posts on Groupon and Sales Tax from within these two articles.
