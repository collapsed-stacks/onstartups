I got accepted by BizSpark last week. So now I'm wondering... How do the investor reviews work? How long until I see investor rankings (typically), or do I need to approach people first?

BizSpark is not the best forum to attract investors.  We have been on it for 2 years, and never had one inquiry from an investor.  Its not meant for that.  @Igorek pretty much sums up what BizSpark is good for.

I think its a great idea.  I would much rather program in .net verus php, rails or much other technologies.  BizSpark takes out some of this overhead and allows you to ramp up your business.

To answer your question... go to https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/Startup/InvestmentProfile.aspx and fill out this form. 

After you fill this out, the information about you and your company will be exposed to investors and other Microsoft network partners. Then it is all about patience. 

**Make sure you fill this Investment Profile the best you can**, this profile would help you achieve visibility to potential investors. 

Investors that are interested in your company will do an "investor review" which you can access/view by checking out this page: https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/Startup/InvestorReviews.aspx

Good luck!

Congrats on getting into BizSpark.  My company is there as well, but not sure what it has to do with investment reviews.

Bizspark provides free Microsoft software, MSDN subscription with Azure and some basic support to startups.
