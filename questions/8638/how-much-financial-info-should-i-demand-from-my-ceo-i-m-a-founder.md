## How much financial info should I demand from my CEO (I'm a founder)

About three years ago I built a prototype of a web application.  My partner collected some money from a local angel group so I could quit my job and write code full-time.

My partner was the CEO, tried to do sales and fund raising, and I handled development and customer support.

In about six months, it was clear to me we needed expert leadership.  I talked my partner into stepping down as CEO, and we got one of our angel investors to come on as CEO about a year after I came on full time.

The new CEO is about 20 years older than me and a career salesman.  He doesn't go out of his way to keep me and my partner informed about decisions he makes.  Examples:

1.  When I first quit my job, I set up a modest health insurance plan for us, since I needed one for my wife and my son.  The biz paid 25% of the premium.  About a year later, I got off this plan once my wife started working.  Later I discovered that the new CEO changed the company contribution up to 100% and changed the plan from one of those 80/20 deductible plans to the freakin' rolls royce package.

2.  He hired a friend of his to do SEO (link farming) for us, despite me shouting that the money could be better spent on hiring somebody to write marketing copy.

I could go on all night.  Mostly I blame myself.  We didn't set any ground rules when we brought him in -- I was just a naive developer, and figured he would be "cool".

The most important stuff to me is seeting the income statement and a balance sheet.  Is this within my rights?  Is everything up to the CEO?

More generally, has anyone else been through an experience like this?

I have had many bad CEO experiences and fortunately some really good ones too. Thoughts:

- The most important point I can make is that you need to assume that there's even more bad going on that you don't know about. I can guarantee that if you can "go on all night" with problems you know about, there are more that you don't especially since you say he's not really keeping you in the loop.

- It is YOUR company, fight for it. Have you expressed your concerns about the list of issues? What has his response been? Have there been any improvements or compromises based on what you've expressed? (Without knowing how much you've communicated with him.)

- You don't talk about the financial health of your company (and maybe you don't know if you're trying to see the income statement and balance sheet) but it is a HUGE red flag when this person is clearly putting personal gain above (potentially) the good of the company. Having a cadillac health plan at a startup or early stage company rarely makes sense even if you're swimming in dough and wildly profitable.

- How is control set up? How much of the company does this angel investor/CEO own vs. you and your partner? If you wanted to remove him tomorrow, would you be able to do that or not? How are you setup structurally? Is there a BOD?

- What value has he brought to the company? What would happen if you did remove him? If you do a pros vs. cons, how does it come out? Is he generally positive for the company?

- To your question, absolutely as a founder of the company and an executive of the company you should be able to see the financials. If there is any pushback on that then I would say it is highly likely you need to remove this CEO. He is trying to hide something or trying to have uber control, either being bad given the scenario you described.

Good luck. Would love to hear how things are resolved. Wish you the best.

Just because you did not set any ground rules does not mean you can't start. Alain has an excellent point about talking to this guy about your concerns and putting controls in place. If you can't do that then, you have to go for the nuclear option.

How you deal with this has a lot to do with the structure of your company and the deal you have in place.

If you are a C-corp, then the Board of Directors hires/fires the CEO. They also have the fiduciary responsibility to review the operations and finances of the company to ensure that the stockholders are represented. If you are a shareholder and/or on the board of directors, then you have to review every single bit of financial data and also approve major expenditures and chances in policy.

If you are an LLC, then it all depends on if it's member managed or manager managed. A member managed setup requires that all major decisions be voted on and all operational matters are discussed. In a manager managed, the operating agreement sets up criteria that the manager has to follow before they need approval from the members.

Since you are a small company and most likely a majority owner, you can demand whatever you want. If you sit on the Board, then it's your duty to your stockholders to look into these matters and the board can also fire the CEO.

It does sound like you really have to get this out on the table and discuss how to work together. These are minor things that sound like they annoy you but are not catastrophic.

Assuming this is a C corp, you stayed on the board of directors, right? Anything else would have been foolish. So if you are on the board, technically you are the boss of the CEO: you can ask for whatever you want.

More practically, it doesn't look like the CEO did anything unethical, you are just listing minor disagreements that are bound to happen. Not two people manage a company the same way. I'd first try to mend fences with the CEO, be friendly and constructive.

You both have a common interest: the success of the company. I would ask for information, a little bit at a time, start setting up a regular meeting time with the CEO (lunch or whatever, informal), to discuss how the business is going. Think "brainstorming together", not the Spanish inquisition!

Wow...

I have no experience in running a startup that actually makes money... but I do have experience in investing... and your story sounds scary.

Just like you, I would be looking for financial statements (income, balance sheet, etc). But even then, he could be cooking the books (think worst case scenario, think Enron). The fact that you don't feel you are in the loop is a huge red flag. You need to be on top of the money thing. I would be looking at replacing this CEO as a priority #1.

Can you fire this CEO? How much of the company does he own?
(same questions as Doug: "How much equity do you own ? How much does the CEO ?")

Again, with money, you absolutely need to think of the worst case scenario.

Best of luck to you.
