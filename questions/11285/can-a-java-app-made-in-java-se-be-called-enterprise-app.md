No. You can call your app whatever you want. "Super Great This is the Kitchen Sink" Edition. That's typically what people mean by an Enterprise Edition - their app is capable of handling the needs of an "enterprise" which is generally much larger than a small business.

An enterprise application is supposed to be robust and scalable. And of course, have business value that is aligned with the "Enterprise".
A CD ripping app is not an Enterprise App, no matter how good or great it is.
A CRM, on the other hand, is valuable to an enterprise, and therefore might have an enterprise edition.

Hope this helps

An enterprise application is supposed to have a class - great reliability/supportability blah blah blah...the list goes on and on ...It does not matter how the sofware has been built until it has all the qualities of an enterprise software
