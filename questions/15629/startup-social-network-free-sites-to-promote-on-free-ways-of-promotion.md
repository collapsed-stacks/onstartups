Hey so I am wondering about methods of promoting a social netowork that I made.

Starting up a site and getting traffic is not as easy as it might seem. It would be nice to know how to get some attention through other social networks as well as a list of sites of any sort that can get some traffic.

Can comeone please provide their expertise on promoting it on sites such as digg, twitter, reddit, and facebook, as well as other useful (and free) sites / blogs to be promoted on?

So, you already build the site? Do you have users? Are they one-time users or repeat? Repeat users is what you're after, right?

What problem does your social network solves or whose life will it make easier? If you know the answer -- that's you target audience. Find where they can be reached and pitch you solution (product).

The sites you mentioned had early funding. The capital paid for development as well as marketing. Do you have funds available to hire professionals to "sell your product"?

Free is a relative term. When you use sites like facebook, **you are** the product and they sell your info to advertisers.

Best of luck!
