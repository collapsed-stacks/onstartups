I want to know what type of registration process is required for a software startup, specially in India. My startup specializes in LAMP and .NET. Is Microsoft Empower partner program worth subscribing to?

<p>As a member as of the <strong>BizSpark</strong> program, I can highly recommend this over being a Microsoft Empower Partner. </p>

<p>My reasons are: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NO</strong> initial cost. Sorry A9S6, you are mistaken: as it is completely free to register for BizSpark (the program I think you meant by saying BizTalk). They give you the <strong>option</strong> of after 2-3 years of using the software completely free, you can pay a price of $100 per license for whatever product you have.</li>
<li>Access to <strong>all</strong> software produced by Microsoft, not just Visual Studio. Anywhere from OS's to Office, to Expression Web, to Visual Studio, etc... </li>
</ul>

<p>Find more info <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>.
Hope this helps, </p>

<p>-Nick </p>

I have heard about Microsoft's BizTalk programme for Startups and they charge like $100 to register. Almost all the development licenses are provided free of cost.

This is one good link about how to start and get a registered company in india. The only major thing is to get a name registered. If the company is running as a Sole Proprietorship company, you do not need to have a Service Tax or TAN number. The tax can be paid using your own PAN number.

Registration in India.

 - You can register an LLP in India. But, you need to have at least one Indian partner, if you are living in the US. Also, if you register with NASSCOM or STPI, you will get tax breaks based on the available Tax Holidays.
