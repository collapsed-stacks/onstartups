So, a competitor is announcing that their new product is "patent applied for".

I'd be interested in seeing what their patent application covers - how do I go about finding the patent application to read?

I have the inventor's name, company name, and some keywords, but I haven't been able to find it..

In the U.S., patent applications are not publicly available until 18 months after filing.  An applicant can also request that an application be kept private up until the point that a patent issues.  If you can't find it, it could be that it has not published.

If you post the country, and the details you have, someone here may help you find it.

 http://www.google.com/patents . You can also use advanced mode there, to find by inventor, etc.
