it seems like theres so many black hat SEO softwares out there that helps one spam blogs, forums, and build massive links.

the question is, is it illegal to develop and sell such software ? or is it illegal for the buyer using the software and spamming blogs, forums, and building links for SERP improvement.

CAN-SPAM only applies to spam emailing so i guess these black hat seo software and using it is not illegal ?

There are even professional companies that solely focus on developping black hat SEO software in Canada....how is this legal ?

I don't see why it would be illegal to create black hat SEO software. However, you could violate some companies' policy (i.e. TOS) by blindly spamming their website.

Black Hat vs White Hat SEO is more Unethical vs ethical than the legal counterparts. Often the particular technique may be in some form violating terms and conditions of various websites, or may result in the eventual strengthening of the terms.

Regardless, black hat essentially deals with things that can be used until you are caught, sort of like anything illegal. Of course I haven't heard of any individual or company doing time for cookie stuffing, blank referrers etc. Nor do i recommend it in any way.
