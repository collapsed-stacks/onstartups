I'm not sure I understand your question. I think what you are asking is what action or event starts the life of your LLC (i.e. causes your LLC to become official). If that's what you're asking, then the answer is when you officially register your LLC. As soon as you register your LLC it becomes official, even if it takes you months to hire a freelancer.

If I misunderstood your question, can you please elaborate?
