I am currently prototyping my web application. I need a web designer or in lieu of that, a good resource where modern web application templates (web 2.0 in style) can be purchased. The template sites I've seen are somewhat behind the times.

my budget is quite limited. Any recommendations?

To elaborate on what Andy has said. I would suggest you register a GoDaddy economny hosting at a cost of 7 dollars a month and then use their turnkey system to use get Wordpress working.  From there,  you could use one of their defualt themes or a template from one of the template stores such as the one that Andy has pointed out.

The cheapest web designer is no web designer at all. :) 

I'm not a GoDaddy employee or anything. I just know they can get things done and FAST.

I've used themeforest to buy a theme for a prototype I built a few month back. They have a pretty large choice for very cheap. I bought mine for $12.. Careful there is a $2 fee for Paypal payment but anyway. It had a login screen template and a full page with plenty of divs that I've used an reused very easily. I found it to be a good experience overall.

If you got a little experience in web-designing and know a bit about web servers then you can work out on free CMS available.
To name some:
Joomla
Drupal
Wordpress
DotNetNuke

There are loads of available for free and so are their themes. If you want some specialized themes then you need to pay, else most of it is free to download and use. Also these open source CMS have very good support from all the users around the world.
Alond with these CMS you can get a lot of readymade modules & extensions available and again free.

Gud Luck!
