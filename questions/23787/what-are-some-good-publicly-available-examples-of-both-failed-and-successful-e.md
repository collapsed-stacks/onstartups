What are some good examples of elevator pitches - ideally examples that represent typical successful as well as typical failed pitches? (I'm looking for examples which match what you normally might see, not examples which are extreme or unusual).

An example of good pitches that could be useful can be the MIT 100k Elevator Pitch Competition.
