I am currently building a construction business that is heavily driven by systems and processes, the system is built on the basis of engagement and transparency at all levels to ensure that projects are delivered on time and budget.

I currently have 5 partners who have an average of 25 years in the construction business and we all feel we have a great idea plus we are already building the system,

**My question is, its it possible to get funding at this stage of the business and if so how?** 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

You're in the UK ... so you should look for Government-subsidized funds that have a political agenda, i.e regional development funds, greentech programs cosponsored by the EU, and similar.

Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but most pure Venture Capital investors won't touch you. If you read about VC, you will understand that VCs make their living from the occasional breakout superhit, the one company which returns 100x the invested money within a couple of years. Construction businesses can't expect to grow that fast.

You could try angels, especially if you can find angels which have a background in construction.

But your most likely bet is UK/EU-subsidized programs which have an additional non-profit side goal, such as advancing green energies, or whatever fits with your concept.

Try to presell any work you have lined up and secure contracts. Investors will be much more willing to listen to your pitch if they know you already have income coming in. 

Also identify what type of investor you want and why you want them (strictly funds, experience, introductions, etc).

You'll want to stay away from high growth investors. Look for potential prospects by visiting your local Chamber of Commerce (or equivalent in the UK). Also look for government driven projects for local, smaller businesses.
