As simple as this, I started 2 months ago online business to sell software, then I put ads on Google, I do get clicks and impressions.

But I feel that I'm not really understanding how to get the best out of my ad camping.

Is there any book, resource, articles, blog where it explain the principles of Google Ads, and hot to really get the click you desire.

Thanks,

<p>I learnt from Perry Marshall's e-book about 5 years ago when I started:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.perrymarshall.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.perrymarshall.com/</a></p>

<p>It was quite useful. I assume they have kept it up to date as the system has changed. If nothing else, you will learn what it is like to be relentless marketed to!</p>

<p>Google also has a lot of free documentation.</p>

<p>Adwords is a complex system and Google gives you lots of opportunities to give them money and get nothing useful in return. So start with a small daily budget and build up from there. You may save money in the long run by employing a knowledgeable consultant to help you get started.</p>

<p>A good place to start is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470152524" rel="nofollow">AdWords for Dummies</a>.  I was actually quite surprised at the depth this book went into AdWords.  It's more than a simple overview.  It's really helped me with my own campaigns, and the author, Howie Jacobson has plenty of more information available via newscasts, podcasts, download-able pdfs, and more.</p>

Get your hands dirty. Take a little bit of money and invest in your website for Adwords and see how it works. It can be less tan 50 doallrs a month. You learn a lot by actually doing than reading in my experience.
