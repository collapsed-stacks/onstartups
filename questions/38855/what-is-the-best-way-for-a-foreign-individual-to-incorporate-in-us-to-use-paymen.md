My business model is subscription based therefore I need to use a payment service that is practical for this purpose. Unfortunately, as far as I researched, such services are only available to US individuals or companies, however I am outside US. (Merchant providers, BrainTree, Stripe etc.)

**[Q]** What is the best way to incorporate in US for only this purpose?

- Lets assume total monthly income is 100K$ and monthly cost is 20K$

It would be great to get a solid answer with numbers, I have been researching for a long time with no luck. The best I could come up with is to form a LLC, but in this case its not clear how I will be taxed since I'm not in US.

Having helped more than 30 foreign clients launch businesses in the U.S., I can tell you that the only **effective** way to incorporate will be to use the services of both a lawyer and an accountant / tax advisor who have substantial experience working with foreign clients.

Even then, while incorporating and obtaining a bank account should be reasonably straightforward, signing up with a payment service will be a challenge - but potentially feasible, given the level of revenue that you anticipate.
