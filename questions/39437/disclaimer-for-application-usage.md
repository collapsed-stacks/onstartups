I'm building an application that lets users upload images from their desktop. (A FTP kind of program)

Where do I find a disclaimer text for a program like that? Something that says "*I'm not liable/responsible for any damages... / Use at your own risk...*" 

I'm not sure what I explicit need to mention to be on the safe side.

Thanks.

You should start with reading few disclamers from other existing apps which are almost identical (if any) or at least partialy include same features as your app. I'm sure there are lots of points you could easily copy/adapt. However, before you release, it should be reviewed by a competent person.

You should really go to a lawyer and get something specifically written for your site and your situation. I know this costs money, but believe me, court cases are far more expensive.
