Does it make sense to sign a vesting restriction for myself, if I'm a single founder of my company?

You can't - someone has to own the shares. If you're the sole founder, and created the company, then you would be sole shareholder, and hence, you cannot vest. Vesting only works when there's a transfer of ownership, in most cases, from the original founder(s) to the new parties.

Elie makes a good point about founders shares and vesting. As for founders shares, those are "given" or fully vested when issued even if you have more than one founder.

One thing that a C-corp can do is provide stock options to it's employees. Since you are an employee (albeit the only one), you can have a vesting schedule for stock options.
