I have developed a new technology for making highly efficient power supplies.

Included in the package are  new current mode control circuits as well as a new high speed power switch - its new because it does not use semiconductors; ie., MOSFET, IGBT etc.; but does perform high speed (RF speed) PWM control.
 
Built around a low cost high speed real time energy computer with built in APF etc etc. The main point is that this PSU does not suffer heat losses and offers high efficiency power control.

There are several "firsts" involved; this is the reason I used the word concept.Presently, I have no intention to start manufacturing since I am a design man. Thus I am in search of a good way to either license this or something which will allow me to retain my IPR's.

Buyers or lincesees would usually be interested in truly new technologies. One sure way to prove that your concept is new and thus valuable, is to patent it. This not only protects your invention, but also proves its value. Then, you also need to show the potential market for your concept.

Address a problem / pain point of the target customer.

I think the typical way is:

1. state problem
2. explain your solution
3. make sure you clear any concern they might have about your solution (cost, time, workload, risks)


If you cannot find a problem, look for a "use case" that will demonstrate the value of your concept.

In fact if you have developed it, I would rather word it as "product" or "solution" rather than "concept".
I would stay away from the word "concept" as it sounds like it's just an idea, and the customer will like to see a working solution.

Hope it helps.
