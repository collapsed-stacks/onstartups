I just visited your website and was lost in all the information that was available. Some of the steps you could take would be:

1. Clean up your website design and make it a little more friendly to navigate and truly understand what value you bring to a client when they hire you.

2. Start a blog on the benefits and importance of Q/A & Testing. You will be surprised as to how many companies learn this the hard way.

3. Make your case studies easier to read and understand where you bring value. I tried to go through one but it felt like a technical manual rather than a case study.

Apologies if my feedback was a bit harsh. 

Hope this helps.

I looked through much of your site, and the suggestions by Usman is valid.

Your case studies, at least the ones I looked at, didn't really tell me much, as it summed up to, did testing, found problems, product successfully released.

But, it is missing what the process was like beforehand.

For example:

> Software development team used agile
> process with TDD, but had problems
> with software quality.
> 
> We helped improve their automation,
> and they had 20% fewer bugs after we
> started.

This would then help to give an idea, but it is important to know what tools were being used by the team, and what processes were in-place before, and what you added.

If a team has a solid unit-testing system in-place, that will also mean that much of the functional testing is being done, that is non-gui, so what do you offer for that?


What tools did you add to their system?

How reliant is the company on you afterwards? Does this become an endless contract, or do you give enough information that they can continue with the new process without you?

"About Us" text sounds like a shameless self ad. OK, here is a great way to target software developers: (instead of these ads) try to write an awesome blog about/for software developers. Write about their biggest problems, which don't necessarily belong to the development itself. Themes like starting a startup or getting a great job, marketing and finances for geeks, new platforms and programming languages. Do you really need a good example of a blog like this?

I agree with Oleg. While all entrepreneurs are involved in self promotion of their products and services to some extent but it should be not be like "About Us".
Write some thing useful or interesting. for eg I am promoting the driving tests on my site and I though why not to write about my and my wife's experience while taking road test.
