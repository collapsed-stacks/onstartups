We are in stage of market validation and working with few early adopters to mature our software product that targets a niche market. Potential customers can fill out a form for a trial download and we send them the download link. Today one of the competitor, which is a large enterprise software company with too many softwares under its belt, requested a download. They have some products that kind of slightly overlap in certain areas of what we are doing.

Few possible options could be:
1. They really need the software for their own needs.
2. They might be looking at us from an acquition point of view?
3. They might use our software to get ideas to develop one in house.


Question for the community is, should I send the download link to the competitor? Why and why not? and If yes, should I include some specific wording in the email?
Thanks.

I would treat them just as any other customer.
If they want a deal, they should ask directly for that.
If they intentions are politically incorrect, like see what you have to copy ideas or to detect patent infrigement or other alike, they could use a false identity anyway.

 1. Unlikely.
 2. Low probability
 3. I'd say that's it

Get some software protection put on your executable (i'd recommend ASProtect or Themida) and send it to competitor.
