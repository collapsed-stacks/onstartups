I have been offered a job at a pre IPO company for X shares at some Y price. I was told that these stocks will be worth around 8x at the time of IPO.

How is the value of these stocks determined? What questions and information should I ask my employer to better ascertain what this means? The worst case is that they will be worth zilch, but what is the possible best case and how do I determine that?

The company is doing very well and has good growth, so I'm confident that the IPO has a good chance of happening.

Maybe read Venture Deals by Brad Feld to get a good idea about how all this stuff works and the potential pitfalls.

It is very difficult give you a meaningful answer here, as you can't provide enough information without compromising your position.
