I have an idea for web based service. I need a template for a Product Requirement Document (PRD), so my partner and I can flesh it out prior to having funtional development spec. Is there a PRD guideline or template doc out there??????

I have been searching for the same info, although I must say, I am getting confused since many of the terms are used interchangeably (Product Requirements Doc, SRS, etc.).

Go to this article: http://www.techwr-l.com/techwhirl/magazine/writing/softwarerequirementspecs.html#comment-457

It is PACKED with template links and resources.  Let me know if you find one that works...I still need to do this too!

Your best bet would be to develop a Marketing Requirements Document (MRD), which is kind of what you explained above.

What has worked for me is the following process:

##Step 1: Understand The Customers Pain##

* What do they do now?
* Who are their customers?
* Survey the entire ecosystem

##Step 2: Understand Your Competitors##

* Current Product Offerings
* Competitor Roadmaps
* Research trade journals and papers

##Step 3: The Essence of The Product##

* Brainstorm Descriptive Words
* Describe The Pain
* Solve The Pain
* Show Why Your Different

##Step 4: Craft Core Requirements##

* Define The What, Not The How
* Run Usage Scenarios
* Keep Refining The Core

##Step 5: Define Nice To Haves##

* Be disciplined about not adding too many features
* Challenge your assumptions
* Include the next revisions features

##Step 6: Layout The Business Case##

* Figure out your costs
* Understand the market demand
* Define how your business or product will succeed

##Step 7: Send Out For Review##
Find someone that you trust and have them review your draft MRD. The best reviewers are ones that can give you constructive, tough feedback.
##Step 8: Repeat And Refine As Necessary##
It will take many iterations to get this right so be flexible and open with comments and try an incorporate as much detail as you can.
