I'm interested in hearing from programmers & computer scientists who have started their own company. What is the general nature of your business and how did you play a part in starting it?

Any recommended reading for business-minded programmers would also be greatly helpful to myself and anyone starting a tech venture of their own.

<p>I suggest you find a copy of <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/" rel="nofollow">Founders at work</a> and read it.  It is interesting and compelling.</p>

<p>It is also worth subscribing to the <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html" rel="nofollow">Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders podcast</a>.  There are some outstanding episodes in that series.  (Also some duds)</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I only name those because I think it will satifsy the craving for real-world stories that your post implies and the second one is a good survey of lectures/discussions from people who have "made it". </p>

<p>I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon of popular business literature so I won't recommend any books for practical application of things that worked FOR OTHER PEOPLE.  You have to go out and try things on your own and make your own mistakes. </p>

I started a business with two other programmers. Our model was similar to 37signals' model - offer consulting services to earn immediate profitability (we are bootstrapping our business and not taking outside funding), while building our own products. I've always been a business-minded person, so my role was to handle the sales & business development, marketing, account management, project management, and product management aspects of our business.

Books I would consider Must Reads are:

 - **Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore** - he talks about the Technology Adoption Curve and how it relates to the marketing & sales strategy of your business. A product VP at a former company had recommended this book to me when I made the transition from developer to product manager. The follow-up books are also great.
 - **The Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma by Clayton Christensen** - he talks about Disruptive Technologies and their patterns in the marketplace. The follow-up books are also great.
 - **Founders at Work by Jessica Livingston** - she interviews various startup founders. I found this book insightful & inspirational.

I just purchased this book, after hearing great things about the author and his Learn Startup philosophy (you've probably heard of it by now too):

 - **Four Steps to the Epiphany by Steve Blank**

I don't mean to seem spammy, but I do have a list of other great business reads on my site. The first three are my top suggestions. For more, you can look here:

I hope this helps. Good luck!
