I have launched a CodeIgniter PHP Code generator and now planning for marketing. I have compared with the competitors and found my tool has many advanced feature that others didn't have. But I am not sure how to reach the users by competing with companies who have similar tool. Because I am a single developer who is working on it so I don't have much money to invest in the marketing of this.

You must define your competitive advantage in the minds of your customers.  Attach this advantage to the cost difference between your product and others.
