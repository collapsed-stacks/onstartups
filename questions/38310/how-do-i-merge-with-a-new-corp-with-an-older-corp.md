I'm incorporating a new c-corp in Delaware with a new co-founder. 
So, I want to merge the older new york c-corp because it has all my copyrights and trademarks assigned to it. Also, the New York c-corp has no business activities and I'm the only  owner. I want to do it on my own because lawyers will cost me at least a $1,000 to merge. The idea I have is the Delaware corporation buying all the stocks of the New York company but not sure if it will work correctly.

Your idea won't work -- all that does is create a New York subsidiary of the Delaware corporation.

Why don't you just transfer the relevant stuff over to the new Delaware corporation?  If you haven't registered either your trademarks or copyrights, that's a really easy thing to do.

If you want to merge, you'll have to deal with the requirements of both Delaware and New York -- mainly filing a certificate of merger with the Sec'y of State in both states.  That alone is going to run you around $360.
