I've started a small web development agency in Cambridge, Uk and I'm just to busy to handle all the work load...I feel like I'm missing out on potential work and I'm starting to drop the ball in some cases. 

First of all do I find a partner on an employee. I'm scared of the risk of employing as this is all very new. 

Secondly how do I find them? I've tried local boards and listing but haven't found anyone suitable yet...

Thanks for your time

**Consider bringing on a freelancer.**

A partner is a decision best made with careful consideration - you don't go to a local hangout and marry the first person you meet.  Likewise, hiring a employee is a fiscal responsibility that you bear regardless of your workload - (s)he needs to be paid - regardless of your cash flow. 

Once you can determine whether this work spike is a short or long term condition, you will be better prepared to make the partner / staffer decision.

Charles,

This is probably a delayed answer. Nonetheless, it might help the readers.

The asset you (or anyone in your position in the UK, US or W.Europe) has is the local reach & the skill in your profession. Capitalize on it. 

It's absolutely the number 1 choice, to go hire someone (employee commitment is different from any other form). You could get a freelancer (through your known circles.)

There is a 3rd option which is riskier but very rewarding if you get it right. Find a great dev shop that is not in your market, that shares your philosophy of producing great work output.

Find a good web development company in India or Eastern Europe is like searching for the needle in the haystack. But that effort is truly worth it, if you can discover a small dev firm that creates products like the best in the valley.There are a handful in each of these markets. Partner with them. Be their GoTo guy in the UK. This helps you scale, while maintaining quality and keeping overheads low. You could then slowly build you client facing team in the UK while still having a great dev shop as a partner.

I've known of companies that did things this way and eventually merged to grow.

Shoot me a note if I can help!

PS: I run a web development vendor discovery platform called ContractIQ. So I see versions of your question asked every day :)
