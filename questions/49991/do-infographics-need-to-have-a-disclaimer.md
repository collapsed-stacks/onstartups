I would like to create some infographics to publish them on Pinterest, twitter and the blog on my website.
As my infographic will contain some public available financial data about companies listed on stock exchanges, I am not sure if my infographic should have a disclaimer.

I came accross this [infographic][1], which has some financial info on it and contains this disclaimer, which makes me wonder if I should add a disclaimer too: 

> This infographic has been produced for information purposes only and
> should not be considered as investment advice.

What are your thoughts on that?

*Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, you should talk to a lawyer and shouldn't take legal advice from some random person on the internet.*

The infographic you linked to speculates about the future price of gold, telling someone "the price of gold is going to go down/up" is actually investment advice - so obviously you have to put a disclaimer telling you that no, this is actually not investment advise to tell someone it's time to sell/buy some gold.

If there's any suggestion (however small) in your inforgraphic about the future stock value of the company than it can be considered investment advice, if you make no interpretation about the future you may be safe (unless some idiot misunderstands and decides to sue you).

It's just like the disclaimer at the top of this answer, it's blindingly obvious this answer is actually legal advice so I put a disclaimer on it to protect my, hemmm, backside (at least I didn't say this answer is for entertainment purposes only).
