<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

I know there is a topic regarding AdWords and Mac OS. There's no solution though.
We have an application that we want to start selling out. The application is for Mac OS X. We dont have (and dont wanna have :)) a version for Windows. 

How can we buy users who are on Macs only? Is there any way? Maybe some PPCs other than AdWords? I cant believe everybody buys all traffic from AdWords and then separate it by OS.

You could buy adverts (even Adwords content network ads) on Mac focused website(s).
