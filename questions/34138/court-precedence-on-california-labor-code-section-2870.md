Does anybody know of any actual court cases involving California labor code section 2870 which gives a clear precedence as to how judges would rule in such disputes 

(eg. a programmer makes something on the side while being employed in a company whereby that labor code applies...the employer then sues the programmer and claim IP ownership of that side product...a legal battle ensues...)
