Funding your company is an important part of your startup and expansion strategy. It's a broad topic that has a lot of aspects including: keeping your idea secret, seed funding, angels, venture capitalists or boot-strapping.

Each company is unique and so is the funding strategy. The common thread among all startups is they do need capital and obtaining that capital takes a lot of effort and focus -- something most technical founders hate to spend time on.

"keeping your idea secret" to be honest. This is one of the worst things you can do for your business. I promise you that noone, NOone will copy your idea no matter how brilliant it is until it has validation in the open market. Then everyone will copy it :). People are too consumed with their own ideas and projects to even consider copying yours. The best thing you can do is too tell everyone and everybody what your idea is before you invest a lot of time with it. It will only give you validation and insight among a diverse group of people. Your eventual audience.
