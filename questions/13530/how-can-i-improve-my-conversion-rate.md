We've yet to start beta, as we would first like a large user base to start with. But our conversion rate to sign up for beta isn't the best. Any advice on that front is appreciated.

I tried your web site and the sign up works correctly *(as far as I can see).*

**However starting from the top:**

 1. Your logo is unreadable
 2. You do not explain **well** what your site does or how it benefits me
 3. The English on your main page and the page you see after sign up is poor

So why should I sign up?

Its because your website doesn't work. I tried pressing the signup button and nothing happens. You want to test your website first before asking this question. Once you make sure the signup works. I can help you.

Generally you'll only have to change some minor things to increase conversion rate but first of all, make sure the signup works. If it works for you, clear your chache and cookies and try again. It didn't work for me.

If it is a problem with the signup, then wait it out. Keep us posted and let us know if you still have bad conversion rate.
