<p>We have an online service for creating and sharing work instructions. After a private demo of the software, companies usually go for a free 30-day trial. In our software, we define an administrator account (for the person who requested the trial) when we set up the customer's environment and let him create all other necessary user accounts. </p>

<p>My question concerns the Terms of Service and who should accept them: should it be the administrator only (in the name of the entire company) or should each new user added by the administrator also have to accept them when they login for the first time?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>The best for you should be the ToS "accepted" by the company</strong> --> let the company to take care of the respect of these rules by it's employees.</p>

<p>It will be easier for you from several points of view:</p>

<ul>
<li>it's better to <strong>be in contact with one responsible</strong> than with 50, 100, ... users individually</li>
<li>the <strong>company is always more eager to respect rules and contracts than the individuals</strong> (company has more responsibility)</li>
<li>if you go for the "user responsibility" imagine this case: one of the users abuses your ToS. Will you suit him personally? Or as an employee of the client? And what if he is not employee anymore?</li>
</ul>

<p>So indeed it depends on the wording of your ToS but <strong>in most cases, it would be in your favor to have the client company (as legal entity) be globally responsible for the respect of your ToS.</strong></p>
