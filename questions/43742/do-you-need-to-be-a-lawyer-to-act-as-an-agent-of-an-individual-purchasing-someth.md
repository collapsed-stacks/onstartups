I am in the very early stages in looking to start a business in which I help individuals purchase cars on their behalf, so they do not have to deal with the dealership, an experience most people do not enjoy. I have done some preliminary research and before going forward I was wondering if I needed to be a lawyer to represent the individuals at the dealership. I would have clients sign their own documents, I would just help get the deal that the client is looking to get, without them having to deal with the dealer, as mentioned above. Any advice on this potential issue would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.

<p>One need not be a lawyer to act as the agent of another. (Please see, e.g., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_%28law%29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia discussion of agency</a>.)</p>

<p>However, I can see practical challenges (legal liability; contractual requirements; dealership resistance; pricing sensitivity; etc.) that would make it difficult to run such a business successfully and profitably.</p>
