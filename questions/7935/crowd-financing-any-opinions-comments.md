What would your SWOT analysis say for following kind of website?

phase 1: Get people/organizations who are looking for financing their projects.

phase 2: Get people who can provide finance to these projects (however small)

Arrange for pooling in the amount, financing and other legalities through this website.

I know this is too brief, but that's intentional, as I would like to provide more information based on your questions and inputs.

There's already a site that does that: <http://kickstarter.com>

Or do you mean something different?

<p>Perhaps a look at <a href="http://microplace.com" rel="nofollow">Microplace</a> (an ebay company) is in order here.  </p>

<p>Don't just think that its only for third world investing - <a href="https://www.microplace.com/investments/details/ACCION+Texas+via+Calvert+CI+Note" rel="nofollow">here's a group in texas</a> that provides loans to small businesses.</p>

<p>Sure, they are broker-dealers / FINRA members - but that's the cost of doing business. </p>

<p>I would think that a "microISP growth" filter with some third party validation processes would work using this approach. </p>
