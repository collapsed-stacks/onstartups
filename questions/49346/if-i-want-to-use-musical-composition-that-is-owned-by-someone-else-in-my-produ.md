You need to address the distributor or owner of that musical composition's publishing rights. They may both hold the rights to the content. Most of the time for commercial music it's the publishing label. Or it may be that an independent artist has published the composition under their own labels (which is like a business). You'll likely enter a contract to gain rights to display/broadcast their work.

Search the track by name and artist, try find the legitimate owner and contact them. This is not legal advice and you should seek the right advice for your situation.
