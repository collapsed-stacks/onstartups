We've this 3 year old, profitable startup going steady 

 - We sell web templates and web apps
 - Last 12 month's gross sale is over $1 million with 75% profitability
 - Staff of 13 people working on site

I've decided to sell the company because..

 - Want to sell it when everything is going fine. 
 - I am tired of running this one, losing passion ever so slowly.
 - I have some other ideas that I wish to explore


My question to you are..

 1. **Where exactly** do I find right buyer for this company? Is there any specific broker/companies that can help us find a buyer? Whom to approach?
 2. What kind of **valuation** we should expect for our business?
 3. Anything else I should be aware of / look after?

Any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.

That would appear to be fairly profitable.  Have you considered having someone else run it so that you have a steady income on the side while you pursue something else?

As for selling it:

 1. competitors - always potential buyers
 2. large sites specific to your niche - (assuming you specialize in something like wordpress, drupal, or some other cms)
 3. industry experts in your niche who may not have a strong monetization system

As for valuation:

 1. what is your niche? is it one that is growing or declining?
 2. why are you better/worse than the competition?
 3. is it scalable upwards or are you fairly plateaued?
 4. are revenues up last year or down from previous years?

Templates are an interesting item with themeforest being an obvious powerhouse - most people know to look their first or one of the specialty sites.  I would try and figure out your chance at long term success before I was willing to invest (you know assuming I won the lotto).  But, given the industry and the need for always fresh themes - I would probably want to pay 1.5x-2.5x.  This is the reason I asked the other questions.  Those questions frame understanding of the situation, but you may be better off keeping it and paying someone else to manage it.
