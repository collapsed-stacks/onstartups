Can you guys tell me how to split the revenue?
I will be the director and hire 2 programmers with one artist. I am also going to try to partner up with a big company for advertisements. This is for a free app on the Apple store

I would give everyone else the entirety of the revenue.  It will make you look really generous.  

I am assuming you won't mind as you mention it's a free app, so there will be no revenue anyway.
