I was just watching a few of the TechCrunch50 videos, and I really liked the Yext pitch the most - http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/yext/.

Any of you guys here have recommendations for some very polished up start-up pitches? Thanks ahead.

Although this isn't a pitch, it does provide such insight into pitching that I felt it was worth adding.
