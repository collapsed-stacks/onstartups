I've seen a few posts on this site about crowdsourcing which imply that it's not possible to use kickstarter outside the US. 

I'm wondering where does this information come from ? Any sources ? I couldn't find any. 
Also, these posts are a bit old (more than 1 year). I was wondering if it's still the case ? 

I'm based in France

<p>Since <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-in-the-uk" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter is launching in the UK at the end of the month</a> - yes it's possible ;-)</p>

<p>I think that what you may have heard about is the issue of having crowd-based investment of companies (ie when folk get partial ownership). I am not a lawyer, but I recall reading that this is a tricky issue legally. You'll need to ask a lawyer/expert about that.</p>

we have some alternatives to kickstarter in germany but the problem is that there are not many investors.

the mentality of people here is not like in the u.s.

another problem is that we have different languages in europe. so the crowd is mainly state based and not big enough.
