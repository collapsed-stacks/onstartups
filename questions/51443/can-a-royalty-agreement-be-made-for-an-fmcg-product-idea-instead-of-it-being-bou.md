<p>I am the ideator that's put together the idea and packaging for an FMCG product. </p>

<p>I'd prefer to have royalties paid to me instead of the idea and patent being purchased from me (by a company) once-off when it's too early to tell the true worth of the product. Also, a once-off purchase restricts me from approaching other FMCG outlets.</p>

<p>Yes it's called licensing.<br>
You sell the company right to manufacture and distribute the product.<br>
Now as far as approaching others, that may not workl out so well for you. Normally these agreements are exclusive. So you'd only be able to approach other companies once the contract ends. It's also bad business practice. When you license a product to someone else, you effectively partner with them, so in approach others, you're "screwing" your partner, which is never a good reputation to have in business.  <a href="http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/license_assign_patent.htm" rel="nofollow">To License a Patent or assign</a></p>
