I was just wondering if it is common to ask your co-founders to get their signitures notroized? I trust these people as we are good friends so I don't want to offend them if I asked to get it notorized. This this normal for business start ups?

Thanks.

You notarize a signature in order to ensure that it was them who signed. They can't deny that later on. If you're going to do that, tell them that you all need your signatures notarized, including yours, as a decent business practice.

P.S: Doing business with friends could destroy the friendship if your business relationship goes bad. Good luck!

No, it is not common.  The main case where you want a signature notarized is when there's some risk of fraud -- you're concerned about somebody ELSE signing instead of the person who actually signs.  So, the DMV wants to make sure that you're allowed to sell the car, and the bank wants to make sure that you're not taking a loan out in somebody else's name.

When you're talking about the founding documents for a company, you don't really have that issue.
