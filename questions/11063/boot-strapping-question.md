what kind of legal documents are required in doing case studies with your clients ?

what other forms of bootstrapping is there ? case studies, testimonials....

another concern I have is, are there any risks or downside of bootstrapping, or doing case studies with your client ?

im curious as to how to ask if i could use their logos, inputs,....basically need some guidance on how to approach companies to do case studies on....do i offer to work for free or give my software for free ?

a bit confused by your question. bootstrapping and case studies are different things.

If you have a client, and want to do a case study on your work together, look at your contract first and make sure you understand IP and confidentiality agreement issues.  Then, regardless of whether you need to or not, go ask permission to do the case study. Get the client's involvement and participation. Get their quotes. Get their agreement to what you can share on the Web. Case studies can be a nice marketing tool and proof point, especially if you can convince your client to share metrics of any useful kind, but don't burn a bridge with your client over it.

none of that has anything to do with bootstrapping, which is about how you fund your business

For case studies, you just ask.  Their legal departments (if any) will tell you what's allowed.
