A friend of mine is coming into some money shortly and is interested in actively doing angel investing.

Assume they are investing in US, tech companies.

What would he need to start leading small angel rounds?

Both from a legal docs perspective, and other knowledge that might be taken for granted.

You don't just become an investor by having money. It's a profession. You have to be *very* experienced in building and running startups, and you have to have a decent network if you want to judge where to invest. Otherwise you'll lose all your money pretty quickly. I assume your friend wouldn't need StackExchange advice if he had network and experience. Legal docs are the last thing I would worry about here.
