I am a graphic design intern under my OPT and would like to open my own graphic design studio here in the US. So I was wondering whether I need money more than 100k or can I start with a lower amount. And will I be able to apply for a work visa for myself after opening my own studio? 

It would be appreciated if you could answer my question.

There are several issues with that: 

 1. USCIS does not like it and they will usually require a clear separation between business owner and H-1b employee. What it means is that you can't be the owner of the company that is applying for your H-1b. 
 2. USCIS will look very closely at the company that is several months (weeks?) old. Most important factor here is the ability to pay. The company will have to show how they are going to pay the salary for their H-1b employee. 
 3. ( As of Feb-4-2012 ). You have to wait until April, 1st to apply for your H-1b and even if it's approved - the effective date will be October, 1st. 

I think that overall your chances are not great, I would not recommend taking this direction.
