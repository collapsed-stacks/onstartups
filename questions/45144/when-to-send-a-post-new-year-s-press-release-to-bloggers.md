I am planning a press release campaign for my Android app starting at the beginning of January, to capture all the users that got smartphones over the holidays.

I'm debating when to send my press release to bloggers. Should I send it just before New Years so it's one of the first in their inbox (chronologically) when they return? Or should I wait a few days until they clear out the email backlog? Should I send it now?

(On a side note, is Monday still the best day to send PRs? It seems to me that it may not be the best anymore since everybody sends their PRs on that day. Is Tuesday the new Monday? Is Wednesday the new Tuesday??? ;)

Thanks in advance...

If you want people to talk about something, you need to give them time to play with it. Over the holidays may be a good time, depending on the product.

Does this "contact bloggers and they'll be your free advertising" method still work? I heard about it many years ago, but I wonder if it is still effective.
