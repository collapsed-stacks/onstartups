For crowd sourcing basically there are two main contenders, crowdspring and 99designs. I know they are both good and we can't go wrong with either one, but I am sure we can find out which one is better. What are your experience with these two? Which one would you recommend and why? I have no experience with these two, and I am very limited in budget so I would like to get people's recommendation first before deciding to choose either one.

We have had a single encounter with 99designs and did not quite like the <a href="http://99designs.com/buttons-icons/contests/set-powered-web-badges-18725">process</a> nor the <a href="http://www.excelsior-usa.com/jetbadges.html">result</a>. Went out of both time and budget. Now shopping for designers locally again.

I just had a good experience on crowdspring.com. I ended up with 600 entries for my logo design and while a lot of it is noise you get some good results there too. You just need to be prepared for the noise and you'll do fine.

We've used 99designs, making your contest private and having a good brief will help with the quality of the submissions (as will a higher listing price), as for crowdspring haven't used them yet - might give them a try next time.

I have used crowdSpring for a webpage banner. The result was ok with a loootttt of hand holding and feedback. I am now considering 99designs for website design. The problem I am having is $$ cut to either of the sites is $39 + 15%  which ends up to over $100 for a very small site. Given the fact that threshold to enter a website contest is $500, I believe the total cost outlay is NOT that lower that Agency based custom design. Am I wrong here?

<p>I haven't used any of them but I've heard good things about 99designs (for instance, I believe StackOverflow.com got their logo from there) and it seems somewhat <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/99designs.com+crowdspring.com/" rel="nofollow">more popular</a> than Crowdspring. </p>

The upside of crowdsourcing a logo is the cost and the variety of designers you can access. The downside is that the designer you use will have had little opportunity to learn about you and create a design that truly expresses your company's brand, products, and practices, and communicates to your target audience. That means you'll have *a* logo, but you won't have *your* logo.

So, with that said, go for whatever's cheaper!

I don't trust CrowdSpring.com, they seem shady and have some really large projects but then access is so limited that you don't really know what's real and what's not. 99designs is a good company and I have a good history with them for logo designs but when I tried putting a larger project through their site the results are poor. It seems crowd sourcing produces some really great ideas but often leaves you with an inexperienced designer who can't finish your project. We were forced into finishing the project with a company that charged $125 per hour!!!... but they did a good job.

I'd have to disagree that the designers don't create designs that express the company's brand. If you're a lazy contest holder this is true but if you provide feedback often and guide the designers, the results are 10 times better than a design firm.

One company that looks promising is TheFinalPrint.com. They're offering "follow-up" "post production" services. Supposedly their design and programming staff will help you finalize print and web projects. Who knows what the result will be but I've opened a contest there. I hope they're able to "finalize" the project the way they claim.

I really love this design contest concept! Anyway, I think that's enough rambling from me...

I have only had experience with 99designs, so cannot compare the two. I did however have a very good experience with 99designs, and would recommend them (and will reuse them myself).  I am not affiliated with them in any way.

I think also very relevant to your questions is how to get the most out of a contest, as no doubt you could get a good result in any contest if you make the effort.  Some tips I would give are (these are skewed towards my experience with 99designs, but I assume other sites are similar):

- Make sure your brief is as detailed and clear as possible.  The designers unfortunately do not get to read your mind, so their designs are based only on your brief. A good option is to look at other design work you like, and reference them for examples.  If the designs are not really looking how you want, you need to reevaluate and perhaps modify the brief.

- Review other contests for similar types of work, and take note of designers that you like their submissions.  Contact these designers and let them know you have a contest running, you like their work, and would appreciate if they would consider putting in an entry.

- Provide as much feedback as you can, and be as specific as possible.  Doing this throughout the contest allows the designers to iterate their designs towards something you like. The more responsive you are throughout the contest, the more responsive the designers will be.

Using the above strategies, we received many designs for our logo and are very happy with the winner.

We are using 99designs right now for crowdsourcing a redesign of a website. It seems to me that the quality of our "instructions" to the designers is the most important part of the process. "Quality" can be relative though, I guess. Hopefully, we will get several good designs to choose from. I'll report back after the contest is over.
