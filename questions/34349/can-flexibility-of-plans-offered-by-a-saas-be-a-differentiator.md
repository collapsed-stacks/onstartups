Do you feel that if a SaaS has flexibility across their offered plans, for example the ability to upgrade to the next plan but also to downgrade at any time, or maybe addons of some sort to a plan could be see as a differentiator? A bit like how web hosts offer additional bandwidth, disk space to be added on.

Some types of businesses have quieter times of the year and i imagine that being able to keep their running costs inline with their profits when their services are not being used as much would be appealing.

My question takes into account if competitors are not offering this flexibility.

Prospective clients take into consideration anything that you do differently than your competition. However, some differentiations are valuable to your target market and others are valueless. The only way to determine which is which is to talk to prospective clients and to know what they *need*. And when you find out those needs, you may also realize that they may be too expensive to implement & maintain on your end.
