What are good tips to run an alpha/beta consumer program for a web app? I want to engage the early users, test out a number of things and generate buzz. What are any tips or resources you can think of.

One company that I can think of that did a great job with their beta was Mint. Any other good references points?

<p>More than a tip, this is a resource you can use to create your beta program for your web app. There is a new company, a very cool start-up called Prefinery, I am using their services right now and it is absolutely awesome, it just works. I suggest you take a look at their website...</p>

One thing Joel mentioned a few times is that when you get a pool of testers- do not give them all the same release.  Stagger them - because once they report a bug or issue the claim is that they won't do any more.  So you treat them as a one-time use.  

I have no idea if that is accurate, but that is one suggestion.
