If you have an online solution to a particular problem and there are a number of competitors in your market, how can you design the experience in such a way that your solution will win the customer's engagement?

This is a very vague question, so it's hard to answer. However, I don't think it's enough to design the experience. 

For example, you will need to make sure that your potential customers:

 - know about your solution in the first place
 - are convinced that it provides more benefits than the competitors' solutions
 - are convinced that it's a less risky choice than other solutions (e.g. if you are just starting out, potential customers may be concerned about you going out of business, which may not be an issue for your established competitors)

I believe it's mostly about marketing and not the product. Even if your product is a lot better than the competition, if nobody knows about it, it won't go anywhere.

This should not have been voted down, its a legitimate question.  The way I would approach it is to do a design analysis on your top competitors.  Fixing their design flaws in your own product can be very smart.

Unfortunately there is not a specific design pattern I can point you to.  What i would suggest is to highly focus on the user experience in two areas:

1. Simplicity, making the application easy to learn, and easy to use.

2. Wow factor.  For a web app you can create the wow factor with a little bit of Jquery or other Javascript code.  Bandwidth has increased a lot to be able to handle this, and it really makes your app stand out.
