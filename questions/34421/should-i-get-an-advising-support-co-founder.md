I've been wanting to try my hand at my first serious start-up.
Since I can't bootstrap due to lack of funds I began to start researching incubators going as far as meeting with some of them and showing off my ideas.

Most were thrilled with them, but there was one constant "but", I didn't have a co-founder. You see I'm more of a jack of all trades in web-development (Designer, Backend/Frontend/Database Developer), so I didn't feel the need for one up until now.

I didn't really fully understand why needed one until I read that it's better to have a co-founder because of the stress that a start-up produces, but that still didn't solve the problem of me getting one. Most of my peers aren't very technical and are more school oriented. I pitched to a few of my peers alot of them said they would be onboard, but thy didn't really have anything to contribute to the start-up.

The closest person I have to a co-founder now is a marketing major who is non-technical and is mostly there for support and advisory on how to present my ideas etc, but he has no experience in a start-up and no technical skills.

My worry is that when the time comes to put him down as a co-founder if I get accepted in to an incubator, would it be wise to do so?

Based on the information you provided, it doesn't sound like you should put him down as a co-founder. Continue to look for somebody who is willing to commit fully to the project and has the skill sets you are looking for. Otherwise you may simply create more stress for yourself in the future when you have to deal with a messy break up because you merely used him as a convenient placeholder.
