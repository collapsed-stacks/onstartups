37signals develops software that's simple and gets the work done, just what the 37th verse of the Tao Te Ching describes.

Yes.  :-)

(Isn't most of Tao about simplicity, really?)

Here's a note on how 37 signals may have come up with their name:
http://37signals.com/33

Interesting coincidence on the Tao Te Ching relationship though! I wonder if the guys at 37signals knows about this. If not, you should tell them ;-)
