It would appear that there is a huge market out there for small mobile applications.  Obviously this is both good and bad.  There is a lot of potential, as well as lots of noise and competition.  What are some strategies for start-ups to get their applications noticed?

If you have a budget for marketing campaign, you can try paid options like

 1. http://www.admob.com/

Otherwise, you can try free alternative by providing a free (lite) version to users to try. Definitely, for you to market the free (lite) version you can try to promote your apps at those 'Free App A Day' website that is mentioned by Martin.

Some examples of the websites are:

 1. http://freeappaday.com/
 2. http://www.greatappaday.com/

Hope it helps.

Try to find those `Free App A Day` sites and make your application free for a while.  This will generate a little buzz, and get you some (hopefully good) reviews on your app.

One strategy can be to create a mobile version of you web site. There are some articles on Seomoz about mobile SEO. Another one is to use niche web sites for mobile applications to promote them. You strategy for get noticed shouldn't be different from strategy to get noticed with conventional application. It is just another medium. In addition to web advertising you can use other medias to promote you application (TV tech talk shows, magazines). 

It may be worth to spend some of you time to research ways to promote on facebook.
