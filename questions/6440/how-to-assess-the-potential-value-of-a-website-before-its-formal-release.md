I have developed a website and now it is under internal testing. 
What does my website do? On the one hand, if you want someone to do something for you, you can use my website, and you need to pay the person who helps you; on the other hand, you can do something for others by spending your time and you will get paid.
How to assess the potential value of my website?

<p><a href="http://www.innocentive.com/" rel="nofollow">Innocentive</a> does something like this for various fields, particularly the life sciences. Checking out the monetary "rewards" they give for completed tasks might give you an idea of how to value your services.
Amazon's Mechanical Turk does something similar for smaller scale tasks. You'll have to find a way to differentiate yourself from these big hitters. Then there's always craigslist :D</p>

The best way to assess a value of a website is with an equation that factors monthly unique visitors with an assessed value to each visitor (google analytics) Domain name is important too.  WWW.findarehab.com has a great domain name but their website gets no traffic and is very young.  Of course income and steady growth is something that certainly will affect the value of the website.  I think the best and simplest way to value a website is to find out what it earns in a fiscal year and look at it's growth in traffic and revenue and multiply it by 5.  This is for 5 years of guaranteed revenue.  For example if a website makes 1k per month in revenue and has been doing that for 2-3 years you could estimate the value of the website at around 50-60k.
