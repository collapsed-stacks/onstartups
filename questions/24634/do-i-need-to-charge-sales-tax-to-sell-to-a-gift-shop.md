I am a photographer in the Florida Keys (Monroe County) and plan to sell prints of my work in local gift shops.  I know obviously those stores will charge customers sales tax, but do I need to charge the stores themselves tax when I sell the prints to them originally?  What little I can find online says no, but I have heard from friends yes.

While you need to check the sales tax laws for the state of Florida, the general answer in the US is **no**, you don't charge a store or reseller sales tax. You **should** get a copy of their sales tax certificate or reseler certificate/number. Your invoice should reference their reseller number or cerificate, so if you ever get audited you have proof that they, not you, were responsible for sale tax.
