## How do I get answers to complex analytics questions?

I use Flurry and Mixpanel specifically to track users behavior in my apps, but the question is fundamentally solution agnostic.

What do you do to understand better the complex and interesting scenarios in your product funnel? For example: 

 - I want to know how many days pass on average before someone decides to make a purchase. 
 - I want to know what they usually do BEFORE a purchase happens. Services like Flurry are able to show you where users go after a certain action, but how about before?
 - I want to rank what the most common flows are before I make a sale so I can optimize for that.
 - Many others..

Am I entering the territory of what basic online analytics dashboards can no longer easily display and so I need to manually crunch the data I can download from these services to get to the answers I need? Am I missing some really useful functionality out there?

What do you do and what has worked well for you?
