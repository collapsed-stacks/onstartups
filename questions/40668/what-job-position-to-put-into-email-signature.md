If you have roles, then something that reflects that is fine, or "Founder" if you like. Really though, this isn't the top priority right now.

For me, I've always just my name, then the company name, for all of my businesses.

I answered this question sometime ago and it was well received:

'Founder' is a good formal title for the entrepreneur running a startup. If used when appropriate to have a title it's accurate, positive, avoids pretension, and wears well over time.
