Our startup got selected/invited to attend the fall 2011 DEMO Conference in Silicon Valley. We didn't get the free pass/scholarship. The organizers are asking for $8k to attend the conf to demo our product. We don't do social or mobile apps, is it worth it to attend this conf? 

It seems they select 50-60 startups to debut their products. Out of which probably a handful may get press coverage. We are not sure if it is worth our while to plunk $8k at this early stage? 

Anyone with a self funded startup attended this conf? What was your experience?

Thanks for any feedback.

In general, $8K (it used to be $18K) is a bit too much to pay. I launched my previous startup at TechCrunch 50, and for $0, it was an amazing deal. If we had paid $10K, it would NOT. The same applies to DEMO I believe, with all due respect to the organizers.
