I want to learn about writing surveys as a method to improve my start up website (I want to know my customer opinions) and I want to use them as a marketing tool.  I have a survey tool but I want to actually learn the best techniques, good examples etc.  

Does anyone know of any good resources, forums, groups, websites etc. that I should look at?

I recommend this pdf by surveymonkey http://s3.amazonaws.com/SurveyMonkeyFiles/SmartSurvey.pdf also checkout the blog of them and the other popular survey apps.

When i read that pdf i made notes in a notepad and then when designing my survey i constantly looked back at my notes, i found it very helpful.
