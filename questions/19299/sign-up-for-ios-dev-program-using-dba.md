I've heard some horror stories about this.  Is it really that hard to sign up for the iOS developer program and have the seller's name be your business name if you have a DBA?  I've heard many say it takes months to do it.  Am I better off signing up for the individual program?

I enrolled in the iOS developer program *twice* last year, once as a corporation and again as an individual.  The process only took a few days in both cases.  For the corporate account, Apple called me on the phone to verify.  

I read the horror stories, too, but I think most of them must have been from the program's early days.  Maybe Apple has worked out the kinks in their approval process - it went smoothly for me.

DBA's are no longer accepted by Apple unless they have reversed their earlier policy.

As a company we found it took a few weeks to get registered, though this was about a year and a half ago.

I signed up as a dba - no problem.  Probably about a year ago.  It was simple.  All I needed was the county-signed document.   They apparently accept "Business license" - and that is essentially what I got from my county when I filed for a DBA.  

Go get your DBA and find out what "business license" documents you can get from your locality - using those you can likely get the developer status.

I even used it for the hardware program - which is far more onerous and restrictive.  

The BIGGER problem is the ridiculous nonsense one has to go through to get provisioning working.  Why, Apple, Why?  Really, a 25-step process just to be able to install your own app on your own phone?  It is horrible and painful and I gave up trying.  I guess it is meant to be a barrier of sorts so that only whose who really, really want to write iPhone apps get through.
