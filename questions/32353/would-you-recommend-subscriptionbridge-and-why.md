We're looking a a recurring billing and subscription management service. I've narrowed it down to Spreedly and Subscription Bridge.  Spreedly is a bit bare bones but pretty easy to use. And they seem to have been around longer and have the kinks ironed out.

Subscription Bridge is about the same price ($50/m if we use their gateway) and has the following benefits (which spreedly does not):

* Management console for the customer
* Configurable email templates
* Reporting on Subscriptions

Since Subscription Bridge is a bit new, I've love to hear from existing customers.

<p>What about <a href="http://recurly.com/" rel="nofollow">recurly</a>?  Dunning management seems pretty solid.<br>
If you need something more complex that deals with multiple channels, consider <a href="http://www.ariasystems.com/" rel="nofollow">Aria systems</a>. </p>

Sadly, I'd have to say **I** would not, at least at this time.

Turns out Subscription bridge has some show stoppers for us (which I think they are finally changing). Like, you couldn't include a single click link to Cancel your subscription. You had to copy your ID (which is in the email) and then click a link in the email and paste the ID.).
