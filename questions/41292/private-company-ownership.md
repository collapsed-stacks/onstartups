Is it possible to find out the owners of a private Delaware c-corp? Can company records be retrieved or purchased from the state government? If not the entire list, how about a partial list (>5% owners)?

You have to contact the company itself. Delaware doesn't require the corporations it registers to report ownership, and with C-Corp it can be a lot of shareholders (which may change frequently).

IIRC Delaware doesn't require reporting any ownership information at all, and doesn't even require reporting the principles.
