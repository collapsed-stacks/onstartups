I have an account in Elance. The money i have earned, directly transferred to my bank account [India]. My question is, the money i earned, are they already tax deducted or do i have to pay tax differently. Sorry for this silly question but i am completely clueless about this tax stuffs.

Any help will be appreciated.

Regards

<p>Did you get any confirmation that the tax had been withheld? If not - it had not.</p>

<p>In the US Elance <a href="http://help.elance.com/forums/30972/entries/34202" rel="nofollow">will help payers with issuing 1099's to the freelancers</a>. But nowhere do they mention tax withholding <a href="http://help.elance.com/entries/34209-How-Do-I-Fill-Out-a-W-9-Tax-Form-" rel="nofollow">neither for US nor for foreign</a> payees. Where did you come up with the idea that they do?</p>
