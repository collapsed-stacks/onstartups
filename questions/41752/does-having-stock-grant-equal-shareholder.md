Legally speaking, if a person has been issued a stock grant does it automatically make that person a shareholder?

Or does he need to be given a stock certificate?

What about options?

Stock grants are stock. If company does not certificate (and most don't, since paper shares are pain to deal with), your name, number of shares, and their class is entered into the journal. Options are just that, your option to purchase stock at certain price. Until you purchase the shares, you have no ownership in the company.
