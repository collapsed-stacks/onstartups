Recently I'm thinking to partner with someone in US and work on ideas turning into potential businesses. I'm a developer and based out of India. I'd like to work for equity but â€“ I don't know whether or not it is possible to be a partner in a US corporation staying abroad. What key pointers do I need to look at before considering establishing such relationships?

Not a problem. You can own as much stock as you want in US companies, without ever setting foot in the US. Problems start when you move to the US and want to work: then you need a work permit (visa), which can be very hard to get. But as long as your work is done outside the US, you're clear.
