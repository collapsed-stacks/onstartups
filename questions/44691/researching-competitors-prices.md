I am starting a company and don't have any major competitors other than one company (who has a similar product and a huge market-share). Sadly this company doesn't sell its product online, you have to have a business that needs the service and request a quote. How can I find the other companies' pricing out, because requesting a quote under my company wont work?

I agree with @Karlson, call the sales number for the company you are curious about. If they don't have prices they give out because it varies by project ask for a low to high range or ask what typical projects cost.

Taylor, It helps to know their pricing as you can utilize this in your marketing. Not in setting the price of your offering. What I mean by this is. if you know your pricing is more then theirs. Then the way you pitch it shows the value of the higher cost. "They're cheaper because they do X. We do X, Y and Z and we do it this much faster, better etc. That's why we cost more." You could go with the cheaper solution, but would you really want to? People will pay for your product what they think it's worth. Tell them what it's worth and WHY they should buy it from you and you'll be good to go.

If your big competitor is publicly listed then you might be able to get an idea of their pricing from their annual reports. Their annual report will usually be available on their website and/or through the stock exchange where they are listed. Their annual report might tell you how many customers they have, and a breakdown of their revenue, and you could do some rough math to figure out how much each customer is paying.

I would suggest that you shouldn't do this. Sell your product based on the value it delivers and what customers are willing to pay - not on what your competition is selling at.
