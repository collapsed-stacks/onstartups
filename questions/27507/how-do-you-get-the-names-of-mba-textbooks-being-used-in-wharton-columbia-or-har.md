Ivy league colleges do provide their specific curriculum, but they don't give out the textbooks names, how do you get them ? 

So far I have been able to find wharton 2005-06 books list on amazon listmania, but I'm looking for the latest ones

Why would you even care?

I suppose if you must know, you could email the schools and ask. It isn't secret, so there shouldn't be an issue.

If you look up the course you're interested in, you can always find the professor's name and email. Just email and ask for the ones you're interested in. I assume they won't mind sharing the information.

You could find it on the web easily, but from everyone I know who's going to Columbia or Harvard for an MBA, it's probably not worth it. The point is the credential and the networking, not the coursework. As they say, those who can do, and those who can't teach.

You might want to read "The Creature From Jekyll Island" for an interesting perspective on finance and banking.
