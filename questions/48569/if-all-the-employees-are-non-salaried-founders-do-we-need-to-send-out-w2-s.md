We founded a C-Corp in fall 2012. None of us are taking a salary and there are no salaried employees. Do we need to send out W2's?

The instructions, straight from the IRS, state the following (http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw2w3.pdf):

> Who must file Form W-2. Every employer engaged in a  trade or business
> who pays remuneration, including  noncash payments of **$600 or more for
> the year** (all  amounts if any income, social security, or Medicare tax
> was withheld) for services performed by an employee  must file a Form
> W-2 for each employee (even if the  employee is related to the
> employer) from whom: Income, social security, or Medicare tax was
> withheld. Income tax would have been withheld if the employee  had
> claimed no more than one withholding allowance or  had not claimed
> exemption from withholding on Form  W-4, Employee's Withholding
> Allowance Certificate. Unless otherwise noted, references to Medicare
> tax  include Additional Medicare Tax. If you are required to file 250

The more appropriate question is "should we be talking salary". Generally you must pay yourself a *reasonable* salary, at least if the company is making money. In case of C-Corp, the IRS might expect reasonable salary for officers even if there are losses, since C-Corp can accumulate those. You should discuss it with a CPA, but you might get nailed by the IRS for not drawing salary.
