<p>If we have more than one owners in an LLC<sup>1</sup> with no other employees I am unsure or confused about how much each owner can contribute. I was unable to find a definitive answer after searching for a few hours.</p>

<p><strong>Can each owner contribute different amounts as the employer contribution to the 401K?</strong></p>

<p>Example<sup>2</sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Owner 1 contributes $1000 (employee) and $0 (employer)</li>
<li>Owner 2 contributes $17500 (employee) and $10000 (employer)</li>
<li>Owner 3 contributes $17500 (employee) and $30000 (employer)</li>
</ul>

<p>I ask as we are looking into setting up an <em>Owner-Only 401(k)</em> for our business, but one of our owners doesn't want to contribute any money.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> assume each owner gets $150K in wage compensation to cover 25% contribution limits</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> the LLC is treated as an S-Corp for tax purposes, but I believe that is irrelevant</p>

<p>I'd suggest you talking to an EA/CPA or a tax attorney specializing on retirement plan issues for a proper consultation.</p>

<hr>

<p>You cannot have different employer contribution rules for different employees, that would disqualify your 401k plan entirely. One of the conditions for the 401(k) classification is non-discrimination (401(k)3). To avoid the claim of discrimination, you must have the allowed employee contribution either the same, or in the same proportion to the compensation.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401" rel="nofollow">26 USC § 401(a).5.B</a> in particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(B) Contributions and benefits may bear uniform relationship to
  compensation.— A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within
  the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or
  benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan bear a
  uniform relationship to the compensation (within the meaning of
  section 414(s)) of such employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for the employees that contribute the same to the plan - the employer's match should be the same. You cannot have employee X contributing $17500 but receiving $10000 match while employee Y contributes the same $17500 and receives $30000 match. That would disqualify your entire plan.</p>

<p>There's also an issue of favouring high earners that you need to keep in mind if you have other employees (sec 401(k)5 and 401(k)3.A.2).</p>

<p>However, if one of the owners doesn't want to contribute money, you're allowed not to match as well, since it is within the scope of the <em>elective</em> deferral (see sec. 401(k)).</p>

<p>You need to remember, that for owners you can only contribute to the plan from <em>owners'</em> compensation (see sec. 401(d)).</p>
