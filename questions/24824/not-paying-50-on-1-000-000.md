Hypothetically speaking, if someone earns £1,000,000 "profit" in 1 year who is British via his own company, is it possible to NOT pay 50% tax on that legally?  Is it possible to reduce that 50% to a lower figure legally?

50% is the top rate of personal income tax. It is paid only on income over the applicable threshold.

If your company earned those profits, you will also be paying corporation tax, and probably VAT. There are ways to reduce the amount of corporation tax, and if you retain the profits in the business, you may be able to convert your realisation to a capital receipt, which will be taxed as a capital gain, likely at a lower rate than taking it as income.

Speak to an actual tax lawyer or accountant. Not a cheap one, or a scheme-monger, either. If you don't, you will probably end up paying more than 50%.

There is a lot of tricks to lower legally the amount of taxes you have to pay at the end of the year as an entrepreneur. I am not sure this is the goal of the site to speak about that, and depending on your country things may vary, so you should consult a tax expert.

Basically you can lower the amount you have to pay by making the company to pay for a lot of expenses (phone, internet access, car for instance). You can also buy on your own (through a specific kind of holding) some real estate, then you can rent the real estate to the company (in some countries the taxes are not the same for real estate earnings than for classical earnings). The idea is to take a loan for buying an office space, then to rent it to the company. Since you have a loan to reimburse, you won't pay taxes on the money you earn by renting the office space to the company.
Once the loan is finished, you just move to another building with the same trick. But again, ask to an expert since can be different in your country.

Yes there is a definite way to lower the tax you're paying. Depending on your corporate structure, it would involve branching off to another country. It is legal, but you should consult a professional tax lawyer on the matter as I am not to familiar with EU tax laws. I paid mine about $180,000 to set up my tax shelter, which was half of what I saved by him doing so (that was our contract). I wouldn't see someone who charges less than 100k and under the age of 60 for their services, however.
