And what are the differences between them.
Which one pays most?
Which one is bigger?

I made a little game and we are considering to simply give it away for free and get funded by ads. We're considering our options.

Apple uses iAds though depending on which country you're serving the ads in, the fill rate may be low. I would definitely recommend using iAds as your primary iPhone app ad provider and use Google AdMob as a secondary one.
