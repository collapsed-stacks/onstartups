I'm fixing to register as an iPhone developer and making the decision of registering as an individual or business. I will be the sole developer with maybe contracting someone to do some graphic design. The only reason I can see registering as a business would be for branding. Your thoughts?

In most cases, you'll want to register as a business.  This allows you to start building a central brand (under which you can register multiple applications). 

It's also possible that some of your apps have a website associated with them too.  This should be the business brand.

In short, it's never too early to start building your brand.

I can see some downsides to registering as a developer but not for registering as a business.  If the apps take off and you want to sell the business some day, you don't want to have to rebrand.  On the other hand, if something goes terribly wrong, you don't want it linked too closely to your personal brand (which is difficult to change).  Even if your goal is to impress prospective employers with your skills, it's easy enough to show that you and the business are one and the same. Bottom line: registering as a business gives you a lot more flexibility.

You'll want a business, ideally a LLC or C corp. Branding, marketing, asset protection from when you step onto some registered trademark by accident and the corporation comes in blazing with a law suit and wants to take your house away and personal assets due to damages, and you have no asset protection since your a individual.. 

Always go with the corporation.

Register as a business, and in addition, setup an LLC or other business form to sell the apps under.  This way you can deduct some expenses.  Did you have to buy a Mac, an iPhone, the developer program fee, etc.?

I'd recommend registering as a business and then using sites such as taskcity for finding jobs as an individual. The site allows you to create a profile and build a "brand" for yourself or your business. It also allows you to build credit with others as you bid/win new jobs they will show up on your profile. Since this is through a 3rd party, your brand will be increasingly credible as you continue to win bids on work. 

I'd recommend the business aspect in order to protect yourself as well as the fiscal benefits of taxation. 

Good Luck
