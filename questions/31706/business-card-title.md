I've started as a freelancer and back then I got a friend to design me two business cards that I handle in different situations.
Bellow my name I have:

 - IT Consultant, the generic card that I handle in the "generic" situation.
 - Dat Migration Expert, my expertise, which I handle for specific data migration/system integration situations.

My situation has changed and now I have a very good team working with me, but I'm the only one that call the shots.
Some days ago I met an old friend, he was abroad for almost 10 years, and when I handle him a card, he stated:

"*You should really put something in it that states that you call the shots*"

He got me thinking and I believe he's right. 
I'm the guy that does everything - business development, sales, accouting, etc. -, i.e., I'm the C*O guy... 
The word "owner" is out of the question, "partner" does not apply and "CEO" is not quite true...

The best I came with was "founder".
Is this the best title for a guy that has it's own business and it's alone on it?

Using founder says you are a start up.  Good or Bad, this can make some people you are dealing with see you as small, not serious, and the like.  I am not saying that is the right impression to have, but some will have it.  CEO, CTO, President, etc... says authority and implies that you have structure.  I think CEO or President would be a better choice for you.

I like "founder", it doesn't seem out of place for a small company, and doesn't come across as an ego title.

I am not sure if there are local differences, but in Australia it is common to see "Director" and "Managing Director" as well.

Personally I use founder if I need a title, but even better for me is no title at all. No title gives you the most versatility.

<p>I like founder as it is accurate, unpretentious, and wears well over time.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d suggest seeing <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/2090/whats-your-title-in-your-little-startup/2108#2108">this prior question on titles</a>. There's lots of discussion and some great answers.</p>

In the UK 'Director' or 'IT Director' is a good option if your start-up is a Limited company.  It is both accurate and says that you are jn charge.

Director is also suitably vague for most situations and, in my opinion, not too pretentious.
