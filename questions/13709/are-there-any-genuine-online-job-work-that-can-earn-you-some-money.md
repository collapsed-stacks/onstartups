This may be a vague question but i was always wondering this, of course i am not talking about spamming nor things like that but about genuine and reliable online job/work that can be done from your home.

I am not looking for an specific field of work but instead i would like to know widely what options are there (and average earning if possible) and things like that  **and of course i would like to hear more about International options and not the ones that tied you down to loations for example "this city only" or "this town only"** ...

I am aware of some option i will be formating it and posting later today but i would like to hear more about everyone's point of view about this.

Aswell what should be your main concerns when accepting this sort of job/work ?

I hoping this to have a great contribution of everyone so i will mark it as community wiki.

There's an AskReddit thread that has quite a list:

My go-to recommendations are http://www.textbroker.com and http://www.mechanicalturk.com
