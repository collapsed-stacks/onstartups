I would like to know what are the criteria and formalities required to register your company with STPI. Can anyone share their experience of the process and/or point me to some useful resources in this regard.

<p>I do not see much advantage in registering with STPI. However, The process is tedious and plenty of paperwork is involved in getting it done.  </p>

<p>Depending on which part of the country you are in, Norms could be slightly different. This <a href="http://www.hyd.stpi.in/cguide/guide.html" rel="nofollow">Link</a> is for hyderabad.  </p>

<p>It costs something around 10 k If you are a startup. Also, Note that once registered you'll need to get prior permission from STPI to serve with in India.  </p>

<p>am curious why would you want to register with STPI ?</p>

I registered my firm with STPI (Hyderabad). A registration with them certainly gives you a few tax incentives and other minor fringe benefits. If that is worth it for you go ahead and register. As mentioned before, the process is riddled with tedious paperwork and bureaucracy.
