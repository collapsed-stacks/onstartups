We got an idea to realize internet service that will give small\middle companies an opportunity to export goods to other countries (first of all to Russia). Analog of alibaba.com, but with real help in export (transport, logistic, bargaining & correspondence without language barrier etc.).

Are small firms interested in such service, what do you think?

I'm confused. Alibaba.com does the opposite of what you propose. Alibaba helps Chinese manufacturers export goods to me. I use it. You can search there for products and ask for quotes. It does not help me export goods to China. I don't see this as a model for your business, unless you are targetting your business to Russians.

If you want to help businesses target the Russian market, you have a lot of competition. Virtually every state in the US has some kind of international program to help their businesses sell things to other countries. My state (Illinois) offers partially sponsored booths at all major international trade shows, and has a whole department designed to help Illinois business export their products. If I have an export question I'm going to call them. They are free and experts in the field.

It may be better to show small/medium size businesses what people in Russia want. You may not narrow it down to a specific brand, but for types of products. If you can solve the logistical problems, why wouldn't they?
