I hope to start working with a developer that has a database app that we can customize for niche clients. 

My duties will include actual face to face sales, marketing, UX design improvement, and technical support for content (since I speak the language, medicine, and he doesn't). Th developer already has his own LLC with other successful apps, which I don't care to be part of. I only care about the one. 

What would be a good way to structure this relationship? My duties and responsibilities go beyond "consultant."
