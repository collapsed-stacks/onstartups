You need to assign the copyright to your company. The only costs would be the cost of having the assignment contract drafted. After that you would most likely want to have the assignment recorded with the copyright office. This costs $105.00.

To assign transfer copyright to your company you can use an copyrigh transfer service or employ the services of an IP attorney who can handle the paperwork for you.  We had the exact same issue ourselves, and created Kunvay to scratch our own itch and help others do the same.
