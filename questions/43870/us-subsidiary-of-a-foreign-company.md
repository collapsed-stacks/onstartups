I'm setting up a US sub of a foreign company to market apps and we decided that the best way to go was to incorporate because of liability, fund-raising and other issues rather then a LLC or Partnership.  We're going to incorporate in California so will there be any unitary tax consequence and issues with having the owner be the parent company?  Thanks in advance.

Yes, there might be. I suggest getting a proper legal and tax advice from a competent person in that area. If there's no particular reason to incorporate in CA, I suggest it would probably be better for you to incorporate in another state.
