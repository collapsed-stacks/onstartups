<p>Everyone has a very strong idea, which is why so few of the networks go on to be truly profitable.</p>

<p>You may want to start with finding someone with a strong tech background, as that person may know how to reach out to find other developers.</p>

<p>Then, you should probably have a prototype before you approach investors, as it will be important to show what differentiates your idea from the thousands of other social networking sites, and why yours may be successful, and that you can pull it off.</p>

<p>The investors will be looking at whether they believe you can do it, and if you are really passionate about your idea, I believe.</p>

<p>You could go there without a prototype but, the farther along you are the easier it will be to get some funding.</p>

<p>You may want to look at the idea of Customer Development, you can read through various posts on that on this site:
