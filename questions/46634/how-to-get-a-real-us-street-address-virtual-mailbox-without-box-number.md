CMRA stands for a Commercial Mail Receiving Agency.

See example:
http://freshdesk.com/about<br>
Freshdesk, Inc.<br>
340 S Lemon Ave #7585<br>
Los Angeles, CA, 91789, USA

The #7585 in the address is the dead giveaway they are using a CMRA. A real street address is really easy to get in nearly any other part of the world except the US. Any solution for that?

<p>Getting a street address in the US is easy. Both UPS and USPS offer that service. See <a href="http://www.theupsstore.com/products-services/mailbox/Pages/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://faq.usps.com/eCustomer/iq/usps/request.do?create=kb%3aUSPSFAQ&amp;view%28%29=c%5Bc_uspsjch02132012%5D&amp;varset%28source%29=sourceType%3aembedded#street" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of replacing #box with something so that it's not obvious it's a P.O. Box, you can use "suite". So using your example:</p>

<p>Freshdesk, Inc. <br>
340 S Lemon Ave, suite 7585<br>
Los Angeles, CA, 91789, USA</p>

<p>I don't think they officially support the use of the word suite, but depending on your needs it may be good enough.</p>

<p>Of course if someone uses Google Maps to find your address, it'll be obvious it's a P.O. Box.</p>

<p>Adding an additional point, If you want to bypass the Google Maps / PO box issue that Zuly mentioned, you can sign up with a shared office space company - mail / packages can be received &amp; forwarded as needed.  <a href="http://www.regus.com/starting-a-business/business-services/business-address.aspx" rel="nofollow">Here's a example</a> of a company that offers such services worldwide - there are others. </p>

Are you looking for a street address **without** a suite or apartment number? Those are assigned to a physical piece of property in the US.

If suite numbers are acceptable *(which vast numbers of US businesses use)* consider the Merchandise Mart in Chicago. The building is so large that it has its own zip code. It has suites numbered in the thousands. So what is wrong with a large suite number?

There are plenty of mail holding and forwarding services that offer boxes with numbers from 1 - 1,000. You can refer to them as box, suite, apt, or whatever.
