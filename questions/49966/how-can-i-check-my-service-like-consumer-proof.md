I have a prototype - educational web service and I just want to get some real users - would they use it, their feedback and so on.

And I just don't know, where I can get them. At the moment site is at free hosting, nothing is invested in advertising. Of course, before spending some money on it, I want to estimate probability, with which this whole story will work out and return me at least what I invested.

What can I do?

Friends is not an option. NO, I have friends (ha-ha), but it is interest conflict - interest of my friend and interest of consumer. They probably will say it's cool just not to offend me. I want real consumer-proof.

Find an educational institution that would benefit from the educational value of your website and ask them to try for free participation in a pilot project.

Make a deal with them that if the project becomes successful that they'll get more value out of it due to helping you with their existing user base to test out the site.

And implement a way for the users to provide feedback to you from the site (you may have that already).

Should your site not fall into any of the traditional educational categories you can always place an ad in the paper (nothing fancy) letting people know of the site.

Let the users know the site is in beta and that any feedback is welcome.

Hope this helps.
