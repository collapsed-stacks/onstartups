I have a press release ready for the launch of my company, and a large media list from a commercial media list source going to reporters and bloggers who cover my industry. What is the best way to send out a bulk email like this? Do I use Aweber, or do a manual mail merge? I'm using Mac OS X with MS Entourage for mail.

I have been doing PR for a number of years and I'm not a big fan of the mass email approach.  A lot of journalists consider it spam.  Not good, especially when one of your goals is to create good releationships with journos. 

I would recommend this stragy -- send the news release out over a PAID newswire (I think with newswires you get what you pay for). It will get pushed to newsites (good for SEO) and to the media who get newswire feeds. Then cherry pick from that media list you purchased.  What blogs/pubs are most likely to cover the announcement? Which pubs/sites are most likely read by your prospects, customers? What pubs/sites/blogs are you most familiar with? 

Then write a thoughtful (not too long) "pitch" that shows you know the pub/site and are a good source. 

Make sure the press release is optimized with keywords and links. Post on your site and email to customers and prospects with a friendly note. BTW, try to release your news Mon thru early Thurs. and avoid the first day back from a holiday. 

Good luck!
