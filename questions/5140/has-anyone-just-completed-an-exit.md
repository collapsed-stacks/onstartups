My friend and I have recently finalized the sale of our company. Our goal now is to try and meet up with a group of two or three founders, people in a situation similar to ours, who have have worked together and founded a successful startup in the past. It's our hope to work together on a new startup. There's more info at http://www.igeejo.com.

That sounds artificial. The only common thing you are looking for is "successful exit" experience... I am afraid that's not enough.
