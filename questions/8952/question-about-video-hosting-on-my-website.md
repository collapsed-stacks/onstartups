## Question about video hosting on my website

Few questions for the experts. I want to add a section to my sporting related web site that will be composed of user generated videos. Specifically I want my users to have the capacity to upload videos directly to my site (actually via my site to a third party hosting service). At which point there will need to be some sort of programic approval process before they are made available. In addition I would like my users to have the capacity to search all uploaded videos from my site. Commenting would be cool too.

I'm thinking the best way to do this is to have the videos hosted by a third party service. When users query for videos from my site I assume the query would be directed at the hosting services Database? Or could that be local? I would like the fact that the videos are being hosted elsewhere to be invisible to the user. These videos would be at the most 10 minutes in length.

Can any of you experts recommend a third party service that can provide this service that is not super expensive?

Thanks.

what you describe is possible using the Viddler api-- got a few folks with the same workflow of user upload-> approval.  You can query for videos based on a tag and generate appropriate embed codes.  http://developers.viddler.com/  Pricing starts at $100/month @ http://b2b.viddler.com/  -- full disclosure: I work there.
