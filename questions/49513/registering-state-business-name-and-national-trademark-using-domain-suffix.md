I've decided to register my business name at the Texas SOS. I am considering registering the business as the actual web domain + domain suffix as follows:

> Entity for name to be reserved: "mywebsite.com"

Has anyone done this? Is this a good idea? Also, would adding a `.com` to the entity name differentiate it from a business name `mywebsite` or would this not be sufficient for differentiation?

Also, if `mywebsite.com` is sufficient for differentiation, etc, would there be any point in registering the federal trademark? I am assuming that there would be no point given that no one else would try to register a trademark for a website name that I own?

Thanks
