I am looking for a free and preferably open source system to deal with order processing and stock/inventory control, that can integrate into amazon, ebay, and our own website sales. 

At the moment there is no system in place, and it is hell to administer.

We have looked at Linnworks and a few other systems, but are VERY expensive. 

Is there anything available or am I dreaming?!
