I am adding a Sales and Marketing co-founder for my start up. The product is already developed and we have 3 unpaid customers so far (Private Beta). My co-founder will work full time on this venture to get customers and do online marketing as well. He is ready to work on a vested equity for an year or two. I would like to start with X% of incremental equity tied to his performance. 

My question is how much and what basis I should offer him equity?

Additional information:
1. I spent more than 9 months to develop this product, including product conceptualization, customer development and Beta testing
2. I spent more than  $20 K out of my own pocket
3. I will continue to spend 20 hours per week to support the technical and operations side of the business
4. My co founder will spend 40 hours a week.

Since this is mostly a sales position, my advise is to offer a small amount of stock (5% - 10% vesting over a few years) and a major commission split. Anywhere from 30% to 50%.

I recommend against trying to have more specific milestones linked to performance in the stock vesting. It never works in practice.

Either he starts selling and his stock is vesting happily, or he is not able to sell anything.
