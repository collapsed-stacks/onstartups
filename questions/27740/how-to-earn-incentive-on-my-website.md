I have a website named Digital Flicks and its a website on most of the Web technology updates. Now the problem I have is that I want to monetize the website soon. I want to know some Ad Publishing network other that Adsence which can help me to earn.

I have tried Google Adsence but it most of the time says that my site does not comply with the policies of Google.I don't know what it is. My traffic varies from 150-200 visits/day so it is approximately 3000-6000 visits per month. I think its fare enough.

Please suggest some good ways in which I can monetize. I live in India. Hope my location can be useful to solve my problem too.

I'd recommend looking a sponsors for the site utilizing a framework like Openx: http://www.openx.org/  This will allow you get a better return on the advertising along with still being able to give advertisers metrics

Take a look at www.cj.com (Commission Junction) - I know some people that make good money using links from CJ that give them affiliate / commission money versus just ad clicks.
