What are the "high traffic" RSS feeds or firehoses that you read? Are you satisfied? Which one is  most valuable to you? 

Hacker news - too much gossip, code tips, product announcements
http://news.ycombinator.com/newest

Slashdot - ubergeek, too much traffic
http://slashdot.org/firehose.pl



I want: 

more real entrepreneurs, less VC & marketing

more how to build business, less code tips

more small companies, less big company news (Google, Apple)

more interviews & real persons, less "TOP 10 ways how to ..."

"more how to build business"... what about this great new site called answers.onstartups.com? :)

Magazines (as antiquated as they are can be a great source): Inc., Entrepreneur, Business Week, and Fast Company often have great stories and interviews on small companies

I hear you about "more interviews, real persons, less "Top 10 ways how to..."
