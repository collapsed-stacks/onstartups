<p>This is for my university research task. 
What do you think will be the most successful software product (not service) in the Indian software industry? 
And how will that product be customised to suit the needs of the Indian audience.</p>

<p>Antivirus or any other scareware. A terrorist threat meter application for example. Do it with a Client-/Server architecture for an enterprise solution that deploys the current state of terrorist threat around all clients in the network. Give away the client solution free-of-charge and charge for the enterprise edition.</p>

<p>We are all scared and going through hard times of terror and threats. Everywhere. Bush told us so. </p>

<p>For indians in particular, make a bollywood schmalzometer that counts the colors and tears in a movie. Also make a enterprise version for those who want to inform their employees about the latest schmalzomax.</p>

<p>I think what you mean to ask is "What software product would generate maximum demand in Indian Markets". </p>

<p>I would say a CRM - Customer Relationship Management product</p>

<p>Also, considering the Indian IT infrastructure,the following customization will work the best - Minimum dependence on Internet
- Desktop Applications 
- Applications which work on basic handsets (no smartphones or tablets)
- Do not require major business process changes.</p>

<p>This is most applicable to SME markets, but more or less the same even for big players in India.</p>
