## LLC, single person, internet-only business: what state am I "doing business" in if I'm perma-travelling?

I have a question similar to [this one](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/9609/delaware-llc-one-person-internet-only-business-do-i-need-to-register-as-a-for), with one difference: I'm going to be running my business while travelling the world over the next few years, both in the US and out. (I'm a resident of California.) What does "doing business" count as in that case? Do I still have to pay taxes in California, or am I free to register in any one state? (Or do I have to register in multiple states, depending on where I'm working at the time?!)

<p>As I explained on my blog in <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/04/04/when-doing-business-isnt-doing-business/" rel="nofollow">When “Doing Business” isn’t “Doing Business”</a>, it is important to understand the different meanings of "doing business":</p>

<ul>
<li>The other OnStartups question to which you referred (which I answered) discussed "doing business" from the perspective of the state(s) in which an entity must or should register as a domestic or foreign (out-of-state) entity. That is one where a lawyer can be helpful.</li>
<li>Your question appears to be oriented toward "doing business" as a determinant of where taxes must be paid. That is one where a tax adviser who is familiar with multi-state tax issues can provide the right answers.</li>
</ul>
