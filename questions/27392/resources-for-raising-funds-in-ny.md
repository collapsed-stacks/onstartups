I need to start fund raising so I can hire developers to finish completion of my product and start selling it and actually making some money.

At the moment I have a presentation and a partly functioning prototype I can demonstrate, but I can't really go further by myself.

I don't have family or friends I can ask, and as I have always worked for myself don't have  co-workers I can partner with. There is absolutely no one in my personal circle I can ask to contribute in any way.

I was looking at Angels and VCs and such, however they all seem to want to invest only in existing companies. Most of them don't even have a means to setup a meeting or give a demonstration.

If Angels and VCs are out....what else can I do? Should I start advertising? How can I get people to actually give me money so I can bring my project to fruition?

<p>It sounds like a seed fund or incubator might be a good fit for you. A seed fund will give you a small amount of money (around $25K - $50K) to help you advance your business. They often help out with contacts and strategic direction. Many of them also have links to VCs and Angels and can help you with further funding when (and if) you are ready for it.</p>

<p>Some of the appropriate funds in NY are:</p>

<ul>
<li>TechStars</li>
<li>Village Ventures </li>
<li>Iridesco Ventures    </li>
<li>Union Square Ventures</li>
</ul>

<p>Public or not for profit seed funds include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Small Business Technology Investment Fund (SBTIF)    </li>
<li>WNY Business Development Fund    </li>
<li>NYC Seed </li>
<li>Excell Partners, Inc.    </li>
</ul>

<p>You could also consider applying to interstate programs like Y Combinator. There is a list of the top incubator programs in the US <a href="http://www.pollenizer.com/top-incubators-in-the-us/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>(For those not in NY, there is a list of incubators worldwide <a href="http://startupweekend.org/incubators/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)</p>
