Is there a video conference app(preferably an iPad app) that would allow two people to view the same screen. For example, revising a slide or browsing while chatting and collaborating.

Ivisit do it for PC's but they don't have an app.

Are there any other options? Suggestions appreciated.

There are a lot of those around, other than the leaders in the web conferencing market (WebEx and GoToMeeting); the first that pop in my mind are CrunchConnect.com, YuuGuu.com or Join.me. A free one is http://www.meetingburner.com/.

I don't know any with an iPad app.

<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.mikogo.com/" rel="nofollow">Mikogo</a> lately.  I like it because it is free and the presenter is the only one who has to install something - participants just go to a web site and enter the meeting id.  I don't think the presenter app is supported on the ipad but the online viewer might be since nothing needs to be installed and flash is not required.</p>
