You hire an employee when that person will bring in more money than they cost.

Bringing in money includes saving others time so that they can be more productive.

The costs include any risk or liability that would be associated with the employee, overhead in terms of equipment they'll require, and any administrative work that is now required (e.g. HR and managerial work).

The strategic goal of increasing employee -- is a significant growth goal. 

And growth has consequences. Some of these are good. Some might not be.  It will depend on you, what you like and what gives you satisfaction. There are many good reasons to say "no" and never bring on additional employees. 

When our consulting team facilitating a strategic growth initiative we spend considerable time with the organizational leadership ensuring they really want to growth. There is a strong assumption in our business culture that if you aren't growing you are dieing. I disagree. I think that there are many tremendous reasons to find a sustainable level of business activity that matches your skills, your market, and what provides you satisfaction. 

Do you enjoy managing? Do you enjoy supporting, encouraging, disciplining? Or would you rather be doing the baking, programming, speaking, building that is your business? Would you rather that increased opportunities bring the ability to be more selective? Or would you like these increased opportunities to be captured to pay for increased overhead? Do you crave the regular contact with customers- - is that what keeps you sharp and feeds your soul? Will new employees bring you closer to your customer or separate you farther from them? 

There are lots of calculators for projecting employee ROI -- but don't forget the intangibles which are at the core of why you made the choice to be in business in the first place!

If you are the typical owner/operator you are wearing many hats every day.  If you can crawl out from under a few of those hats you'll have more time to do the things that you are good at and the things that bring in the most money.  

Thus, in my opinion, during the early stages, you should either hire people to (A) do the things you are not good at, OR (B) do the things that are easy but not worth your time.

This way you have more time for the important money making things.

Good luck.

Do not think of your employee as a "helping hand". You're a business owner. Since you're running a small business, besides being a developer, you need to find new clients, keep current clients and do some administrative overhead which can be significant varying on country and time of the year.

If you expending more time doing those other tasks would allow to make money enough to pay an employee (plus overhead and taxes), then take a (new) employee.

you might consider hiring an employee to increase your business. so take some time to consider both sides of the hiring reasons.

for example
More work can get done by a team.
team can extend the range of skills and idea in your small business.
Increased work time hours
A sense of teamwork and cooperation 
smart players can overcome any obstetricals
 
but some time 
Training and supervising each employee adds time to your schedule
Additional expense of salary, 

so it's depend on your company type and atmosphere you should know your pros.
