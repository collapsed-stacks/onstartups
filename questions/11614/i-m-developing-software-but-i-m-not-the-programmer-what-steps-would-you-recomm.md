I have an idea for an app, but I have no background in programming.  How would you recommend I select my programmer, and what steps should I take along the way to protect the IP?  At this point, all I can say is the end app will run on android and flash and be web tv based.

<p>Well, for a strong what-<strong>not</strong>-to-do and some to-do's, you could read through this <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.823632.52" rel="nofollow">recent thread at the BoS forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>For smaller projects (a couple of man-months of development time) I would suggest:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Asking for references for your developer, and actually calling these references to hear their story. A reasonably thorough background check on the developer before engaging with him.</li>
<li>A <strong>clear contract with the developer</strong> (employment contract / project contract) and a <strong>level-headed Non-Disclosure Agreement</strong> with the developer. Both of these documents should be reviewed by your lawyer.</li>
<li>A source code repository under <strong>your control</strong>, with daily checkins of the complete code branch by your developer. If that's not possible (it should be), then escrow of the source+binaries for all milestone deliveries is the next best solution.</li>
<li>A clear copyright assignment text in the header of all source code files, i.e. clearly identifying your company as the copyright holder.</li>
</ul>

It depends on how innovative your idea is. Unfortunately there is really little you can do to protect your IP, as, once you get it on the Android, someone can decompile it, and you will need a programmer to implement it, so they will know what to do, but, if you pay the programmer then it is a work for hire which will help protect against him taking the program for himself.

I personally have problems with software patents and copyrights only go so far to protect, as it can be hard to prove violations, and expensive.

You can have the android app obfuscated, and that will provide some protection, but ultimately there is only so much you can do.

Do a search for Android developers and work within the proximity you need to have a professional relationship (do you need face to face or can you do remotely?). 

You'll either have to pay them in cash/salary or offer equity. Not everyone is going to want the equity route, so you can eliminate them quickly. 

Without any code how much IP do you really have? You can try to get them to sign some sort of agreement. You may want a lawyer for that one.

Well, you should prepare a NDA form for your dev to sign. That's pretty standard.

Keep this in mind: it's true that once the app is on the marketplace, pretty much any developer can decompile it, but that will happen only if your app gets famous and well-known and it's complex enough that is not easy to reproduce without looking at the original source code (which I doubt, on a general basis).

I'm not trying to discourage you, but the thing that will most probably happen (I'm talking out of experience) is that by the time your app is completed and available in the store, there will be two or three competitors already, possibly with lower prices (or even free). The mobile app market changes at a crazy rate, so be very careful.
