I'm trying to get started with my business idea, but I'm looking for at least one partner. I've found one, who I know vaguely, but he wants his brother in too.

Although both seem competent enough, I'm a bit reluctant to work in a three way split scenario with two relatives possibly teaming up against me. It is a worst case scenario of course, goal is to get the business running, not to fight.

How do you feel about such a scenario?

The only thing worse than a friend for a partner is a relative. I was warned against it and ignored the advice. I paid dearly. I would never do it again.

You should be evaluating each partner on their own merits. It's great if your partner can find you another who is worthy, but you should determine on your own whether or not you want the third wheel.

This should also be a warning to you about working with this partner. You have not yet committed to him, and he's making possibly unreasonable demands of the business. 

In regard to control, you don't have to split the company equally between the partners. It's your company alone initially, and then you make an offer to the partner. You can offer 10%. Or 50%. Or 90%. It's up to you to make the offer, and up to your potential partner to decide whether or not to accept it.

Proceed carefully and cautiously. The only reason to bring anyone into your company as a participating equity partner is for the value they bring to the table. Do these people bring as much skill and talent to the table as you do? Why should they be entitled to equal shares in your start-up.

If you were to bring both brothers into the company with equal shares, you immediately become the minority partner and the "family" is the majority owner.

I have had personal experience with this. In fact, continue to do so as my own relative is currently 'dead wood' in a startup I am trying to launch. 

My advice on this would be simply don't do it. It helps not having your own relatives in so you do not lose a relationship and it also helps avoid any nasty situation where a relationship between the other partners does not backfire onto you. The existence of a familial relationship tends to sometimes also portray the wrong impression - that complacency is ok, which it is NOT in a startup serious about succeeding.

<p>I was warned about the issues that arise when you do business with family and friends early on as well. I wrote a pretty detailed blog post about this that covers 5 major concerns that you should take into account when doing business with friends or family:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Business Plan Development:</strong> Never fall into the trap of getting started
with ‘just’ a business idea. Sure you
have a greater level of trust with
your business partner but that does
not mean you would exclude putting
down on paper what it is that you
plan on achieving through this
business. The process of putting down
on paper what your idea is, clarifies
it, identifies key areas which you
need to work on and possible pitfalls
you may face. This is a step which
needs to be taken before you start
any venture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commitment Levels:</strong> With a business plan in place you will now
be able to judge with greater
certainty how much money, time and
effort is going to be required by the
business. You need to put down clear
parameters at this stage as to what
each partner is supposed to do. This
level of commitment needs to be
clarified from the start or you will
have an unbalanced partnership which
leads to a multitude of problems
further down the line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Candor:</strong> Establish a culture where candour needs to be an integral part
of the venture. The worst thing you
can do for yourself and your business
would be to keep all the things you
want to say to yourself. This will
lead to frustration, under
performance and morale issues which
can jeopardize the success of the
business. A culture where you can be
open, state your opinions and be
comfortable will help you form a
considerable competitive advantage
and will enable your company to make
difficult decisions with a lot more
ease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Noise Levels:</strong> When you set to do business with friends/family you need
to keep external noise levels under
strict controls. Noise levels refers
to the interference in the business
by members of your family or friends.
When we divulge too much information
outside the core group it ultimately
comes back to the core group in a
completely changed form. This could
lead to several problems between
partners, frustrate the team and
affect the overall morale.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equity Splits:</strong> This is an issue which is at the core of most problems
which are faced by all companies but
more so in businesses where friends
and family are involved. We tend to
be a lot more generous just because a
business partner is a cousin, friend
or relative. You need to correctly
assess what the partners contribution
will be and then use a simple model
to figure out how much the partners
stake is actually worth.</p></li>
</ul>

The fact that you are not comfortable right now and you are asking for advice should be enough reason for you not to do this. Follow your gut.
