I'm working to launch ASAP my product and need a Forum for support and knowledge-base purposes.

Because of time, money and other constraints cannot implement nor host it on my site (which is Azure based). Therefore I need to externalize it.

What affordable options do I have? can you recommend some providers?

<p>Do you want to externalize the development of the website? also the hosting? also the moderation?</p>

<p>If only the website, you could use something like <a href="http://OSQA.net" rel="nofollow">OSQA.net</a> which will give you a site similar as answers.onstartups.com.</p>

<p>If you need a hosted one, there is <a href="http://coordino.com" rel="nofollow">coordino.com</a></p>
