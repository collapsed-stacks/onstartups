I'm in Boston, and I am seriously envious of your networking opportunities. Here are some resources that will help you find networking events (and then from that, connections):

 - http://thestartupdigest.com by Chris McCann, hitting you with the best Silicon Valley events every week. You'll love this.

 - http://plancast.com/ is an events website that's currently centered around technology events. Follow everyone on the Featured Users box, especially Scoble who seems to go to every single freaking tech event ever, and you'll be smashed with a torrent of networking events.

 - http://meetup.com/ I don't know the effectiveness of meetup these days, but it was okay at getting me to introductory business networking events in Boston. I'm sure it's at least slightly better in SV.

 - http://groups.google.com/group/lean-startup-circle Don't forget Lean Startup Circle. If you're into starting startups, you'll want to be a part of this. Occasionally, there are some events posted here.

 - http://calendars.techvenue.com/cgi-bin/techvenue.pl?CalendarName=USValley Ugly as sin, but a lot of events are here too.

Good luck!
