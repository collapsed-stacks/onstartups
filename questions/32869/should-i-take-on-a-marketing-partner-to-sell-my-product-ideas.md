I am having good success with freelance sites over the last three years. I want to take the next step now: create my own products and services, with the goal of generating stable cash flow, so I can enjoy other things besides programming - I very badly want 6 packs :-).

What is stopping me is not having the skills to design and do Internet marketing. Basically I don't know how to sell. I have some product ideas that I think the market needs because I have been in touch with numerous clients. I can do the product but I don't know how to sell it.

So, I am wondering if it would be a good option for me to find a Internet marketing guy as partner who will help in shape the product better, promote it and sell it? 

What are the risks of taking on a partner? Is it worth pursuing? 

If any of you guys could you tell me the place to look for partners, I would appreciate it.

I am in India, a 23 yr old male, Developing in PHP(popular CMSes),Jquery,chrome extensions,air apps, android with phonegap.

Thanks

IMHO - If you can learn coding, you can learn internet marketing. It's not all affiliate deals and flashy single page squeeze pages that warrior type sites promote. google customer development / read a few lean books to get some other perspectives.  

But.. if you don't want to dedicate the time, then outsourcing it is always an option.

This is the biggest place-forum for internet marketing -> http://www.warriorforum.com/ you can find guys like that there that partner up with guys like you, and releasing the products together. I personalty know one guy who did just that. Try it maybe you get lucky and find someone.

Regarding the partnership, i'm few years older than you so i can't give you some wise answer on that. But i'll tell you that i have missed the chance to make some very good product ideas because i did't have partner and wanted to do all by myself. 
Go for it!

Yes, you should seek a marketing partner. Unfortunately, good partners rarely meet online. Look into your neighborhood first, and try to to find a partner among the people you already know even if they're not very experienced - you need commitment and reliability first, knowledge second. 

If that is not an option, then try to find a sales partner who will do both marketing and sales for you. For example, if you build a business application, then any established company that sells business software and/or services can do all the work for you, provided you give them appropriate incentive - usually a big portion of your software price. This is not a bad thing and is actually very recommended if you're trying to enter a market.

Good luck!
