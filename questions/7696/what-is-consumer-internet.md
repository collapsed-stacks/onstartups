Can anyone give me a one or two sentence definition of the term "Consumer Internet"? I feel like it is a phrase that is getting thrown around an awful lot, yet it seems extremely ambiguous. In different contexts it can seem to have different meanings...

Thanks

"Consumer Internet" is a market - offering a product / game / service that appeals to the consumer, vs "SaaS / MicroISV" which is a delivery strategy (software as a service) or a business definition (independent software vendor with one developer).

I would say it is used to describe services targeted at consumers (particulars) **as opposed to** businesses. I don't really see what could be confusing you... could you come up with a concrete example of an ambiguous usage of "Consumer Internet" ?
