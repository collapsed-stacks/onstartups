I  register my S-Corp in Delaware. I need to find a bank that can help me in opening a bank account, without having to go there in person. I have been told that this is possible if the bank has a branch in Delaware as well as in my own city. They will verify my credentials at my residence and then open a bank account in Delaware. (Please note that I need the account in company's name.)

**Nature of Business** -

Its online business and also trading ,we purchase goods like computers parts from MISSOURI and  exports computers parts to Africa. I am from India, while most of my employees are from Canada and UK - (only My one friend from USA.) we have no brick and mortar offices anywhere. In my country I am listed as a freelancer (thats how I started this business.) 
What I Want -

    I want to open Bank Account in Delaware without having to go there in person.
    I want to received and send USD from Bank 

Is that possible?

If you are not a citizen and are not here in the US I don't think you are going to have an easy time opening a bank account.

I had a similar problem.  It doesn't matter where the corporation was incorporated or where you buy things.

Here's what to do, if you can:

(1) Appoint your friend in the US as an officer or director of the company.
(2) Submit the business bank account application online to a bank that has a branch in the state where your friend lives.
(3) The bank may request your friend's Social Security number.  It's much easier if you use a bank where your friend already does business.
(4) You will need a US mailing address and physical presence.  You can use your friend's address if s/he is willing.  Otherwise you can set up an address at a UPS Store or a Regus location, but they may require you (or your friend) to go there in person.

Basically, to set up an account online, a bank will usually require a real person with a real physical location in a place where the bank has a branch.  I set up an account online with the bank where I already had accounts (as an individual) and I did it all online.  

If you use a bank where you or your friend don't already have an account, or at a bank that doesn't have a physical location where the company doesn't have a location or where it has no officers or directors, it will be very difficult.
