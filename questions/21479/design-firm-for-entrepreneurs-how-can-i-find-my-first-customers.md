Thanks for reading!

I am making plans to start a small consultancy with a focus on design & creative solutions for entrepreneurs and start-up companies… Services like product design, package design, branding, logo, graphics, brainstorming ideas, web design & programing, social media, marketing and so on… Basically all of the tools you might need to communicate your exciting new idea/product to the world.

i've been doing this for a few years now by myself and its highly gratifying work! I would really like to turn it into a business. I can't seem to find people that are specializing in this market, i'm not sure why? (perhaps this is a warning sign?) 

How can I find out if there is a sizable market to expand into? And how can I prove that it exists in my business plan for both myself and any potential investors? Where might I find my first customers? Where would do you currently go looking for these services?

I've also been mulling over a devision of the company to help entrepreneurs find investors and raise cash for their ideas as well as an idea generation/ creative think tank for new ideas?? (for later consideration)

Your thoughts and input on this subject are 100% appreciated!

Sarah, You got a lot of competition.
I would:

 1. Make sure you are on freelancer, Odesk, etc.  Make sure you build good reviews there. 
 2. Build a simple, elegant portoflio site that exposes your work.
 3. Give away some free work to get buzz, maybe create free icons you give away, or free generic logos you give away through your blog every once in a while.  
 4. Make sure you are involved in different design forums or showcase sites, even amatuer ones such as deviantart. You never know where your clients will find you. 
 5. When you have a client, and they are happy, dont be afriad to ask them to refer you to others.  Dont be afriad to ask them for more work every so often. 
 6. If you see a site or product that could use a re-design, dont hesitate to email them and offer your services.  


Good Luck

It seems you have had your first customers already, so well done.

Frank has covered the details of marketing communication on line well. You may or may not be aware of the less visible aspects of marketing

At our company, we create software, building the applications and partnering with designers/design houses like yourself. A significant portion of our business comes from entrepreneurs wanting to build web startups, so I have gotten some idea where they come from.

My advice would be to create a defined product: 

 1. get your offering clear. Ideally create a few packages that people can buy or use as starting points. Or make a light-weight engagement model.
 2. start networking and getting details of how cool and simple your offering is; you should get a few bites quickly and also feedback on the problems with your product
 3. choose a price; although this is essentially arbitrary, you still have to do it. Read "Don't roll the dice". Then stick to the price; discounting will kill your cashflow and all numbers are essentially arbitrary to startups.

Then in terms of analysing your target market:

 1. get the new business stats for your target area (are you focusing on your city, or country, or timezone, or the while internet) (in South Africa we have the department of trade & industry for stats)
 2. see what % of those you'd need to sell to to keep in business. 
 3. consider related markets (eg small business 1-5 years) if the startup niche feels too small

A small niche is a very good thing, it helps people to know your product is just right for them and all of your testimonials will be relevant.

And finally, take a look at peldi's talk: http://blog.businessofsoftware.org/2011/03/live-conversation-with-peldi-founder-or-balsamiq-on-his-talk-do-worry-be-happy.html . Although it's from the Business of Software conference, I think it'll be relevant to you. I just watched it this morning, it was great. I laughed, sometimes nervously. Lots of good advice in there, which I won't repeat.

Good luck!

<p>Sarah, </p>

<p>Bless you and your passion for this work. No one wants to be blunt. But I will. I will tell it like it is.</p>

<p>Don't do it. </p>

<p>Why? Because there is no money in it.
That is why there are so few competitors. </p>

<p>Entrepreneurs want (almost) everything for as cheap/free/lowcost as they possibly can. And as much as you and I understand the critical important of design, the unfortunate reality is that when the rubber hits the road-- the entrepreneur wont pay for it. </p>

<p>Just look at the other answer you got to this question. It is a good answer -- it got two (at the time of my rant) upvotes. It is the answer that 100 people just like you are getting right now. In their cubicles, coffesshops and design-classroom discussion. The end result is that there are tons of hungry talented folks offering to do basic design work for free to build their portfolios. </p>

<p>Search this site to see how many times 99designs is promoted. That is what you will be competing against. Not just in reality but in expectation. People thing that they should be able to get a corporate logo set "from $295" Now even if you pay yourself a dismal $30/hour -- you and I both know you can't do a real effective corporate logo targeting a specific market that captures the essence of a company and contributes to the telling of their story for $295. No, they get a 'fast-food" computer generates standard piece of shallow crap. And if that is what you are going to be doing-- then why do it right? </p>

<p>Search this site about design and see how many times people recommended that folks push it off, post pone , wait until they have the money, . . . .  and guess what-- much of the time they are right. The company shouldn't be spending money on good design until they have their product and customers and are generating real revenue. At which point they wont consider themselves a start up and will go to someone who target's their market a little differently. </p>

<p>My wonderful sister is an artist. <a href="http://www.barisonzi.com" rel="nofollow">A fantastic photographer</a>. I am so proud of her that he is making it. Early in her career she had a niche of doing album covers for bands. Everyone of them could be considered a micro start up. they needed the picture to produce the record, to go on tour, to build the fans to get the record deal. So they were always asking her to please take the picture for a "piece of the action" Yeah, right -- investing in bands is almost as bad as films, or restaurants. She put her foot down, said no -- and hasn't looked back. Now she has the capacity to help out when she can-- because employees are being paid and the rent check is covered. </p>

<p>If you are doing it now and it is fulfilling -- fantastic. keep doing it. Grow it organically. Do what you can handle. Hire an assistant when you can afford it so that your capacity to do more grows. . Build longterm relationships with the serial entrepreneurial so that you can design him a new logo set every 10 years or so. </p>

<p>But don't kill it by thinking it is a business. :)</p>

<hr>

<p>If you choose to ignore everything I said above -- great-- could you throw me a card or a link so I can see some of your work. We always need someone for niche projects. :)</p>
