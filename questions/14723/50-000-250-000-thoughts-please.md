WE are just about to roll out our pivate equity fund, the raise is 100MM. Over the years we have accumulated many 50,000 type investors. What would you suggest is the minimum investment amount? How much significance will be attributed to the take away value of a first look of the PPM on the minimum, should it be higher?

A $100MM raise with $50k or $250k minimum unit !! Wow.. It implies upto 2000 investors in the fund. Have never heard of such a raise. Dont think  you can make that many calls or meetings, or the raise would be several years.  I would keep the minimum at $500k.
