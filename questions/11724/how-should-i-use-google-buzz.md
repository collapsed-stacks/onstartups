While twitter has proven to be a great tools to get the word out about your ideas, there has been less hype about how Buzz can do similar things.

I'm curious as to whether Buzz is just a tool for private communication, or whether it can be used for business. Are there any examples of how business can use Buzz to engage customers?

My understaning is that it just hasn't caught on so focus on the 500 mil + facebook for the 9 mil + twitter or a niche site that is focused on your busienss.

I could see if you had your employee group all on gmail and you you share the whole rss from reader or a blog with each other to look at but how it gains traction when it feels apart of your email (which who wants to share their mail?).

So my 2 cents.
