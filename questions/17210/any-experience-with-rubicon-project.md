I came across, what seems another ad network, but they claim to be able to optimize and fill your ad inventory better. Does anyone have any experience with [Rubicon Project][1] and do they indeed have a better system or is it just another clever hype? 

Thanks.

Here's a follow up to my own question. After creating an account on Rubicon Project and adding ad code to my site I noticed that the site was able to track couple of thousand impressions but there still was a "Disabled" tag next to my site's name. The service provides no easy way to contacting them. After poking around the site I found a form and sent them my concern about the disabled status. I never heard back and as a result I removed all Rubicon Project code from my site. 

If someone had a better experience with them, please feel free to share.

Its hype, all these websites look the same.

What i advise you to do is:
If you are a publisher, look at the Advertiser info.  It will promise you the world of how you will get the best rates.

If you are an advertiser, see what they sell their publishers.
Its again hype!


A commenter above stated you are best off selling your own ad inventory.
What i suggest is you use a fixed price venue such as buysellads.com, 
Keep track of what is being posted on your site (who buys ads)
Then sell to them direct!

CUT THE FAT, but once you recognize who will pay for your ads.
