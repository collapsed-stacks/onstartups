I sell software and have recently been contacted by a company that says they have been charged twice for software purchased from my web site, the software sells for $1000 USD. They did purchase one license over a year ago, they have sent me what is basically a credit card statement which shows a second purchase six months later (11 months ago) for another $1000, the statement doesn't make it obvious that the purchase was made via my site but it is possible, I guess they could ask their bank/visa etc to verify this, I've asked for further proof.

I have no way that I can charge their card, I use a payment processor and never see the customers details. To be charged twice they must have purchased again themselves. If they do turn round and prove that the purchase was made at my web site, then they must have purchased again I can't see any other explanation for it. My question is do I have to refund this purchase? 

Thanks
Jane

If the purchase was made for the same exact product and version I would refund the money. 

Why will a company order the same software twice? unless they needed a second license but this might not be the case depending on how you license your software.

If they just made a mistake ordering the software twice, why not return the money? specially when they are a paying customer of yours. 

Treat them the same way you would like to be treated. That is my opinion.

<p>You don't have to refund the purchase unless you do believe that your payment processor did indeed charge them twice.</p>

<p>Given the data you presented, it's more likely they purchased it twice.</p>

<p>Even if they do try to reverse that payment via chargeback, they won't necessarily succeed. There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargeback" rel="nofollow">rules</a> for when you can request a chargeback and there's usually a <a href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/archive/index.php/t-226782.html" rel="nofollow">6 month time limit</a>.</p>

<p>You might still decide to refund even if you don't have to, but it's more about what you think is fair than what your legal obligation is.</p>
