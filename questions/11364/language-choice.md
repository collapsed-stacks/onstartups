Whats the pros and cons for using the following languages in an shopping site application. One of the core bits, it needs to access 3 third party APIs. These all work via soap calls. 

The choices are, 
.net (asp.net for the web + c# application layer)
php 
java 
also possibe: php on the website + java on the server.

There database possibly mySQL.

Will using .net mean a HUGE license bill??


Thanks!

Licensing is, at least for a few years, a non-issue.  You can join the Microsoft BizSpark program and get your fill of licenses.  Take that off the table:  The question is what is the toolset you can be most effective in quickly.  You need to be able to create a product quickly, refine it in response to user input, and have this all leave you with enough time to market, network, and do all of the other things that it takes to be successful.  

When you're successful you can even port it off to something else entirely or whatever.  The key is that it doesn't sound like there's any reason for your customers to care what you wrote it in for you to deliver the value you want so do what's easiest for you.  Now, if you're not the one that's going to be coding it the question is what is the easiest option for the people that will:  Typically either friends you're already partnering with or whatever's widely available and affordable in your area.

I could go on, but the point is that Microsoft has a range of programs to keep their licensing very affordable (all but free) for startup companies.  So pick based on what's going to get you in your situation to market fastest.

You are making a good choice though we can debate which platform to use/Why not open source etc for days! Your focus should be to quickly come out with the beta version and take the feedback from the customer. Once you are confident about your idea/software, you can always re-look at the technology stack and take the right decision based on your criteria
