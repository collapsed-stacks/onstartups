I would like to know of any sites/places who specialize in supplying logo+businesscards+stationary package. We are a small startup and really dont want to incur unnecessary expenditure. 

Just to be clear, I am not looking to spend more than $150 bucks for the design and maybe 75 bucks for getting the cards and stationary printed. So around $200 -$250 is our budget.  

One site I have visited is 99designs.com I want some thing along those lines where my logo + company name is customized, business card and letter head designed and all I would have to do is print them or put the logo on my site.

Thanks

<p><a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/" rel="nofollow">Crowdspring</a> is another site just like 99designs. A question asking which of the two is better was asked <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/8281/crowdspring-or-99designs" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've also come across <a href="http://logoworks.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">Logoworks</a>, but I have no experience with them, so I'm not sure how good they are.</p>

+1 vote for VistaPrint. They are excellent, reliable and deliver good quality products. They constantly give items away for free (pay s&h) and they have a wide array of marketing products, plus you can upload your own designs.

Also, my company, www.lucidstrategies.net also does logo design. Contact us at lucid[at]lucidstrategies[dot]net and we can discuss details and pricing.
