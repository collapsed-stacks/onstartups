<p>Judging by the <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/os-market-share.aspx?qprid=9" rel="nofollow">OS market share numbers</a> (Windows having 90%+ market share), I would think that the majority of the people using a personal computer today would stick with the default, which is Windows Media Player.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to get into more detail, you could look at different niches and aim a plugin at certain players.  I would think that people who really enjoy paying for their music would use iTunes, but there is also the <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/" rel="nofollow">Zune Market &amp; software</a>.</p>

<p>Often you can find data on this in certain places for different niches:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/397135/five-best-desktop-media-players" rel="nofollow">The Five Best Desktop Media Players</a> (as voted by Lifehacker.com readers)</li>
<li><a href="http://download.cnet.com/windows/media-players/?tag=mncol%3Bsort&amp;rpp=10&amp;sort=downloadCount+asc" rel="nofollow">Download.com's Top Downloaded Media Players</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The answer to this question depends greatly on what your target audience is.  If you're looking at the enthusiast market, <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/" rel="nofollow">Foobar2000</a>, <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" rel="nofollow">VLC</a> or <a href="http://www.winamp.com/" rel="nofollow">WinAMP</a> would be the way to go.</p>

<p>Last.fm provides mid-2008 statistics for <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/RJ/journal/2008/07/09/227qin_popular_client_ids_by_country" rel="nofollow">most popular media players</a> (<a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache%3aVrJgMf2y3wcJ%3awww.last.fm/user/RJ/journal/2008/07/09/227qin_popular_client_ids_by_country+Popular+clients+ids+by+country&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">alternate link</a>) by country, and did the same <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/RJ/journal/2006/05/25/rj_most_popular_media_players_by_country" rel="nofollow">in 2006</a> (<a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache%3aaVJWCnkj9JYJ%3awww.last.fm/user/RJ/journal/2006/05/25/rj_most_popular_media_players_by_country+Popular+media+players&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">alternate link</a>) (which may be even more useful, since by 2008 the majority of Last.fm users were using the online client).</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, I would say most music plugins are written for iTunes. For instance, there is the <a href="http://www.ilike.com" rel="nofollow">iLike</a> iTunes sidebar. However, I'm not sure where you can find exact usage data for each player.</p>
