<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

I have been starting the preliminary backside coding to a new web project that I am starting. I have seed money that I am using for initial costs, but I know there will be a gap in time from that money running out to me being ready to have customers and advertisers to start a good revenue stream.

My question is this, do you know of any reputable angel investment websites or resources that I could use to help with this gap in funding? I have looked at business incubators and such but have not found any close to my area (near Green Bay, WI, USA)

Thanks in advance.

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://angel.co/" rel="nofollow">AngelList</a>. It's a directory of business angels worldwide, and you can submit your startup to all (or only some) of them directly from the website.</p>

<p>Best resources is to make a little money, and then get friends/family/etc. to lend money at a good rate with the option to covert the loan to equity at a later date at the value of the company on the date the loan is converted to equity.</p>
