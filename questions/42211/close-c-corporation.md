I have a co-founder on our C-Corporation. We agreed to close the company. Both of us may use the concept in one form or another to start new business. Do we need some kind of separation agreements to waive any future claims?

<p>I suggest signing a mutual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_release" rel="nofollow">release</a>.  You can release each other from any and all legal liability relating to the C corp.  In addition, specifically list any items you are particularly concerned about.  For example, that either of you may use any intellectual property formerly owned by the C corp for any purpose.  This should give both of you some peace of mind.</p>
