Is there any software like Balsamiq Mockups to have a mockup of your business plan?
I need to show  the how things will work as a biz plan instead of how things will work on the website.

As far as I saw in their page http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups#examples it's only about the website or applications.

Thank you.

<p>You're looking for a "business plan template".</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://www.score.org/resources/business-plans-financial-statements-template-gallery" rel="nofollow">SCORE</a> and the <a href="http://web.sba.gov/busplantemplate/BizPlanStart.cfm" rel="nofollow">Small Business Association</a> have templates available.</p>

<p>Sequoia Capital offers a guide and outline to what they look for in a business plan as well:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> One of the best new tools in recent years is <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas" rel="nofollow">the business model canvas</a>, a one-page view of all the key pieces of your business model: </p>

<p>In lean startups, it's meant to be an evolving document that helps you keep track of the assumptions under each category that you are testing.</p>

<p>I am struggling to imagine how you could apply the idea of something like balsamiq to a business plan - can you elaborate?</p>

<p>Are you looking at something like <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/about-viewing-a-document-as-an-outline-HP005235923.aspx" rel="nofollow">Outline viewing</a> in Word where you can 'sketch' out your organisation of your document</p>

<p>Or something like <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">mind mapping</a>?</p>
