My company is Canadian and I'm planning to purchase a VPS account for my business with a Dallas,TX based company. But I'm being told by a friend that this may be a problem for the following reason:

 *Apparently itâ€™s illegal for a Canadian based company to run on servers outside of Canada? Something to do with Canadian public information being accessible to foreigners.*
   

Does anyone know if this is true?

<p>Not quite correct.</p>

<p>You are, as a Canadian company, allowed to host your website where you want, whether in Canada or elsewhere. However, what your friend may be referring to is something called <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/">PIPEDA</a> which governs what you can and cannot do with information entrusted to you electronically.</p>

<p>No matter where your servers are, since you are in Canada, and your company is a Canadian company, you must abide by the Canadian rules. The fact that your servers are not located in Canada will not exempt you from abiding by Canadian law.</p>
