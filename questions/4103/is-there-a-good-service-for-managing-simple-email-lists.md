I have a select set of customers that I would to provide info to on a regular basis via email.  I could just create a email alias in outlook but then I would have to manage any subscriptions or un-subscriptions that people wanted to make.

I'd like to find a service that will handle this well.  I have used google and yahoo groups for personal stuff but they munge the emails so much they no longer look professional and I don't want to use them for work related stuff.

I would also like to be able to add people without them having to go and create an account somewhere.  I've also tried to see if some form of social network would be acceptable but this group would really prefer to just get emails rather than having to check a different system.

Are there any services out there that are relatively inexpensive that would work?

If you google for "email marketing", you'll find a lot of options.  MailChimp looks good, and it's free for small lists.  ConstantContact is very popular.

<p>I had a client rave to me about <a href="http://www.bronto.com/" rel="nofollow">Bronto</a> for their e-mail marketing / newsletter publication.</p>
