I have the opportunity to join a company in a new industry.  I'm not sure if it's 100% the type of work I want to do, but it seems like a very interesting opportunity and I'll get to be around a bunch of smart people.  On the other hand, I've been offered a position at a startup (I'd be the third employee) where I really like the people, but I'm not sure if it's the most promising business model.  They have enough money to run at the current rate for at least a year, so I'm not worried about it immediately going under (although that is of course a risk), but I don't know about the long term.

In the startup, I'd make less money, but not so much less.  Plus, I'd have a small ownership stake (which may never amount to anything).  If it went under, I'd have enough savings to sustain me for at least 6 months, most likely more.

In the other company, I'd get to try out something new and work in an exciting part of the city, whereas in the startup I'd work from home and be 1500 miles away from the other two employees (one of which I've worked with extensively in the past).

I'm torn between the options - I don't want to jump on the startup if I'm not 100% sure of it's prospects, but I'd be able to help guide it if I were to join.  If I join the other company, I'll get interesting experience and expand my professional network in case I want to do a start up later on.  Neither necessarily seems like the perfect opportunity, but there are pros and cons to both.

**Update**

At the startup, I'd also be the only technical member, so I'd have to work out most problems.  Have others found it to be an issue if there is only one technical member?

<p>Great question. I have a few ideas that may help you come to a decision.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison Matrix</strong></p>

<p>The first suggestion is a bit anal &amp; time-consuming. I've used this approach before for tough decisions and it's worked for me. But then again, that's just me. Create a matrix listing the pros &amp; cons of each. For instance, column 1 is the startup. Column 2 is the large company. The first row could be salary. In each cell, you can give that item a score of 1-3 (1 being poor, 2 being okay, 3 being great).</p>

<p>In the first cell (startup's salary), you could list a 2. In the second cell (company's salary), you could list a 3. Then you continue down the list.</p>

<p>For extra geekiness, you could weigh each attribute. Perhaps the type of work is really important to you. You could multiple the numbers in that row by x2 or more.</p>

<p>Then you add up the numbers and see if one or the other has more points.</p>

<p><strong>Earn or Learn</strong></p>

<p>Mark Suster has another method: "<a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/11/04/is-it-time-for-you-to-earn-or-to-learn/" rel="nofollow">Is it Time for You to Earn or to Learn?</a>" The basic premise is that joining a startup isn't always an easy path to riches. A lot of hard work and time is involved. If you're looking for riches, to "Earn" (as he puts it), then you need to be a co-founder or high-ranking executive, not just an early employee.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you're there to "Learn," to grow your skills and your career. There's nothing wrong with this path. It just means your expectations change. You're not expecting to cash out and retire if you're on this path.</p>

<p><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong></p>

<p>Other consideration is the opportunity cost you will incur choosing one over the other. If you choose the startup, what will you have missed out on at the large company? I assume the answer might be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Working with smart people</li>
<li>Having a stable salary &amp; potential bonuses</li>
<li>Career advancement</li>
<li>Skill advancement</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the opportunity cost of choosing the large company over the startup? I assume it might be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chance to steer the direction of a startup</li>
<li>Leadership opportunities</li>
<li>Potentially more interesting work (you alluded to not being sure of the large company's type of work, so I assume it's more interesting at the startup)</li>
<li>Potential riches (though Suster's article dispels this belief)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just sample bullet points. You can list the opportunity costs of each for yourself. Then look over the lists and see if one or the other incites a greater feeling of regret. It's my belief that one should never look back at life and have regrets. "It's better to have tried and failed, than to have walked away and regret never having tried at all," I always say.</p>

<p><strong>It's All About The People</strong></p>

<p>Job satisfaction is largely about the people you will work with. Which group of people can you see working with eight hours a day, five days a week (or potentially more)?</p>

<p>At a startup, you will see the worst in people. When times get tough, true personalities can emerge. Large companies tend to give people more room to hide this. Certain personalities thrive better in startups, other personalities thrive better in large companies.</p>

<p><strong>One Last Point</strong></p>

<p>This point is going to argue in favor of the startup, though I should state that I, in no way, am saying this is the better choice for you. I just wanted to share some of my personal thoughts having been in startups, Fortune 500 companies, and being a technical member of a startup.</p>

<p>The startup experience can be extremely harsh. As I mentioned before, all kinds of personality tics come out. There will also be disagreements that can reach personal levels. Being in a startup isn't for everyone. Be aware of this as you consider the startup.</p>

<p>At the same time, it gives you invaluable experience. You can't get this kind of experience at a large company at all. You'll be required to do a little of everything - from scaling the databases to setting up the servers to architecting the application code to dealing with cross-browser bugs. AND, you'll have to deal with marketing, operations, product management, product strategy, UI design, recruiting, customer service, and QA testing.</p>

<p>You can take this experience and get a job at a large company easily. This kind of experience is very desirable and quite transferable. It may even give you opportunities at other startups, opportunities that won't be open to you if you've only worked at large companies.</p>

<p><em>Being The Only Technical Member</em></p>

<p>Now, being the only technical member... this is an interesting role. You're going to be given a lot of power. They're going to trust you with the keys to the product, more or less. But you'll need to extend your influence further than just the technical realm in order to create a sustainable architecture. You'll need to know when to compromise and build it quickly (time to market is more important than scalability in an early startup), when to outsource or build it internally, and how to evaluate multiple technologies, and how to build a flexible architecture.</p>

<p>Many classically-trained developers that I know tend to get frustrated with ever-changing product specs. This is a fact of life in a startup, however. The best startups are the ones that can change on a dime (read about the <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html" rel="nofollow">lean startup</a> practices for more info on being highly flexible &amp; agile).</p>

<p>It can be stressful to not have anyone else to bounce ideas with, especially when dealing with architecture. This is where you'll need a good support system of peers. It can also be stressful to have product &amp; strategy people imagining features that seem daunting to implement. This just requires an open, problem-solving mind, a lot of patience, and strong communication skills so you can explain to them the technical impact of their brainstorms.</p>

<p>One last point before I wrap up this novel. Just because their business model isn't great now doesn't mean they won't be successful as a team. I'm a firm believer that a smart group of people will be able to learn &amp; adapt the business to the market. The lean startup practices are one way to do this. As their sole technical member, you'll be responsible for sharing your doubts, listening to their arguments, and helping them come up with a better business model.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Good luck!</p>

I was so close suggesting you to go work for the startup, until I read you'll be working from home.

Working in an isolated environment can hold you down from learning things.  

Everything I've learn in my career was because I had first the competition at work and second someone to bounce my ideas and believes.

I think you answered your own question by saying:  
"I'll get interesting experience and expand my professional network in case I want to do a start up later on"

That's never easy.  Probably both are good choices and you can reduce your stress with that mindset.

With that said, "pretend" you have made a choice.  First choose one, then the other one.  After each "choice" see how you feel - if you regret the decision or not.  If the feelings are similar in strength then you still have a tough choice ahead.  

Note, this is only an emotional response, and just a part of the decision making process.  

Best wishes.  Let us know how it turns out.

The startup needs to address how you will handle a future development team. Being the single developer at the start probably has more advantages than disadvantages (All that Mythical Man Month stuff). You need to make sure this business has the potential to grow beyond one developer. And when that happens, you need to have a large say in who gets hired and that they are located near you. If your startup partners begin to build offices near them, you don't want that to be an influence.

What a wonderful problem to have!

I've been working full time on a start up since September. I spent a career with a large global Fortune 10 company and this is a completely different experience - moving from 400K employees to a start up with 3 and now all the way up to 6 people. 

There are some things to be said for building skills with a more traditional firm. On the other hand, I learn something - or actually "lots of somethings" - every day with the start up and feel like I'm genuinely building something. 

Could you be a "close advisor" to the start up - with some equity for you - and continue to pursue the traditional company approach? If the start up looks to be more promising down the road, you could move then and you'd have built your skills and network first. 

Good luck + let us know what you decide, please!
