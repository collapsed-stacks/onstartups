We are building a startup, we are a few weeks away from our MVP launch. We have had some initial positive investor conversations with an angel and a couple VCs.  One large VC that generally doesn't do seed funding suggested that they would introduce us to seed stage investors who they have worked with and respect. 

My question is, should we limit the number of people we talk to about investing.  I suspect the time commitment could get out of hand if we do too many of these meetings, but obviously we want to give ourselves the benefits of more alternatives.

Appreciate any thoughts,

<p>This is a little like asking "How many places should I look for my life partner?" The answer is keep looking until you find the right one.</p>

<p>The same thing with investors, don't just stettle for the first one that comes along, keep looking until you find one you feel comfortable with and with whom you can live.</p>

<p>Before talking to potential investors it is important for you to think about what exactly you want from an investor, generally it should be more than just money.</p>

Get 2-3 investors (VCs) interested. If you have only one it will be harder to negotiate on the termsheet and your valuation will be lower. Besides it's better if you can choose between 2 or 3 offers (with each its own termsheet). Do not mention who are they competing with, otherwise they will group up and lower your valuation...
