I have been building a SAAS product for a vertical industry for the last two years. The product is now pretty mature. As a geek my sales and marketing skills are pretty rubbish so am are looking at getting a new 'co-founder' who is an expert in sales, but unsure what equity would be considered fair. I am considering 60/40 split. For a startup that already has a product that would seem pretty generous. If we were starting from scratch obviously it would be 50/50.

Before deciding on a 60/40 split or awarding any equity, you may want to consider the following:

 1. Equity is a way, but not the only way to reward someone who brings
    in sales. Performance bonus based on sales brought in is another
    way. If your sales cycle is longer than a month, I'd recommend bonus
    calculated from quarterly recognition of sales to encourage
    consistent sales performance each quarter. You may also want to add
    to the performance bonus by sales growth quarter year-on-year to
    encourage retention. These helps also to gauge the salesperson's
    confidence of delivering sales as you're rewarding for consistency
    and not one-time-hits.
 2. If you're planning to attract future investors, equity that has been
    awarded may be diluted. Will the salesperson agree to that or will
    he/she (as an equity holder) prevent more equity injection in the
    future?
 3. Why not given stock options instead of stock awards? This encourages
    performance and not promise/potential of performance.

Hope this helps.
