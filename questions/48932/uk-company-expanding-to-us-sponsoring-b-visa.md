I work for a UK LTD company who wants to expand to the US. They're arranging the paperwork to start a US business entity, and we have a queue of US customers that means this business will be profitable immediately.

I would personally like to oversee the initial phase of the launch, and I don't think the three month visa waiver period is long enough.

Am I right in thinking my options are:

A) travel on a waived visa (3 months), begin operations in the US then apply for a business visa (further 3 months) from within the US to extend my visit

B) apply for a business visa (6 months) then try for sponsorship from the new US company

C) immediately apply for a sponsored visa before the business is even trading


Are any (or all!) of these options impossible? I don't know where to concentrate my energies.

Any help or guidance would be well received.

Generally, your company can probably afford a US immigration lawyer to handle everything. This is not a "do it yourself" situation. So don't bother thinking about it as it is not for you to think or decide.

Specifically to your questions:

> travel on a waived visa (3 months), begin operations in the US then
> apply for a business visa (further 3 months) from within the US to
> extend my visit

Not an option. You cannot do that. Visa Waiver entry **forbids** any changes or extensions. If you entered on VWP - you get 3 months B1/B2 (visitor) status, you cannot be employed or do any work, and you *must* leave after 3 months, **no exceptions**. B1 status (business visitor) is not applicable here, as you plan on actually working ("overseeing"). It is only intended for those coming to conduct business - meetings, sales pitches, etc. Not something that is an actual job.

> apply for a business visa (6 months) then try for sponsorship from the
> new US company

No such thing as "business visa". You must be thinking about the standard B1/B2 (tourist) visa. This is not a "business visa", and no-one promises you 6 months stay (although it is common). This is basically the same as VWP, except that you can stay for longer and change status. This is still not applicable for you, as you plan on working and B1/B2 forbids working (whether you entered with a visa or without - doesn't matter, its the same B1/B2 status).

> immediately apply for a sponsored visa before the business is even
> trading

That's your only option. If you qualify - you can get a L1A (international manager) visa, but *your company* (not you!) must request it.

As I said - this is something your company should hire a US immigration attorney to deal with, and that attorney will advise you properly. This is not a legal advice and I'm not a lawyer. Employment visas are not "DIY", and you have to have a proper legal counsel at every step.
