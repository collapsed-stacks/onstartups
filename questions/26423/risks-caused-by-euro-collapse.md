I am running a start-up business in Denmark. Denmark is not a part of the Euro, but the currency has been pegged to the Euro for many years. I believe that there is a significant risk of a collapse of the Euro, and I am not really interested in discussing this risk. What I am after is what the possible consequences to a collapse could be? As I do not expect to find information specific to Denmark, I am very interested to general information for businesses in the Euro-zone. 

A way to read about this would be to read scenarios from larger companies about the consequences of such a collapse. I believe especially Shell is putting significant resources into creating such scenarios, and I would be most interested to read such scenarios or your qualified opinion on the consequences.

EDIT: By collapse I mean that a significant number or all of Euro-zone countries return to their old currencies, which they had before the Euro.

**Assuming the Danish economy is fundamentally sound:**

 - I consider this a reasonable assumption due to the maturity and structure of the Danish economy.

 - The peg to the Euro likely keeps your currency artificially low within the general zone due to stronger economic growth.
 - The korune is likely to appreciate due to people seeking less risky Euro currencies.

It's more likely to unraval with individual countries withdrawing than catastrophically collapse. So **fluctuations can vary depending on which countries withdraw** or remain:

You're concerned about countries using the Euro that are major trading partners.

Top export partners (2009): Germany 17.53%, Sweden 12.68%, UK 8.49%, US 6.05%, Norway 6.01%, Netherlands 4.84%, France 4.57%

Top import partners (2009): Germany 21.07%, Sweden 13.18%, Norway 7%, Netherlands 6.97%, China 6.22%, UK 5.53%

Of these partners using the Euro: Germany, Netherlands, France

Exports seem to trend 5-10b greater than imports for 2009/2010. While both imports and exports are close in number, it can still cause economic pain if Danish exports become too expensive.

I think **you're probably fortunate that Germany is the largest partner** since their economy is fundamentally strong and healthy. Your currency probably may not "hyper-appreciate/depreciate" against a "Deutch Mark". And even if the korune appreciated significantly, exports would not be critically hit due to German ability to absorb price increases. 

**Benefits of current structure that mitigate risk:** 

- A lot of economic integration with significant trading partners who also have respectable economies. This makes the relationships more adaptable to changes. (The weakest partners listed would be France and China.)

- Dealing in multiple currencies is part of business as usual for you. You wouldn't have to adjust to this as much as a country leaving the Eurozone.

- Your economy and its businesses might already be more diversified in regards to its currency holdings.

**Protections:** 

- Evaluating your sources of risk. (This what you're doing now, good job.)

- Risk management by spreading cash holdings over a basket of currencies such as GBP, USD, Swedish and Norwegian crowns. This is easier and safer than an often futile strategy of trying to forecast currency movements.

- You can buy currency futures to smooth out future known income.

- Diversify your source countries of income if possible.


**Avoid:**

Speculating or forecasting. You'd be gambling in a game with quick experienced traders and hedge funds who can  move markets. Economic turmoil, such as a Eurozone collapse, creates economic inefficiencies that they're trained to take advantage of.


**Disclaimers:**

- Of course, this analysis could go deeper and consider other factors. Feel free to critique or add to this. I put my thoughts out hoping to learn something.

- Primary sources of your business income matter. If you could provide more information on this, it would help. Also, the primary sources of your customers' income matters too.

- Interest rate movements between countries can result in a lot of fluctuation. Interest rates also depend on other interdependent factors. Lots of feedback.

- Fundamental health means that an economy is more able to adapt and compete within a market system, not their current economic luck. (China has strong growth, but as a developing economy the fundamentals aren't there.)

- A lot of flows make predictions hard to make. Prepare for bad times, but don't be so conservative that you don't take profitable business risks.

One consequence is obvious. With a devalued currency the buying bower of the population will shrink for the products that are imported, like all of the consumer electronics, for example. During the last crisis I clearly saw the prices bumped up at German Amazon. Businesses which depend on local individual consumers will experience the loss of revenues.
