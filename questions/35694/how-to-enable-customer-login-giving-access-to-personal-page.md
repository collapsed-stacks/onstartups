I would like to build a website that will let visitors register and get access to their own personal admin page.

So user #1 will input his login and password and get access to his admin page with his parameters. User #2 will see his own parameters, etc.

Ideally I would like a ready-made solution. Is this possible with a wordpress or joomla theme, or with additional plugins? and if yes, how do you recommend to achieve this?

The solution might be obvious to you... but it is not to me.

Any hint is much appreciated.
