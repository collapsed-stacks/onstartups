My company needs to have a US address for getting insurance and other services from US providers, despite us being based abroad (in Canada). 

Can anyone suggest a good provider of an inbound mailing address (e.g. virtual office services, or mail scanners/forwarders)? We need it to be both reasonable in cost and very reliable - good enough for business/legal correspondence, not just for telephone bills.

Hopefully I'm not the first one to have faced this, and perhaps others can benefit from the answers too!

<p>I researched this topic about a year ago. If you can visit US, I believe you can set up a mailing address with <a href="http://www.theupsstore.com/products/pages/maiandpos.aspx" rel="nofollow">UPS</a> (complete with a street address, not just a PO box). Then there are "virtual office" providers such as <a href="http://www.regus.com/" rel="nofollow">Regus</a> who provide a more "full-service" solution. Then there is <a href="http://www.earthclassmail.com/" rel="nofollow">EarthClassMail</a>, they have a couple of addresses you can use, too.</p>

if you need more of a full-service solution (address, telephone, billing, answering etc), go with Regus.  Notice that they also have different locations - so you can choose a cheap one (their expensive ones can be EXPENSIVE).  They wont be able to compete with the $9/month guys that do mailing only, but if you need a full presence to make it look as if you really are there, that does the trick.
