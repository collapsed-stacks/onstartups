We're currently looking at building an internal affiliate program vs. having a 3rd party manage it.  This will require us to make some payments to our affiliates via cheques.  Does anyone know of any software or tools to automate cheque payments?  I'm assuming large corps must have a similar system for paying POs, etc...?

Any reasonably competent small-business accounting system (like QuickBooks Pro) can trivially generate checks. They all have APIs (for example, here is the [Quickbooks API](http://qbsdk.developer.intuit.com/sdk/qb)) so generating a big stack of checks programmatically is probably a matter of a day's work for a competent software developer.
