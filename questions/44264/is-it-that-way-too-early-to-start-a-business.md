I have been sharing my thoughts for getting into some business, with some of my friends & colleagues, but all I get from them is 'Disappointment' & advice like "It's too early for you to do a business. You need to have loads of experience to startup your own business".

All I need to know: is it really that necessary for me to have an experience. ?

As far as I know  even if I get some other experience it would take a lot of time for me to settle down & startup on my own. I have seen many of them starting their piece at a very ripe age. 

Please Advise.

I am 27yrs old holding a bachelors degree(B.E.), working as a Technical Analyst in an MNC with 3+yrs of exp.

You are adult enough to start your own business if you are very keen on it, but what matters above the concerns you mentioned is the viable idea or projects, capital and execution to sustain in business, if idea/project is huge you may need to involve many people, managing finance and all other aspects of business needs patience, dedication, hard work and strive for quality with low operational costs,

Take a moment and think are you all set to dive in, well analyze the consequences of failures.
and if all seems okay then it's time to dive in :)

Comparing with the question about too early or not, a more important question is what business you are going to do.

If you have already know what customer want, know rough in and out of this field, and have a rough plan of funding and profit, nothing can stop you from starting right now.

If you just thought you should do business or stay in MNC, it's not mature yet. It would be better if you think over the viability of the business itself.

Venkatesh,

The Golden Rule for starting any kind of Business is to find out:

Any one can start a Business provided:

 - One should do Market Research

You have a BE background + your MNC experience will be beneficial for you.
I will suggest you should start working on your plan.

ALL THE BEST

If you wait longer, it may be too late! It's much much better to start earlier while you are young, without lots of obligations to other people (e.g. family), while you can sleep in the car if needed, etc.

If you fail fast while you are young, you will learn a lot for your next journey and that will help you make better choices later.

About running a company - you'll learn along the way. 

So the question for you is this: are you super passionate to start your own business or not? If yes, go do it, if not, stay where you are. 

Age has nothing to do with it.

As large of a proponent I am of the open and robust exchange of ideas - and how strong said ideas become as a result - I'm starting to realize that not everything needs to be shared with people. The more foreign the idea, the more likely some will be to express their negative opinions. I've found myself having to explicitly express to people "What I'm looking for is constructive criticism and - if all you have to offer is negativity - we can just stop being friends." I cannot speak as to whether these people really have good intentions or what, but what you're asking may come down to a matter of personal preference rather than how much experience you do or don't need.

Of course this also depends on what markets your business will focus on, what role you envision for yourself (as in are you a technical founder or not, etc). These will be the true deciding factors, more so than age or experience.

You need two people to start a business. One person has to have the ideas and ability to transform that into a product and service. The other person needs to be able to drive the sales and support of that product and service. Those two people can be one, however, many are usually better at one or the other. Find out which you are and if you aren't both, get someone who is that other person.
