I have a free iOS app with about 2000 daily active users. I just submitted an app update that includes Apple's iAds. Now I'm curious about how much revenue I can  generate with this user count.

I came across [this article][1] in which the author mentions decent download counts but disappointing ad revenue. The author doesn't mention any daily active user metrics. I'm guessing his app's retention rate was low hence the low ad revenue.

I think my situation is different from the author's because my app's retention rate is decent. Hence I'm curious about the potential ad revenue. **Anyone have iOS apps that generated decent ad revenue from Apple's iAds?**

Download counts, daily active user counts and any other relevant metrics are appreciated! I'll include my ad revenue numbers in a week or two when my app update goes live.

I read somewhere that the average CTR for iAds is between 0.5% - 1% (depending on your market) with an average EPC of $0.20 being banded about. So basing it on a best case scenario for you would be:

**Revenue per day**

2000 * 1% * 0.2 = $4 

**Revenue per month**

2000 * 1% * 0.2 * 30 = $120

Only way to tell is to try it and give it time. If you hit a freakish CTR of 10% (which happens) it's a completely different story!

could it be the a "password generation" application is used for seconds, occasionally  only to generate something and then quit? it's a utility, not an application you spend a lot of time in, such as games or content apps. I guess this could explain the reason for the disappointing ad results reported in the link.
