<p>what costs do I need to consider and factor into my total cost when determining how much to charge for a subscription service?  </p>

<p>I am developing a web based application with various subscription levels from free to premium (with one or two steps in between). </p>

<p>It is easy enough to determine hardware/up-time costs as my provider (heroku) has a nice model that tells me how much they'll be charging me to keep the site running at a specific capacity. </p>

<p>However I don't want to just break even on my website nor do I want to overcharge and push business away from me. </p>

<p>Do I factor in my time to the equation?  should I base my prices on a specific amount of people that I forecast would want to use my services? </p>

<p>Total noob here, but I have a vision and the means to create it, just need help determining how to assign value to what I am delivering :) </p>

<p>What you are facing is a classic problem that has been present for ages, and no level of technology or computational prowess will solve it lol<br>
Your basic formula for your breakeven is (Company Operating Cost)/(Revenue). Where Company Operating Cost is everything, employees, hosting, developemnt, etc; and revenue is all incoming money from operations.
The only way to know for sure is to let the users decide.<br>
<strong>Starting off I would forget about making a profit, you'd be lucky to break-even.</strong><br>
Don't get scared by that statement, this is not only typical it is nearly guaranteed.<br>
<strong>You need to build reputation and customer trust before people pay even pennies for the service, meaning price very very low for the first year at least.</strong><br>
Any money you make dump into marketing.<br>
Once you start getting users, you can run metrics, play with various price levels and models and see where they lead.<br>
<strong>Metrics based pricing is the only way to know what users are and aren't willing to pay.</strong></p>
