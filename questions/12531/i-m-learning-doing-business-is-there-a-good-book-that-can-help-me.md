I don't think you can learn this effectively out of a book Jack. If people are making money out of this they will be doing it, not writing books.  There may be written stuff that can help you, but it will probably be on the net.

A more effective way to learn would be to approach someone who has been successful doing what you want to do, take them out for lunch and learn all you can.
