<p>We want to find a wholesaler who provides custom-made handbags and other related products. We are based in the UK, but obviously we're prepared to pay for delivery if we can find a wholesaler that can make products to our design.</p>

<p>Alternatively, are there cheap machines we can use to make custom handbags?</p>

<p>I've tried Alibaba and dhgate but I've not found any suppliers yet.</p>
