Can anybody that has used Google Merchant Center share his experience here? I am particularly interested in selling consumer software.

- What traffic do you receive compared to other traffic sources?
- Do you use Google Checkout or do you link to your website?
- Any statistics to share on conversion rate?

Thanks.

Google Checkout is a bit better for merchants than, say, Paypal.
PayPal usually is on the customer's side and you can get your account banned for no reason. This happens more rarely with Google.
However, people are used to PayPal which is sometimes a problem. My conversion rate went 23% up when I started offering PayPal as a payment method.
