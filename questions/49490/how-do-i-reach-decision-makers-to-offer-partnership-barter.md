I have already sent dozens of partnership suggestions and got 0 reply. 

My workflow:

 1. Get the list of the websites of companies that might be interested in my offer. 
 2. Look for contacts/twitter/facebook
 3. Write an email/twitt/leave comment on FB or paste the email text to the Contact form
 4. Wait, wait and wait...

The offer is our services as a complementary solution for their portfolio.
Few examples:
Contacted the CMS platform provider and offered our real-time domain/website malware scanner API as a "off-shelf" or the OEM. 
<br />Contacted shared-hosting offering API to be provided SaaS to the clients. <br /> Contacted ad networks, cloud companies and so on.

<br />We already have one big customer but from the web security business. And our services sort of complimentary. But even in this case, he contacted us. So I want to have more clients like him.

<br />I feel that my offer is really worth it and create, maybe not winning, but significant added value for potential partners. But somehow fail to even get a reply.

<br />Thoughts, suggestions and criticism(of course) would be appreciated.

In my opinion, there are 2 possible explanations:

 1. Your pitch is bad, people delete your email without reading it, consider it spam (especially since you're talking about security-related product).
 2. Your product is not interesting for them. 

One way to figure it out is to actually call your prospects instead of emailing them. If you can get somebody on the phone - they will at least explain why your offer is not appealing for them.
