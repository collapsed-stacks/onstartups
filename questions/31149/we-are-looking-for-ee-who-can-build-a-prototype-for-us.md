We need to build a device that will :

1) read electricity usage in the fuse box and sent it to transmitter in home and then to internet portal. ( similar devices: Alertme.com, onzo.com, www.greenenergyoptions.co.uk) I assume Zigbee between voltage reader and transmitter; WiFi in transmitter. However other options will be also considered (like HomePlug, Z-Wave, etc)

2) device connects with AMI smart meter through Zigbee which have enabled HAN (home-area-network) capabilities. And later send data through WiFi.

3) After analyzing data in internet portal, it send back the device instructions what lights to show (LED probably). 

Can somebody advice where we can look for professional who could build a workable prototype?
Or you think its better to find a company-partner to make a prototype?

What you want to do is **not** simple and the way to do it varries depending on what country you are in. Each country will have different electrical systems and regulations.

I **am** an electrical engineer, although I don't do this type of work. It's fairly easy to find a local engineering firm to do this kind of work in the US. But this is going to be an **expensive** project. What is your engineering budget? 

If you are in the US or Canada, this is **not** something you can outsource to some cheap firm in another country. Your measurement unit will have to meet offical regualtions, get certified, and be tested with **hundreds** of different kinds of electrical boxes. *(Even a few old fuse boxes.)*
