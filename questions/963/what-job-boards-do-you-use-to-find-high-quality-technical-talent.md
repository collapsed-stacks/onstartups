At some point, we all exhaust our networks and need to look externally for talent. We're planning to do some specific recruiting around front-end and "all-around" dev folks in the next few months and I wondered which job boards, besides Craigslist, you've found useful.

I'm particularly interested in those that attract "startup-style" people - those who are interested in the young company environment, equity, slightly more risk and the ability to have an impact vs. corporate jobs.

<p>We heard a lot of success stories with <a href="http://hiddennetwork.com" rel="nofollow">Hidden Network</a>, which <em>was</em> a blog-based job board. Our clients said that they had found some of their best developers through blogs, so I'd immagine you'd find some solid success with places like the Joel on Software board, which now posts on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p><a href="http://startuply.com" rel="nofollow">Startuply.com</a> is a fantastic resource.  </p>

<p>Startupers.com is pretty interesting as well.  </p>

<p>But to be honest, most people that I know go through connections, agencies, etc.</p>

I've been using www.partnerup.com and www.kitlist.org with some success.

CraigsList has been working well too although you get quite a bit of spam once you post.
