I've looked at some like Rally and VersionOne but those seem to be more enterprise software. I 'd prefer to just have a more simple one for our two-person team to track and build our mobile app product. 

I've seen Scrum'd and PivotalTracker, for example. What other ones do you recommend and why? Again, simplicity, web-based and speed of use are key. I really don't need anything more complicated than that.

<p><a href="http://agilezen.com/" rel="nofollow">AgileZen</a> is a rally spin-off that is much lighter weight (and cheaper) that the full-blown Rally product.</p>

<p>It uses a KanBan style of task layout, and the interface is very intuitive.

If its a two person team then most tools will end up getting in the way rather than helping. 

Most times people start off with a tool and fall back to the white board and post it notes until their teams grow over about 8-10 people.

I have also seen great whiteboard solutions for teams that are seperate ... they point a webcam at the board.

I tested in real conditions almost every Agile Project Management software out there, and no one beat my **good old (shared) excel sheet**.

Don't forget agility is *also* about being agile.

Go with a Google Spreadsheet. That way, people who are at home or offline can read it and update it. 

You can also use Google Sites within your Google Apps domain. They have templates for running projects, and they are very effective for small teams.

You might want to try Jira + Greenhopper:

Jira is a Bugtracker/PM Tool, Greenhopper a Jira extension for agile planning. I have used it and it was very nice to use and good looking. Each component has a cost of 10$. Please think twice if you expand your time to more than 10 people, prices changes then.

You can easily drag and drop your planningcard on the screen - it's a bit like a virtual whiteboard. Additionally you see burn down charts at one click. That is really helpful.
