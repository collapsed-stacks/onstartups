I have a corporate lawyer who billed me for about 4 hrs for a very simple trademark application (like 10 lines). Does this sounds excessive for a simple trademark application? 

This is the first time I've had one submitted.

Yes, you were overcharged.  I suggest contacting a small local law firm that specializes in trademarks, and getting a quote to file a trademark application.  Then send a complaint letter to the large law firm using the quote to show that you were grossly overcharged and demand that the law firm match that amount.  Big law firms discount bills all the time, so there is a good chance they will do it for you.

Note that there are many more steps to getting a trademark after filing the initial application.  After filing, your attorneys have to respond to numerous letters from the trademark office so there are more legal charges down the road.

That does sound like a lot of time, especially for something you can do yourself pretty quickly with a Nolo book. Did you get an estimate from him before you did this? And did he explain what he spent all that time on?

Lawyers and accountants are like auto repair shops - if you don't already have a good one you trust, it's always a good idea to get recommendations, ask for estimates, and shop around a bit. They're also like contract programmers: the ones who really know what they're doing may be more expensive per hour, but cheaper in the long haul because they can get the job done a lot quicker.

You can submit yourself with less hassle through a service called [Trademarkia](http://www.trademarkia.com) You know upfront what it will cost and choose the level of assistance you need. I found it very painless to do a search and lodgement

$1600 is certainly at the high end of what you'd want to pay for a federal trademark application but four hours isn't too unlikely if the law firm conducted a trademark clearance search. Also, did their legal fees cover the $325 USPTO filing fee? I work with startups regularly and assist with trademark applications at a flat fee but I'd say 1-3 hours per application is the norm. Each application (and client) is different. Online services like Nolo can be convenient for helping complete the application form but there's a wide range of related counseling that these services don't provide (e.g. registration includes the responsibility to prevent others from using confusingly similar marks, meaning you should expect to incur related enforcement costs in the future or risk losing the trademark). Find a good attorney and start building a strong lasting relationship. Your IP assets will be some of the most valuable your business owns so protect them as best you can.
