If two partners intend to start up a company but (before they have actually incorporated) they wish to make a large payment, e.g. to developers to build their product/prototype. Should the contract be signed by them as individuals? Assuming so, and assuming they incorporate during the development period, before the project is delivered, what additional paperwork is needed to assign the product to be owned by the company. Is another contract needed?

On the other hand is it better to wait for the incorporation before contracting with developers? (The downside there being the extra delay, before the developers can get started, so extra delay before they can get and use their product!)

(I'm asking this on behalf of a friend; the money for the initial development represents a big chunk of their initial capital investment into the company.)

Without a partnership agreement or contract there is no legal recourse in the case of a dispute. 

Also, harm caused by the informal partners toward the contractors can turn into a matter of personal liability.
