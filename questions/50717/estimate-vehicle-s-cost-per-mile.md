For a given vehicle I want to estimate the cost per mile, given the make/model, miles per gallon, mileage done, cost and future resale value, repairs and so on. The stumbling block for me is estimating repair costs, given the vehicle's age and mileage. Being a start up, the goal will be keeping costs as low as possible at the expense of time looking for good deals. Unfortunately my experience with vehicles are only that of a typical consumer. The challenge is :

  1. Finding a vehicle that has low cost per mile
  2. Use cost per mile (for a given annual mileage) to determine what to charge the customer

Ideally I'd want a website or app which has data on, for example, what typically goes wrong with a given vehicle, the frequency of those failures for a given age/mileage, and typical parts and labour costs for such repairs. Does this exist?  

If not, what might the next best solution be?

Thanks!

Have you looked at edmunds.com?  They have a True Cost to Own calculator that gives a breakdown of estimates on vehicle ownership, including repairs/maintenance.  And you can base it on the specific make/model/year of the vehicle.  It's likely the best data you will get.
