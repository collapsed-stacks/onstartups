For more than a year I have been working with a project/website/portal that would be really attractive to people if there was enough user using it. I am about to launch it but do not know how to do it right.

The problem is that without users it is not only boring to use (like if there we no users of twitter there wouldn`t fun to tweet anything), but also with lack of functionality, because it is providing content based on what other users have done.

*Unfortunately for my own reasons I am not able to tell my friends to join it and grow the user base in this kind..*
