There is no correct answer to this, but I would advise that you concentrate on your area of expertise, so that you don't have a massive learning curve.

If you have experience of business domains, then investigate B2B opportunities, otherwise go with B2C.

Personally, I think that B2B is easier, as people accept the need to spend money to improve efficiency, etc.
