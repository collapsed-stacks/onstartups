I'm wondering where can I find some examples of price quote sheets for offshore software outsourcing.

My company has been getting quote requests for work, but I'm not sure what's the proper way to quote prices, what terms to include in the quote, and the layout and presentation of the quote sheet.

Thanks!

I outsource 80% of my work offshore, and have learned a lot of this the hard way.  My advice, price quotes are not as important as quality of the work you get.  The value you get for work done differs greatly based on talent, culture and other variables.

We built an app last year that could not have been done offshore.  It required US specific knowledge about an industry where there would have been too many explanations and delays if we used our offshore developers.

What works for our team now is to hire developers offshore and place them on salary payroll.  This is about 50% cheaper than what we paid contractors from the same countries, but had increased productivity, helped strengthen our brands, team, and further has allowed us to incorporate our own company culture.

If you are looking to outsource work, make sure you know what you are getting into.  Small projects are easy, but big ones should be managed either on site, or by having a high level stake-holder manage the software offshore.

Contact some other custom development shops and see if they will send you a quote for something, this will get you started.

The issues are usually, time and materials. Are there any special materials needed? Special components, for example?

Remember to include a time-frame like 'This quote is valid for 30 days' so the buyer doesn't come back three years later expecting the same price.
