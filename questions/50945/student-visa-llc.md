A couple of weeks ago I had a classmate of mine pitch me his iOS application idea.

It was actually very good and I am ready to begin working on it with him however, there's an issue.

My classmate isn't a U.S citizen and is attending college with a student visa.

Would I have to register the LLC myself and then add him as a partner?

Looking for help on this matter.
