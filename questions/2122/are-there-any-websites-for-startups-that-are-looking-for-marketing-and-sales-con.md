I was wondering if startups don't have the marketing and sales expertise in-house (between the partners) and don't want to hire full-time talent, are there any websites that you can look for them?

If you haven't already, make sure to check out [What Blogs + Websites Have Provided the Most Help for Your Startup?](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/210/what-blogs-websites-have-provided-the-most-help-for-your-startup) and [What books do you recommend?](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/270/what-books-do-you-recommend), as both of those topics will give you a good starting point on where to look for information.

But I believe your best information will come from a good business coach: someone who knows enough about sales/marketing to get you talking to the *right* sales and marketing people. Out of all of the professionals I've worked with, sales/marketing folks were the most challenging to pick. I suspsect a lot has to do with the difference in each industry (marketing software vs. marketing widgets)

There is a good discussion on [How do you find good professional help?](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/1618/how-do-you-find-good-professional-help-lawyers-accountants-graphic-designers), and here's my two-cents on the matter:

> I always ask around - whether it's family, friends, or even the business next door. I also go to networking events to try to find contacts.
>
> Once I find a name or two, then I'll schedule an appointment and, if we seem to click, I'll open up with a small project. Maybe a contract review. Or my personal tax returns. Or a logo that's already been designed.
>
> It's simply a trial to show how well they work or don't work. And if they don't, then I repeat the process. Usually, the professional will do an acceptable job (otherwise, I won't pay) so, at the very least, you're only out time.
