We're looking to set up an Australian subsidiary for a UK startup to avoid local tax issues for our Australian employees (and to make it easier to hire them)? I've had a lot of experience setting up Australian Pty Ltds, but was wondering:

* Is there anything different (from setting up a regular pty ltd) we need to be aware of?
* Branch vs. subsidiary
* How do taxes that we pay locally for the employee flow up through the UK structure?
* Do we need to adopt UK company rules?

Thanks!!
