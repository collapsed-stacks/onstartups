I live in the UK and soon I want to register a **foreign subsidiary** of my Italian business. I will set up a limited liability company. Can I use my ***home address*** as a company address?
Thanks,
Aleksandra

I don't believe there are any legal problems with doing that, but if you rent your home, or you have a flat that you own leasehold, you should check the letting agreement/lease -- some of these (my own included) specifically ban you from using the address as the registered office of a company.
