**EDIT 1:**

So in short, is there a free way for me to get $1 from a customer and send that $1 to my bank account.  If free is not an option, what is the cheapest way for me to get that $1 to my bank account?  The customer will just pay $1, but if I get 10,000 customers, I will get $10,000.  It should be nice if I can keep as much of that as I can without losing too much in the transaction process from the customer to me.

**ORIGINAL QUESTION:**

I need to receive money from users from my webpage.  They will only pay very small amounts, i.e. $1 max, but the total will probably go upto $10,000.00.  What is the best way to receive this money from a webpage?  When I say "the best way", i mean a method of getting the money from where I lose as little of it as possible in terms of fees for receiving the money.

Try to sell bulk credits with larger monetary values and let your customers expend those credits on your product/service. See this thread on a similar discussion: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/13541/how-do-i-structure-a-payment-plan-for-my-website

Have a look at Paypal Micropayments - https://www.paypalobjects.com/IntegrationCenter/ic_micropayments.html

Micropayments are a good option, but the fees associated with them still take a good chunk.  Mobile phone payments are probably a more expensive option.

For transaction amounts around $1. your best bet is to build a credit system where you sell credits.  Sell 10 for $10, 25 for $20, 50 for $30 etc. 

Then use credits for what you sell.

Ok, how about you charge $2 instead PayPal ... OR $1 by USPS mail (cash or USPS money order)...they pay the fee.
