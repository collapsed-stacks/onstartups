I am looking for a template worksheet to help me do the following:

 - recording income/expenses 
 - budgeting
 - running basic analysis (e.g. week on week/ month on month numbers)

I have my own documents which I have been using, but I am sure there are much better ones out there. I think Microsoft had an online repository of such templates a while back, but I can't locate it.

Can anyone suggest a good resource (preferably Free) for such financial spreadsheets for both personal and business use (startup)?

Use quickbooks rather than spreadsheets. All of the things that you're asking for and a lot more are included.

<p>I've used this <a href="http://www.planningshop.com/products/elecWorksheets.asp" rel="nofollow">financial worksheet</a> created by Rhonda Abrams. I really like it and would recommend it. I bought it in order to create my financial statements for my business plan. It generates all the financial statements you'll need (balance sheet, income statement, etc), and even creates graphs for you. </p>
