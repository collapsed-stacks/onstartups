I'm thinking about setting up a membership based site where I design game website templates and allow the members free access to the templates as a paid member.

I see websites selling actual gaming website templates using the game's artwork and was wondering if this is even legal? 

What got me wondering about if this is legal or not I downloaded a fansite kit, however in the fansite kit was a pdf file that say's this:

> All materials contained in this “Fansite Kit,” including, but not
> limited to, any electronic files, code, audio or images (“Fansite
> Materials”), are the copyrighted property of Funcom GmBH, who grants

Can anyone shed some light on this?

Although I'm not a lawyer, I doubt you would legally be able to distribute the kit because according to the license, you are being given a non-transferable right to use it, meaning you cannot share it with anyone but yourself.

You might want to contact the creator directly and explain your situation that way they can decide on giving you a special customized license.

To do this legally you would need to find royalty free game graphics / code. To be safe/legal you would need to create this art and code yourself.

You could also contact these companies and pitch them your concept, if they are interested you could cut them commission checks based on sales or something like that.
