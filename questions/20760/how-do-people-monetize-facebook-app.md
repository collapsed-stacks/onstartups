This might be very simple question but how do people monetize Facebook app? Do they just display ad within their apps using Google Adsense or similar services? Does Facebook have a service to monetize your app?

Next time you go to do a facebook app's offer, look at the urls that load up in the status bar of your browser, and you will see the networks they use. The flash game apps usually get paid by impressions. Hurry the deadline for putting html on FB pages is in a couple weeks!

Also, is important to mention that, from today on, Google Adsense is no longer allowed to run in Facebook.  There is a list of Facebook Ad providers that you can find in http://developers.facebook.com/adproviders/
