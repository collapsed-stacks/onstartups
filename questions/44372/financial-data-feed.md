I am looking into writing financial charting software and am looking for the data required to get this going. The software will provide charting for any time frame for the entire inception of the equity. For example I need enough data to be able to calculate the open/high/low/close of every hour/half hour/5 minute/1 minute interval the stock has ever had.

Is anyone aware of a service/data feed/database that offers this kind of coverage?

There are a few like that:

- [NYSE TAQ](http://www.nyxdata.com/data-products/daily-taq)
- [One Tick](http://www.onetick.com/web1/onetickdatabase.php)
- [K DB](http://kx.com/)

Problem is this is costly and redistribution license would be even costlier.
