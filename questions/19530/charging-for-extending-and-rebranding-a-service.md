I have a public facing web application that a company have asked me to rebrand to them (host on their site, change name and logo to them) and also add some new features. The new features are a good idea that I have thought about adding in the past and so will roll them into my standard app. However, the new features were not on my priority list for the product. Is it okay to charge the customer for this development work but for me to maintain 100% ownership and IPR in the product and code? How is it best to pitch it to them? Is this a standard practice? Does it have a name?

<p>My company does this.  In our contract, we state very clearly that we maintain all ownership in the product, including any feedback provided by them about the product.  I would definitely charge the customer for any development work requested by them, and you could consider in your pricing that you will be retaining ownership. So yes, this is a standard practice.</p>

<p>The term "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product" rel="nofollow">white label</a>" is sometimes used for this.</p>

Sure. it is good for both - they get it immediately, and they do NOT get problems or pay for further development / testing / debugging long term,. And you can give them a sgnificant rebate (50%?) and name them as contributors.
