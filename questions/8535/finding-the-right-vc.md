I am looking for a VC that invests in the homeland security or access control industries...

Is there a website where I can search for VC's according to the field in which they invest?

I found [VCDB][1], which lets me search by location, but not by industry...


Thank you

<p>This site isn't the best looking, but it looks like it lists several VC firms investing in Homeland Security ventures: <a href="http://www.nationalhomelandsecurityknowledgebase.com/research/venture.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalhomelandsecurityknowledgebase.com/research/venture.html</a></p>

<p>Searching Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Venture+capital+firm%22+%22Homeland+Security%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=" rel="nofollow">"Venture Capital" "Homeland Security"</a> yielded both this and several new stories / articles that I think would point you to some more firms.</p>

<p>Of course, I'd still love to see a tool that lets you browse VC firms by investment sector, if anyone knows of one.</p>

<p>You can check out <a href="http://www.thefunded.com/" rel="nofollow">The Funded</a> or <a href="https://www.pwcmoneytree.com/MTPublic/ns/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">The Money Tree</a> or the CIA's venture firm <a href="http://www.iqt.org/" rel="nofollow">In-Q-Tel</a>. In-Q-Tel does specific homeland security and intelligence focused funding while The Money Tree will show you where the money is flowing and The Funded will give you an idea as to how well entrepreneurs like the VC firm.</p>
