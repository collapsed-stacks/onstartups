<p><a href="http://www.dancewithchance.com/" rel="nofollow">Dance With Chance</a></p>

<p>I can't recommend it enough. Every entrepreneur should read it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did no one see the subprime crisis coming? Does golf make you live longer? Why does the casino always win at roulette? What are the odds of a coconut landing on your head?</p>
  
  <p>Dance with Chance answers these questions and many more besides. More importantly, it shows us how to gain greater control over many aspects of our lives - by knowing just when to trust to luck.</p>
  
  <p>Written by experts for anyone with an enquiring mind, Dance with Chance will inform, inspire and entertain. In the meantime, this site offers a taster of this wonderful and timely new book.</p>

The last book I read (not counting those I'm in the middle of) was Making Things Happen by Scott Berkun. It was a great book on project management, which I think is important to anyone trying to run a business. The downside to it is that if you aren't involved in programming, then much of the book is too industry specific.

<p>Delivering Happiness by Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com. It's wonderful, and a book about building your business through core values, from the bad days to the heydays.</p>

Free by Chris Anderson

It tries to shed some light on the seemingly ludicrous freemium business model.  I loved it.

<p>I just finished <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1427798613" rel="nofollow">Word of Mouth Marketing</a> for the second time. It is filled with tons of marketing how-tos, to-dos, ideas, and examples. It puts a big emphasis on marketing to your existing customer base. Definitely worth the read.</p>
