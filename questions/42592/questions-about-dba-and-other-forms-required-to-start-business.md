I'm starting a small business (just me, no employees) doing graphics that can be purchased digitally and/or the originals mailed, as well as live graphic recording and graphic facilitation, and possibly teaching, training, and consulting. I would like to stay in the San Francisco Bay Area, but not in the city or county I am in now and will move once financially possible. I also plan to travel a lot, since my business would not be tied to a physical place. How to I know which forms to fill out (or the location of business to put on them) if I don't have a physical place or even a permanent working space now?

<p>You have to know.</p>

<p>DBA's are administered by local governments (usually <a href="http://business.ca.gov/StartaBusiness/RegisteringaBusiness/FictitiousBusinessName.aspx" rel="nofollow">counties in the State of California</a>). Your DBA in one county is meaningless in another. You have to DBA in any county you're doing (physical) business at.</p>

<p>Business licenses are issued by cities, so if you have a fixed location for your business - you should apply for the license in the relevant town-hall.</p>

<p>Entities (LLC's/Corporations) are registered at the state level, with the <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/be/" rel="nofollow">Secretary of State</a> (in California, each state has each own agency). They too require an address for the entity, but you can always update the address if it changes (or use a forwarding service/virtual office).</p>
