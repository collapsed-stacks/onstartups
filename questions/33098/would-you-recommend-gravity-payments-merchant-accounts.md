We're considering using CheddarGetter for processing subscriptions and using Gravity Payments as the Merchant Account. (One nice thing they are *willing* to do is deposit all the money in our account once per month. That makes our accounting a bit simpler).

We've used them for 2 months now and so far so good. The only thing they don't have (yet, it's coming this year they say) is international currency.
