After researching a lot my team came up with a number of educational organisations those do not have their own websites. We primarily design websites of all kinds.

So we have decided to send all of them a business proposal to design their websites. I am not sure what to write in the letter so that I can explain about our company and also impress the concerned person. 

a.should we mention the pricing scheme

b.how to convince them about the necessity of websites


sorry i forgot to mention that we are going to send the proposals via letters....not via emails.

Talk to them of the benefits that they will enjoy after owning a website.  As a business person myself, with no knowledge of technology.  I don't care of a website itself, or facebook or etc.  

I just care about how many hundreds or thousand of people I will reach with a website.  How will that impact my business?

You should tailor each message to the individual site you are emailing.  Otherwise you are wasting your time crafting a spam message that will be deleted upon arrival from 100% of the people you send it to.

I don't think they are ready for proposals yet. Start with a lower barrier to action, like inviting them to get a free consultation. Otherwise you are just wasting your time and money.
