I would like to locate an Angel in the Jacksonville, Fl area to pitch my idea to. Although getting funded would be great right now I am just looking for someone to critique my pitch so that I can work out the details and know what to expect in the future.

Any Idea how i can find an Angel in my area ?

Thanks

<p>What a great idea Steve-- to reach out to the local Angel community, test your pitch and begin to build some relationships that might be able to support and fund the launch of your business. </p>

<p>I reccomend that you take a look at <a href="http://www.springboardcapllc.com/" rel="nofollow">Springboard Capital LLC</a>. This is their discription:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Founded in 2002, Springboard Capital
  is an equity investment fund
  specializing in early-stage venture
  investments.  Springboard normally
  invests between $350,000 and $800,000
  in each of its companies.  Because
  Springboard typically syndicates its
  investments with "angel" investors and
  similar angel investment
  organizations, Springboard focuses on
  investment opportunities ranging from
  $350,000 to $2,500,000. </p>
  
  <p>As an investment fund comprised of
  over fifty private individuals,
  Springboard is flexible to consider
  investment opportunities in a wide
  range of industry sectors.  We focus
  on those opportunities that align with
  the experience of our investor
  partners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be sure --even for a test run that you have your "story" down. You don't want to have yor first impression be so raw you don't get another chance at all. There are lots of friendly faces here, and on different sites on the internet that can provide great feedback on tightening up your pitch!</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

In Seattle we have Alliance of Angels (AoA). You check if AoA has any chapters in your city.

Very few angels will actually take the time to give you proper feedback.  They just don't have the time.  Some are nice enough to do so, but unless they invest, they can't devote too much time to really understanding your business. 

There are much better other resources to give you feedback.  Some are friends, customers, your own intuition after running the business for a little while.

In any case, to find an angel in your area, google for something like "early stage equity investment in [area name]" but keep in mind that 90% of them live in Bay Area, LA area, NYC and Boston.  Some are in Chicago and Seattle.

<p>There are a few ways to get in front of angels.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/eKrzl8" rel="nofollow">www.meetup.com</a> has a range of groups that you could go along to</li>
<li><a href="http://bitly.com/gpMmxM" rel="nofollow">this week in startups</a>, if you could get on to this through one of the segments, you will stand a better chance of being approached.</li>
<li>Attend events like breakfasts (no idea why breakfasts) put on by your local government. If they are serious they are trying to find you as well.</li>
<li>We have state and federal government events like chamber of commerce, small business Victoria and a range of other events. </li>
<li>Go through your lawyer or other clients. Our lawyer knows a lot of people and puts on events and races so we can meet and have cool ideas that need his advice ... plus some great wine. Some of my clients have made it and are now bored, or put on events where their contacts are in that position. </li>
<li>10 years ago I met a 4 year client/angel at my parents Christmas party.</li>
</ul>

<p>... really, start at meetup.com or start your own ... move on from there.</p>
