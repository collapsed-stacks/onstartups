(1) Conversion Rate  Under the barebones AA docs, the idea is that if there's a 2-for-1 stock split of the common shares, then you should get twice as many common shares on conversion.  The rate is equal to the price originally paid divided by something called the "conversion price," which gets cut in half, or a third, or whatever, on a stock split.  It's a defined term in the Certificate.

(2)  A Firm Commitment Underwriting is when the underwriter (approximately) agrees to buy, and then attempt to resell, all the shares issued by the company in an IPO (or other public offering).  "of common stock" means that the company is selling common, not preferred stock in the offering.

(3) Two types of stock: Common and Preferred.  Investors typically get preferred stock.  The idea here is that investors holding a majority of the Preferred Shares can force the preferred shares to convert to common.  Why a majority and not unanimous?  Because unanimous means that a single small investor might be able to hold up a deal.
