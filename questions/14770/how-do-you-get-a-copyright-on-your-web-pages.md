In the United States and many other places, a copyright is automatically granted to the author of original work.  Trademarks and patents need registration.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_copyright_law#Registration_of_copyright

> Registration of copyright refers to

> infringement.

Registration instructions for the United States can be found at http://www.copyright.gov/forms/

Note that in the U.S. there is a **big** difference between the legal protections you get with an automatic copyright, as opposed to what you get when you register with the copyright office.

If you don't actually register the copyright you can't collect attorney fees or statutory damages for copyright infringement. In practice, those limitations make it almost impossible to sue someone for copyright infringement unless you register the copyright first. See a lawyer for details.
