This is a general question about dissolving an LLC in New York. I just want to make sure I go through the appropriate steps to have the company legally dissolved. This might not seem particularly start-up related, but the company being dissolved is in fact a tech start-up.

What I have found so far is:

1) New York Articles of Dissolution: http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/llccorp.html

2) New York Tax check-list: http://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/doingbus/ending_business.htm

3) US Tax check-list: http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Closing-a-Business-Checklist

Anyone know if there is more I need to do in order to legally and completely dissolve an LLC in New York State?

You have to (1) have a consent of the members and/or managers of the LLC, approving the dissolution (depending on what your LLC agreement says), (2) adopt a plan of dissolution (setting aside enough funds to meet creditors' claims), and (3) file a dissolution certificate with the NY Dep't of State.

Don't do this yourself- get a lawyer to prepare the documents, or at least try a service such as Interstatefilings.com, which is one of the most cost-effective ones around.
