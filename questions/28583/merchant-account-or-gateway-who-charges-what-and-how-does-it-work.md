I'm going to take credit cards over the phone/fax. That means I need some kind of virtual terminal.

I contacted my bank (Bank of America) and got following quote:

 - Set up: $130.00 
 - Monthly: $37.99 
 - Monthly Minimum: Waived 
 - Statement Fee: Waived 
 - RATES PER TRANSACTION: 3.1% + .25 (cents)

I was wondering:

1. What is Bank charging for service and what is First Data charge?
2. Is there alternative more affordable providers? I may need to process 1-2 payments per month MAX.. Authorize.NET was cheaper on all items but they don't have Merchant Account. Does it mean that BofA charges 3.1% for Merchant account?

<p>I think First Data would be who is really processing your transactions for BoA.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://feefighters.com/" rel="nofollow">Fee Fighters</a> to find better rates. I assume that if you are just doing 1-2 transactions they are big and the few questions they ask you will help you find the best choice based on your criteria.</p>

<p>Something like <a href="https://squareup.com/" rel="nofollow">Square</a> is also incredibly easy to sign up for and use with no monthly fees. The rate for swiping cards is relatively high at 2.75% but still even better than BoA. "Card not present" or transactions you manually key in are higher at 3.5% so that might not be worth it for large amounts.</p>

<p>Authorize.NET is not a merchant account but a way to take payments through your website. Is that what you need? A.NET is the most well known but there are alternatives there too.</p>

for the small number of transactions you are doing you can just use paypal.com
no monthly fees, no setup cost, just a pct per transaction

I use this company and I'm really happy:
http://merchantwarehouse.com/

We pay a $5 monthly statement fee, a $59/year security fee, then our transaction fees are lower than what is above.
