I'd REALLY really refer to an attorney because

  * this is VERY new
  * because of the above, even in case of any disagreements down the road, the USCIS will see that you put in a reasonable effort in getting real information for an actual attorney (vs forum comments)
  * Considering all the other risks inherent in any startup, do you really want to compound them by an uncertain foundation on immigration issues that put you at odds with the government? This is a risk you can control - so why not via a good attorney?

I saw a similar thread on Quora pointing to Jennifer Lee who seems to have experience in startups and EB-2 cases - exactly what you're looking for ! Details at http://www.linkedin.com/in/jyleelaw
