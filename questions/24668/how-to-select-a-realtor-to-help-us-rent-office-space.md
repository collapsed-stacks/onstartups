I need to select a realtor to help our small business find new office space for us to move to when our current lease expires.  I want to interview three and choose one from among them.  What questions should I ask them and what answers should I be hoping to hear?
Thanks,
Tim

<p>At the end of the day you want to work with someone who paints a realistic picture, is honest, and tells you what you need to know...........not what you want to hear.
Markets change and you need to make sure the person you decide to work with stays current on market trends.</p>

<p>A few questions you might ask:
I am a small business, do you have the bandwidth to provide the service level I need?  You are on a time schedule and need to get this done before your lease expires.  Make sure they commit to being able to help you and provide great service.</p>

<p>How long have you been in the commercial real estate business?  </p>

<p>Do you specialize in commercial real estate?  Be careful here.  I'm not saying a residential realtor can't do commercial, however it's hard to be a jack of all trades and be great.  Sometimes you want somebody that specializes and can focus on your needs.</p>

<p>Do you specialize in office space or do you have other commercial real estate specialties?</p>

<p>What types of companies do you typically work with?  Small? Large? Existing? Startups?</p>

<p>How many lease or purchase transactions do you do each year?</p>

<p>Do I need to sign an exclusive contract with you?</p>

<p>Are you the owner or broker of your company?  Make sure you don't get handed off to a new person who does not know what they are doing.</p>

Why not just use several? Why would you need to use just one?
