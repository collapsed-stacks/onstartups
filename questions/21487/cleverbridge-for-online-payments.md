We are looking at somone to handle online payments for us and we came across cleverbridge.
They seem like a pretty full featured solution, however they dont list pricing on their website.

Can anyone tell about their pricing and experience with them?
I am also willing to hear of any cheaper/better alternatives.

<p>There are a lot of alternatives. <a href="http://www.digitalriver.com" rel="nofollow">Digital River</a> has purchased many of the competing services and rebrands them as their won. Their prices seem a bit high.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fastspring.com" rel="nofollow">Fast Spring</a> has reasonable rates and great service. <em>(we use them)</em>. FastSpring has just launches a new monthly billing system for SaaS. <em>(It's still in beta so I can't provide a link)</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.plimus.com" rel="nofollow">Plimus</a> is another service provider with reasonable artes. <em>(we also use them)</em></p>

We use Cleverbridge and we are quite happy with the system.  Unfortunately I cannot disclose pricing but if you contact them they will tell you.

Cleverbridge has been built by the same people that built Share-It which was acquired by DigitalRiver a few years back. The Share-It founders then moved to start Cleverbridge.

If you're a small company Digital River have Commerce Express which is less than 6%.  I checked their dashboard and looks quite good.  

If you want I have a contact within Cleverbridge and also within Digital River.  Just let me know and I can send you the addresses for you to contact.

This answer will not help with Cleverbridge pricing... if that is all you need just contact them.  They are used by some very reputable firms.  I just couldn't get to "Why USe US" from their website. This is more general to experience looking at online payment processors and tying them into your web and systems.  I have looked at many of these providers... I looked at Cleverbridge briefly...(found them because at the time 6 months ago Flipbook was using them and I figured they likely had done their homework... (iPad app well funded) anyway we are a small software company and I stretch every nickel till it breaks.  We started with Paypal literally because cheap and easy to set up.  Yet I am looking to change that rapidly as I believe it makes us look cheesy...(Sorry PayPal and Peter Thiel... you are still a god for having the insight to start the company and sell it to eBay)  Anyway... we are likely choosing Authorize.net (owned by VISA), big but friendly and they seem very competitive.  The one caveat that may edge it out is Intuit Merchant Services... due to what I believe will be direct (or almost direct) import into Quickbooks.  Everything else I looked at was going to be arduous to get the sales data into the accounting system.  Depending on your business (mine is software).  Depending on volume a manual process of 50-100 transactions a day adds up.  It should be easier but the amount of information in a web sale and the online payment process is more complex than it first appears.  I started with "How hard can it be?"  Well that depends... but it gets pretty complex pretty quickly depending upon what you are selling.  We also use a low end shopping cart service call e-junkie, that will likely get replaced with Magenta(sic).  Hope that helps.  We are trying to stay in the 2-5% range if possible.  There is a lot of changes and competition heating up in this space.  Finally!

Cleverbridge is using personalized pricing based on your volume. Our volume is low and thus the pricing for us is a bit higher than we could get from other places. But the service is good and we are willing to pay that extra.
