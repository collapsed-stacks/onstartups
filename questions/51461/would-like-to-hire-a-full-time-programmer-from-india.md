<p>I'm looking to hire a full time programmer in India.  Of course he would need to pay tax in India.  But would I also need to pay tax in USA?  If I've got an LLC taxed as an S-Corp in California? </p>

<p>There are no tax implication for you in the US other than with any other business expense.  Since the developer will most likely be R&amp;D or capital expense, this will reduce your overall taxable income because you are using the developer to build your business.</p>

<p>You only pay taxes in the US for the income you generate.  Having expenses reduces your income so you pay less taxes.</p>

<p><strong>Sites to recruit developers:</strong> There are many freelance/project listing websites, e.g. odesk.com, elance.com or freelancer.com, that let you use your credit card to pay the developers on an hourly basis.  These sites also have feature</p>

<p>I think you should use a forum like www.elance.com, Not only you get a lot of choices but they guide you on the tax issues as well. Each company there has all the details of their past record so you are quite safe there.</p>
