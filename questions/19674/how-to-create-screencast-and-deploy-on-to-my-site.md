I am putting together a screencast to demonstrate the features of my software.

I am quite new in this realm of video editing and recording.

What tool is best to capture live screencast? It should allow recording of mouse moving and clicks being made. Also should allow labels to appear.

Which site is best to upload large screencast to? I was thinking of YouTube but I don't know how to make the youtube video that I will be embeding fill up half of the page (I want the screencast to be visible).

A couple of years ago I used Camtasia to create videos for one of my software products. It's pretty easy to use and has a free trial.

No experience with Camtasia, but in case you don't like it for some reason, CamStudio is also a fairly simple screen capture program (and free, which is always nice): http://camstudio.org/

You should:

1. Prepare a script

2. Record the audio - you can hire someone to do this, there are a lot of service provider can help you do profession voice over work.

3. Record screen according the your sound track

So the key is: Audio First! Because it's very hard to post-edit an audio track without introducing some kind of 'jump'.
