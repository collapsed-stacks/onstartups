<p>Let's say I want to start consulting.  I have a name in mind for my one-person business.  Can I just.... <em>call</em> it that?  Do I have to jump through any hoops to make it official?</p>

<p>In some jurisdictions, when the name you're using for your business is not your legal name, you're supposed to have it registered with the authorities as "DBA" (Doing Business As). This is so that in case you get sued, for example, your legal name can be matched to the business name by which you're known.</p>

<p>So if you're consulting as "Walrus the Cat", it is likely that somewhere you should register "Johny Walker Jr, DBA Walrus the Cat". Assuming Johny Walker Jr is your name.</p>

<p>In the US this is usually done at the county/State level, in counties/States where you work.</p>

<p>I wanted to expand briefly on the first answer posted. As a lawyer, I find that a lot of people are curious about the requirements for operating as a sole proprietor. </p>

<p>In response to your question, a sole proprietorship can operate under the name of its owner or it can do business under a fictitious name, such as Nancy's Nail Salon. The fictitious name is simply a trade name--it does not create a legal entity separate from the sole proprietor owner.</p>

<p>But like all businesses, you need to obtain the necessary licenses and permits. Regulations vary by industry, state and locality. Use the Licensing &amp; Permits tool on SBA.gov to find a listing of federal, state and local permits, licenses and registrations you'll need to run a business.</p>

<p>If you choose to operate under a name different than your own, you will most likely have to file a fictitious name (also known as an assumed name, trade name, or DBA name, short for "doing business as"). You must choose an original name; it cannot already be claimed by another business.</p>
