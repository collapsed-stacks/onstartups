I want to get a bunch of logod schwag printed as part of our promotional plans. Some of the things I want are:

Tshirts
Full size footballs
smaller nurf/soft footballs
other balls that can be tossed around an office
Tennis balls
and even foozies (from the bud light commercials)

Please let me know if you have had any good experiences, or have heard about a good printer.

Thanks a lot!

I would **shop locally**.

We have a great locally-owned apparel store down the street from us. They can produce silk-screened and embroidered items in very low quantities, but more surpisingly, they have access to everything I can find on the Internet. And not only that, they can consult with you to provide the best specific item for your need (I'll bet, for example, there are no less than 3 different maker of footballs). Even better, you can go in and see samples instead of ordering large quantities of [cheap crappy swag](http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Souvenir-Potpourri-A-Crapton-of-Candy.aspx#Aspose) (look for Aspose mousepads).

A couple years back, I had a few hundred mugs printed from DiscountMugs.com (the printer themselves) at what seemed to be a great price. I never would have guessed it, but later that year, my local store beat the price on the mugs, even though they were the middleman. They went to a producer that doesn't sell to the public. 

Support local business... get a better product... *and* save money. WIN!

<p>Like everything else, the cheapest place to get schwag is China.</p>

<p>We used <a href="http://www.globalsources.com/" rel="nofollow">Global Sources</a> to find webcams, and we got them on time with our logos and everything for $3.10 (You need to order several hundreds).</p>

<p>What is your budget?  How much schwag are you looking to buy?</p>

Check out Cafe Press http://www.cafepress.com/. We have used them before and they did a good job getting out stuff to us promptly.

<p>I agree with Alex and try to shop locally as much as I can but depending on the item sometimes buy online.</p>

<p>For logo item printing, I also worked with <a href="http://www.4imprint.com/" rel="nofollow">4imprint</a>.  They did a great job and were much cheaper than I could get here where I live.  They have a huge variety of items with many on sale items.</p>

We had positive experience with <a href="http://www.brandvia.com">BrandVia</a> a few years ago. They "aggregate" promo stuff from lots of manufacturers.
