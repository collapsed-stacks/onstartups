I use OldVersion.com quite a bit, and from what I can tell they operate within the bounds of the law. If you're a site that hosts other people's free software, what are good legal steps to take to make sure everything is clean?

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. 

It appears that OldVersion.com is simply using the same distribution model that download sites have used for years. Unless a particular application has a restriction that states that it shall not be distributed after a particular date, then OldVersion looks to the publishers like just another download site. 

(Aside - I doubt that an application that contains a restriction such as "shall be deleted from servers by this date" would be used or posted for download by anyone.)

To be completely safe you would review the license of every piece of software that you considered for inclusion on such a site and you would look for any terms that prohibit the hosting of the content.
