I am planning to start a business which is primarily based on talent search, recruitment and training.  While the talent search and recruitment will be for Executive to Manager level, the training will be for Supervisor to Executive level, primarily on sincerity, hard work, work culture, floor management, office tools, basic computer usage, etc.

I will begin with HR, Logistics and Production professionals first and then spread the talent search to other functions.

I need opinions, warnings and suggestions.

The business will be based at Pune and concentrating more in Maharashtra.

Just concentrate on one of your ideas. You are mixing up things, which might be build on one another, but concentrate on the most interesting for your clients to start with.

If this is talent search, do that up to the moment, when you see the possibility to engage the training market. Or do it vice versa. Starting in one or the other area depends on your market knowledge.

Don't start to broad/general, find a unique solution for your clients in one of the areas you are interested in. That means if you might start with HR, you pursue to provide best service in this area until you could expand to Logistics or Production. Find out what is the most important area for your prospective clients.

If you have no market knowledge, you may ask some businesses in your area about your intended service. However, don't overestimate what you learned. Try it then, if the answers are positive. Give it a few month in which you work steadily on it and see if it starts to take off.

Hope this helps. But next time, please ask a more specific question.

Two problems.

1. The description of the business is very vague. It can mean any number of things.

2. You're not asking a question. You're asking for advice on unspecified topics.

I suggest that in order to get high-quality feedback, you ask narrow and specific questions. It is my opinion that otherwise the best you can hope for are comments that while generally correct, are not relevant to your situation.
