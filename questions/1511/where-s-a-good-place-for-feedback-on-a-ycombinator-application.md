A cofounder and I are putting together a proposal/application for the Winter 2010 YCombinator funding cycle ([http://ycombinator.com/w2010.html][1]). We'd really like to get feedback, who are good people to ask? What have others done in the past when preparing their application?

You could simply post details of your application on Hacker News, this is the obvious community that will help you refine it.

Beyond the obvious; read everything Paul Graham has ever written.

If you find previous YC startup partners and ask *them* for advice, I bet they'd help you.
