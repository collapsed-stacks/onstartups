I want any Terms of Service dispute to be handled in the country where I live, that is, in Swedish courts. Given this, which ToS snippet of the two below is the correct one? I'm guessing it's the first one :-) ??

1:
> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with 
> the laws of Sweden, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, 
> and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Swedish 
> Courts.
>
> The proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to this 
> Agreement will be Swedish courts, with Göteborgs Tingsrätt (in 
> Gothenburg, Sweden) as first instance.

^-- This (alt. 1 "*exclusive* jurisdiction") means that regardless of where in the world a dispute arises, it must be handled in Swedish courts, and never never anywhere else than in Swedish courts, right? (And this is what I want to include in the Terms of Service)

2:
> Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the 
> non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden.

^-- This (alt. 2, "*non-exclusive* jurisdiction") means that in some weird cases, a party might request that a dispute be handled somewhere else than in Sweden, right? (And I therefore shouldn't use alt. 2)

Another question: Why would anyone ever use alternative 2? (Assuming alt. 2 is the "bad" one.) And risk a dispute in any court anywhere in the world?

You are correct that #1 would be considered better by the vast majority of people in your situation.

I can imagine limited circumstances where #2 might be OK, such as a large international company that is present virtually everywhere (thus, where a suit is brought does not matter much) and wants to treat its users / customers in a cooperative fashion.
