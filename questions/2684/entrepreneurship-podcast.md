Here is a podcast I found useful early on.  It walks through some basics and you can listen in your own time:

I would write this in a comment, but I don't have enough reputation to comment :-/

I think the initial reputation should be higher, or at least let people import reputation from or share reputation with other reputation based sites (based on the same engine).

<p>Relative to Entrepreneur related podcasts, I think that <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/" rel="nofollow">This Week In Startups</a> (TWiST) hosted by <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/about-jason/" rel="nofollow">Jason Calacanis</a> is a must watch/listen podcast. The format sometimes varies, but each show generally has a good guest plus the various segments like "Ask Jason", "Shark Tank", "In the News", and "Dead Pool" segments of the show are generally informative, insightful, and usually pretty entertaining as well.</p>

<p>The show is available on iTunes in both video and audio only formats, plus can be watched live (usually on Fridays 1pm PST) via <a href="http://ustream.tv" rel="nofollow">ustream.tv</a>.</p>

<p>Note: I have no association with the podcast, except being a fan who listens to or watches every episode.</p>

Listen to http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/ they have many great podcasts
also Stanford Social entrepreneurs and spokenword.org

There should be enough for many hours in those three links.
