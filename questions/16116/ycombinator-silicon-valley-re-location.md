I'm not a US Citizen and I live in Canada. I'm not a Canadian Citizen either. I'm in Canada on a Study Permit. I believe I have some ideas that can be turned into Startups and eventually into successful products. If I plan to move ahead with Y Combinator as my VC/Investor and if i need to move to Silicon Valley (which is a pre-requisite if you work with Y Combinator). How can I do so?

What minimum Visa/Immigration status would I need to enter US and run a business?

Thanks

<p>I believe that you will have a difficult time. In my experience, the two most likely visas for foreign entrepreneurs coming to the U.S. are E-2 (requires investment of a lot of money) and L-1 (intracompany transferee), and you probably qualify for neither. Please see <a href="http://dana.sh/diDRaK" rel="nofollow">Visa Basics for Foreign Entrepreneurs Coming to the U.S.</a></p>

If you are only coming for 3 months, and will not draw a salary, then you can come as a visitor, or apply for a B-1 visa, which is fairly easy to get (depending on your country of citizenship).
