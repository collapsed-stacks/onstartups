Now I work in a foreign trade company.We sell plastic machinery. The company has no factories. I contact buyers on alibaba.com. Clients may request to visit factories before they place an order. So we need to contact a factory beforehand. The problem is, when a client visits the factory, won't he buy a production line from the factory directly? You know, it will be cheaper if the client bypasses a middleman? Is it possible?

Do you bring any value to the table other than connecting the Buyer and the Factory?

If not then it seems like you're acting as a salesman for the Factory and you should talk to them ahead of time and say "hey, I'm bringing a customer to you and I need to be compensated for my time". (You may want to do that even with the option below).

If you do bring some extra value to the table that the factory lacks (like how to ship the products, how to test for lead <g>), etc. then that's your selling point.

A relative of mine has in contract help. The makes 30% of what is paid to the agency. The contract help has to sign an agreement that they won't "poach" those customers and sell their services directly.  You can do the same thing with the factory.

Look, if you're bringing lots of customers into this factory, they'd be dumb to kill the golden goose (you) that's bringing them "found money".
