How will I know when my company is ready to receive an investment?

I am starting a company and have bootstrapped it so far. I have produced four versions of the demo. The first fully-working version is underway. Getting this to a beta phase product will require capital, which requires an investment, which requires an investor, which requires I stop working on the product and go out and talk to people about it.

The last time I raised money from investors, it took a while but I was successful. I don't want it to take a while. I want it to be brain dead simple for an investor to understand the value so that I can optimize the time I spend with the product.

What is the best way to approach raising money, while limiting both my time and risk?

Any approach needs significant input and both business planning and salesmanship. If you can't be bothered with putting in the time to put together a business plan and sell your idea to an investor, no investor would be bothered with your business, as you obviously won't be bothered putting in the time to sell the product, and the investment will more than likely fail. 

Behind most successful technology businesses is a successful businessman, and behind every failed technology businesses is failed businessmen. The tech has little to with success, and believe me, investors don't really give a rats about the tech. What they care about is a business plan and ROI. 

Crowd funding..... sites such as kickstarter.com  may work better for you.

The best way that I have found through experience in funding others is to simply state the value of your idea.  Explain whether your concept is a "nice to have" or "need to have."  Most individuals when pursuing funds like to talk about their idea and the technology around it rather than the business itself.

Remember that the tech and product are probably really cool, but can easily be delved into later down the road.  What investors need to know is whether there is a strong enough team to accomplish the mission, if there is a large competitor base and if there is a potential for follow-on capital.

That being said, you mentioned that you need capital to go through a Beta phase. Investors like to see traction before investment, try and release at least some of your product in a Beta and that way you have feedback to show the money people.
