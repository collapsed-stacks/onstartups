## How can I split income with a person I never met?

I am currently working on a game for the Android devices with a person I found from a forum. I have never met this guy before and so far we have only talked on email.  He is from the UK and I am from Israel.

As we were discussing about the game, he proposed to split the income (if any) profit of the game 50% - 50%. Now as I think of it, how can I ensure such a trade? Is there any legal way we can simply split the profit without either of us running away with it?

The legal way would be called "a contract". Your problem would be with enforcing it. If either of you breaches the contract the other one will have to sue, and then the question is - where?

You should consult an attorney, but generally, you would be suing your partner in the UK (as he's a UK subject) and he would be suing you in Israel (as you're an Israeli). Given the amounts are small (hundreds, thousands of dollars?), the effort of suing will be enormous with regards to the damage.

So it all comes down to trust. If you don't trust your partner - there's no *real* legal recourse. You're unlikely to fly to North Yorkshire (or wherever) to sue him. Same goes the other way around - your partner is unlikely to fly to Mizpe Ramon to sue you (or wherever that is that you live). So you can safely screw each other knowing there's nothing much to do about it.

If the stakes are higher (tens of thousands and up), then you should probably have a lawyer draft a contract, and meet.

You should meet anyway. If only for a beer and getting to know each other. London is marvelous this time of year.

The question for me is not how you can split it but more why you want to split it with this particular person?

As littleadv has already pointed out you have no realistic legal recourse and you don't know the guy so why take the risk? Find someone closer to home who you can meet, talk to, get to know, visit their home, meet their family and, most importantly, have a much easier legal route if things go wrong.

If you do go ahead then think long and hard about banking arrangements - insist on an account which will not allow debits from the account without both of you agreeing to it and signing. If that seems like too much hassle, then see my point above!

<p>It's not possible / reasonable to comprehensively answer your question. It's too wide open.</p>

<p>The <em>distance</em> between you isn't a problem. You should meet up and get to know each other, but contracts can just be post-mailed or signed, scanned and emailed.</p>

<p>As @littleadv says, you will certainly want one or more written contracts. But money has a way of bringing out the worst in people, and if your partner starts cheating, your enforcement options might be very weak.</p>

<p>If money might become involved, then you should also look at forming a corporate structure together, with both of you as part owners. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company" rel="nofollow">LLC's</a> for the limited liability, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation" rel="nofollow">incorporation</a> for limited liability and much more. Also have a look at some of the <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/tags">past discussions on our site</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the issue of taxation is a real sticky one. With the two of you in different countries, some setups might be much more tax-efficient than others. And surely, if you incorporate in one of the countries you live in, then he who lives there will have it much simpler when it comes to filing tax returns. Again, answering cross-border tax issues is too wide open to do correctly now.</p>

You should be able to pick one jurisdiction or the other (either the UK or Israel) and have the contract have to be enforced there, meaning that you can pick where either of you would have to file a lawsuit.

However, the costs of enforcing any breach of the contract would be expensive and could outweigh your profits.  So if you want to split profits 50/50, I wouldn't count on a contract protecting you.  Maybe set up a joint bank account and have dual signatory authority over it or something; think in non-legal ways about protecting yourself.
