Where does one do research on small to mid-sized companies (e.g., prior to making a sales call for instance)?

Besides their own website, twitter feed, or other content generated by them, where else can information be found?  Hoovers.com, alexa.com, etc. are great for large companies (for finding competition, demographics, etc.) but what about for small to mid-sized companies?
