I see some people making money from selling ebooks and they doing pretty good. When I look at the titles, I know I can easily get the same information by doing some research & reading using Google in a few hours. It can be just like clicking on 5 links!

It seems there's a large segment of people who are lazy or incompetent or don't know how to search or just don't know better. I guess the sellers are selling convenience.

Was there a question in there?  I'm going to assume it was: **How can people sell eBooks when the same information is available from a few hours of searching?**

1. Because paying $10 for the answers instead of 2 hours of searching means you value your time greater than minimum wage.
1. Because you can't trust random info you find on the Internet, but generally eBooks are backed by someone with some kind of reputation to protect.
1. Because eBooks are often written better and more complete than random stuff on the Internet.
1. Because collating and interpreting information is useful too, not just searching and finding lots of information.
1. Because once a blogger has a lot of readers who like them and trust them, even just packaging up the "same old stuff" as an eBook is an opportunity for their readers to give back.

They make better gifts (maybe in the form of an Amazon card) than a bunch of links to free information.
