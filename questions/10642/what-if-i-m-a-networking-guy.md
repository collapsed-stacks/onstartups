What do you feel about the structure of my startup,  where my co-founder is good in both product development and marketing; whereas I more of a face-to-face networking biz dev guy?

Do you think we can make a strong team?

How do you think I can complement my partner?

It depends on the type of startup. If your business sales directly to customers (e.g. b2b enterprise software) and if your business needs to partner with some manufacturers/service providers - then the 'networking' skill is important.

It is also important for doing Customer Development, but I tend not to overestimate it. It's certainly good to 'get out of the building' to speak to the customers, but if you are planning to sell your product/service through the web site, you have to design and build your sales channel with 'automated' sales in mind from the very beginning, and face-to-face meetings probably will not help in that case.

Several notes:

 - If you have to ask, that's a bad sign.  Startups are hard enough without worrying about who is pulling weight.
 - Startups are about revenue.  If by "face to face biz dev" you mean specific ways to get revenue and customers, then how could that *not* be valuable?  But if you mean you're good at golf but not closing sales or making stuff, then no, that's not a valuable skill at the beginning of a company.
 - There's always an infinite amount of work to do at a startup.  If you feel you'll be busy from morning to night for the foreseeable future, that sounds good.  If you feel there's not enough work for "biz dev," and the other guy will have to do the rest, that doesn't make sense.
