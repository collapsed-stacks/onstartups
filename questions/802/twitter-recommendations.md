I liked [this question][ref], and I felt that the answers were valuable, so I thought I'd ask one along the same lines.

Which Twitterers do technology entrepreneurs find most valuable?

I'm following [@Wired][wired], [@TheCloudNetwork][cloud], [@TheBPMNetwork][bpm], among others.  And oh yeah, I recently started following our host, [@ASmartBear][jason]. :)

PS /meta/ Bummer, I wanted to tag this as "twitter" and "socialnetworking", but I can't create tags. :(

I like:

 - http://twitter.com/dharmesh - runs this site but otherwise also has good tweets
 - http://twitter.com/fredwilson - VC with good tweets
 - http://twitter.com/ericries - lean startup

Additionally, follow other entrepreneurs.  It's great to hear their success and failures.
