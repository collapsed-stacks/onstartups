If the parent company wholly owns the subsidiary, could the employees of the subsidiary work on products of the parent company? Are special contracts needed?

Thanks

<p>Yes. Think of it; plenty of multinational companies have development centers all over the world.</p>

<p>Yes, and this is much too situation-specific and complex for Answers.OnStartups. In general, you would need some kind of framework around <em>a)</em> transfer of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks etc, and <em>b)</em> transfer of money, including taxation issues.</p>

<p>Most young startups sidestep these issues by not creating a subsidiary .. just hire a service provider (an <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/outsourcing">'outsourcing' company</a>) in the remote destination, and buy a service from them.</p>
