## Is it ok to present a different pitch deck than I emailed?

I just finished a pitch deck (11 slides, with 25 slide appendix), knowing that I'll often be emailing the deck to investors to read. So it's mostly text. I'm pretty sure that if I present at a live pitch with this deck, it'll significantly detract from my presentation. I imagine the investors just reading the slides. I want to make a much more basic deck for presentations that is mostly graphs and/or pictures with very little text, so the audience focuses on me and what I'm telling them. Is this ok to do?

Absolutely. As a potential investor, I'd expect you to do this and would frown on a full text presentation. The less text the better. Speak and speak well.

Yes, it's totally OK to do this. I haven't thought about it before, but it's an interesting idea to have one deck to email and another one to present.

Either way, you need to dump the deck with 36 slides that's mostly text. I doubt that investors will ready them. Try to par that one down to 10 slides or so and make sure it doesn't have too much text in it. Investors don't have the time or the patience to read 36 slides. Here are some links to sites about successful decks
