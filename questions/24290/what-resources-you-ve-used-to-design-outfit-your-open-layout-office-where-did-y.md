I am looking at possibly moving my company to another office space. We will do open layout again, since it works for our culture (even CEO does not get a private office).

My budget does not really allow for hiring and architect or interior designer. So I want to get some ideas from your replies and blogs/sites you may point me to.

Team so far came up with ideas of using corrugated clear plastic panels to separate desks. Possibly use some old doors covered with plexiglas for conference room table. Ideapaint instead of whiteboards.

Would really appreciate if you share some links to blogs and possibly examples of how you did your cool office.
