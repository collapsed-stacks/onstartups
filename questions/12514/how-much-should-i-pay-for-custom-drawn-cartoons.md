I am thinking of using some cartoons as part of some marketing, but I need some idea of how much they may cost.   I also need to find someone to draw them.

Sorry I know I am asking “how long is a bit of string”, but has anyone got any ballpark numbers?

What website should I be asking this question on?

<p>You could do a couple of things to get the answer to your question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Post a brief on elance.com or 99 designs or another freelancing website and see what response you get and how much people are willing to design cartoons for. They may also tell you what they need in terms of a brief.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask a question on a design/cartoon forum.</p></li>
<li><p>Use syndicated cartoons. I know Jason from Smart Bear uses cartoons on his blog. You can see them and find the source <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/pattern-seeking-fallacy.html" rel="nofollow">here:</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

Further to Susan's Point #1. When you post a job remember to charge for complete project instead of hourly rate. This will get you more reasonable bids. If your unhappy with the feedback then modify the price and try again.

Thats a much better way of understanding the costs and also finding a designer. You can hit two birds with one stone.

Best of luck,
