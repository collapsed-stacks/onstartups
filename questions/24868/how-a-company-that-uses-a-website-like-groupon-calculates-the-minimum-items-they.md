I have the intention of giving a try at one of those group buy like businesses that you can get prepared for you and start selling in your neighborhood or village. I understand, how the hold idea works, but i am confused with, how to design the offers. I will explain:

This is how the interface for creating deals of most of the sites of this type look like:![enter image description here][1]

What confuses me is:

**-how can i know what is the minimum orders that this deal needs to pass?**

**-How can i calculate that? Lets take the parameters passed bellow as an example.**

**The value of Min Orders must match your return on investment expectations.**

If you want cash, be sure that min orders will assure you cash.

If you want visiblity, be sure that min orders will bring you many people with not too many loss.

Min Orders is very important and should be set with objectives in mind.
