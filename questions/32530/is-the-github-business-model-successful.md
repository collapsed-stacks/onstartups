GitHub has an amazingly simple business model: free if you are public (open source), not free if you have stuff to keep private (closed source).

I'm thinking of applying the exact same business model for my startup. I fear however that almost everyone will use the free version.

Has the GitHub proven sucessful? Are there other services that follow the same model?
