Looking to get some SEO work done on our new website. Seems like a bit of a mine field. Can any one please recommend good companies that you have experience of working with (and if you don't mind the websites that they have worked on)

<p><strong>I'd recommend <a href="http://www.distilled.net" rel="nofollow">Distilled</a>.</strong>  I've attended several events they have put on, they work closely with <a href="http://www.seomoz.org" rel="nofollow">SEOMoz</a> in the US and from hearing them speak I know they know their stuff.  We have an in-house SEO team but if we didn't, I'd approach them first.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/replicate-googles-panda-questionnaire-whiteboard-friday" rel="nofollow">this video by the founders of both Distilled and SEOmoz</a> - gives you a flavour of what these guys are like.</p>

I have not worked with these guys http://www.sitevisibility.co.uk/ but they've built up my trust from their podcasts http://www.internetmarketingpodcast.org/ which are useful and not at all self promotional. 

They have some decent size clients too.

<p>you might have good experience up north with the likes of <a href="http://www.epiphanysolutions.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Epiphany</a></p>

<p>I know a friend who works there, no other relation to them,  but check their work for yourself :)</p>

We used http://bazookasearch.com/ for quite a while when we first started working on OVIA. These guys got us from page 8 to page 1 (#1 for company site and #3 for company blog) in a matter of weeks. If you search for "video interviewing" the company site (Inovaz) still ranks very high - #3 on page 1 (even though we stopped the campaigns a while back)!  
Will definitely recommend them! Hope this helps.
