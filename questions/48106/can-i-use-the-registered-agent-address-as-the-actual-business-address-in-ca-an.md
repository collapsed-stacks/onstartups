When using web services such as bizfilings.com to file articles of incorporation, they provide free registered agent for a few months. The articles for incorporation using these services ask for "actual business address." Since these services do not provide registered agent address when one is in the process of completing the form, is there a way one can use agent address as the "actual business address"? 

In other words, the registered agent address is not available until articles of incorporation are filed, thus rendering them unusable as actual business address. How could one use them as actual business address?
