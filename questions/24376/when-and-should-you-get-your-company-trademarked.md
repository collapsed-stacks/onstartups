When and should you get your company TradeMarked?

I heard that you shouldn't Trademark your company unless it is making money.
What are potential benefits of trademarking your company?

Thanks for all the help.

Hope this helps all other entrepreneurs that are thinking about trademarking.

Edit:
I am in the USA, Rhode Island.

<p>The real question is whether you should <strong>register</strong> your trademark.  Getting a trademark is easy.  Under the common law, you get trademark rights simply by using the mark in commerce.  If you sell Kung Fu cookies, then you have a trademark rights for the trademark Kung Fu for selling cookies (unless someone else started doing it first).</p>

<p>The USPTO provides a nice <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/register.jsp" rel="nofollow">summary</a> of when you should register your trademark.  If you are selling a product only locally (e.g., you have a cookie store) then you could consider registering your trademark with your state for similar benefits.</p>

<p>You are correct in that a trademark is not as useful to a poor company.  Even if you have a registered trademark you still need to pay lawyers to enforce it for you.</p>
