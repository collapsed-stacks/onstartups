I sell a software which I registered with some download sites. They generate a lot of traffic in downloading and distributing the demo but don't generate much visitors or sales in relation to this. My conversion rate from google searches is better by far.

I did not find hard facts on this but some opinions on the net. Is there any hard data to the  relevance of this sites for software sales? Or do you have a totally different experience?

Amenti - the primary reason for spreading software to download sites is purely for the SEO.

Every marketing channel (we call "profit machine") has to have it's own conversion numbers and prove it's own profitability. 

Ignoring the SEO aspect of having your software on these sites, the question is...  Have you got 1 sale from these free sites?

If yes... that's a good formula. Can you rely only on this channel? Well that depends on how much money your making and if that is good enough for you.

If you say "I don't know"... then you need to starting tracking traffic sources and conversions.

If you say "I can't track" or "it's too tough" or "I don't know"... I'll say ... better stop doing business on the web until you can. (OK harsh... but hopefully you get the idea).

In my book ... if you can't track it... you don't do it.
