I've just been reading a book by Rob Walling titled "Start Small, Stay Small" and I came across an interesting idea (one of many he has in the book). I wondered what people on here thought.

My software application (an employee training records regisiter called Training Manager) isn't finished yet, but I want to generate some leads that are interested in the software. The idea is to create a sales website (I currently have a coming soon website for my company called [Smart Company Software][1] that I want to replace) that lets people know about the product, perform some adwords tests and then when they click the download or buy button they are told that the software isn't quite finished and if they leave their email address they will be entered into a draw to win a free copy of Training Manager.

Some people may say this isn't a good approach to deceive customers, but I think it has merit and wondered how other people viewed it.

What I did prior to my first alpha being ready, was to put up a survey that told people about what my software would do and asked them what features they'd like to see in it. Then if they are interested in getting an email when the alpha is out, please leave your email.

I also responded personally to every survey submitted.

Over several years, I had a mailing list of 1,000 people, all interested in my product when my first alpha came out.
