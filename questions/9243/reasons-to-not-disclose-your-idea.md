It doesn't appear that this site looks at it as spam. Is there a strong fear of having it stolen? It just seems like the feedback would be improved.

Are people this protective in the real world?

<p>Some of the main reasons would be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As you say, the idea may be stolen. But that actually counts for less than people think. Take a look at <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6131/protecting-my-idea" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>. It's the execution that has real value.</p></li>
<li><p>(definitely true in my case) The person may still be a newbie and/or may not have fleshed out the idea enough to defend it or make convincing arguments about its value. So he/she might be reticient about publicizing it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for the real world, people are definitely more open. I was at the Silicon Valley Co-Founders Meetup last Thursday (hosted by <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/users/502/alain-raynaud" rel="nofollow">Alain Raynaud</a>). There was a LOT of frank and open discussion about ideas, because the raison d'etre of the Meetup is to be able to locate Co-Founders for <strong><em>your</em></strong> startup.</p>
