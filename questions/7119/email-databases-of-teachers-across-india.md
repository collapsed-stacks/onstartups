<p><strong>Stop!</strong> That's called <em>spamming</em>.  Your prospects should <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html" rel="nofollow" title="Seth Godin: the marketing master">opt-in</a> to receiving emails from your website.  Therefore, you need to get people to website.  </p>

<p>You can get people to your website by:</p>

<ul>
<li>writing a blog (perhaps on the company website) that benefits your potential customers</li>
<li>networking face-to-face</li>
<li>writing a free ebook "report" (internet marketers live and die by this)</li>
<li>commenting on blogs/facebook/twitter/websites that have potential customers and linking back to your company website</li>
</ul>

In the west schools are notoriously hard to get into and requires a methodical process to getting inside the door. An e-mail campaign using addresses from a list will likely be ineffective. 

This could be an opportunity to use a low tech, less intrusive yet potentially high value strategy. 

Step 1. Pick 100 of your favorite schools

Step 2. Write a physical letter explaining:

 - Interest in programs\pedagogy\technology (you decide on the specifics
 - Interest in speaking to a teacher at the school who is the "expert" on such matters
 - In return you would like to highlight them in your soon to be launched newsletter
 - Provide a contact address and remind them you will call in x amount of time to follow up

Step 3. Call the school, mentioning the letter, and build the relationship.

Step 4. Use the information gathered to feed back into your newsletter.

It is a rough formula and should be customized to your needs.
