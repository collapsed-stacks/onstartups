we're a small startup that filed an intent-to-use trademark for the name of our app which will be releasing soon. 

Another company has offered to buy us out or buy the rights to our trademark (neither of which we would like to do). They have already started to use this name in promotions and they will likely use it soon for commerce (most likely before us). They have millions in capital and can afford to hire lawyers to battle with us. They are also in the process of buying the .com (we own other domain extensions).

Do we have anything to fear? Can they force us to change our name? If possible, can we force them to stop using it? 

Thanks for the help!

Three words: 

Consult a lawyer. This issue is too important to make a decision based on the info you get here. 

Good luck.
