Our startup's name is "Name LLC" and we're being nitpicky about it in hindsight and want to add the comma in there legally and recognized in the state's documents so it appears as "Name, LLC".  What form do we file?  The Certificate of Amendment (LLC-2) or Certificate of Correction (LLC-11)?

Certificate of Amendment, because you changed your mind concerning the name - you are not correcting an error.
