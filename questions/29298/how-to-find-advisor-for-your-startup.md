We are very early stage startup with protoype in the works. We need and advisor on raising financing, and marketing. Just wondering how do you go about finding someone and then ask them to be your advisor. 

Do you pay advisor equity or cash?

Thank,

In no particular order for finding:

1. Business Networking Groups.
2. Referrals from local business professors
3. LinkedIn
4. Referrals from other start-up companies 
5. SCORE (Senior Corp of Retired Executives)
6. Referral from the capital source you hope funds you
7. Local bank
8. . . .

For Asking:

After at least two meeting and in person: "My partners and I would be interested in engaging your serivices in an advisory capacity. . ."


On payment: You will get what you pay for.
