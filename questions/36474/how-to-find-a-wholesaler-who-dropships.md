I am currently working on creating a dropshipping site and i would like to sell core electronic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.) but i am having trouble locating a wholesaler. I was wondering if anyone could help point me in the right direction or even just give me some general info on how to find wholesalers in general who would be willing to dropship.

Considering the size of the components and that the cost to ship them would probably be more then cost of components by themselves it doesn't surprise me.

I would start with some of the wholesalers and see if they would be willing to do the dropshipping for you like:

 - [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/)
 - [4 Star Electronics](http://www.4starelectronics.com)

And while that's fine I would suggest contacting manufacturers directly like: 

* [Maxim](http://www.maxim-ic.com)
* [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com)
* [National Semiconductor](http://www.national.com)

And simply get the list of their distributors or even see if they will dropship their own products.

I buy electronic components and virtually all of the places that sell those parts have a minimum order price **and** a minimum quantity for each item.

Do a simple test. Figure out what your typical order, minimum order, and maximum order would be for your projected web site. Now try and find a parts supplier who will sell you only what you consider a minimum order would be through your web site. If you can not find a part supplier who will sell you that small of an amount, then you are not going to find anyone to drop ship it for you.

Now try out your typical order size. Is there any parts supplier who will sell that to you. If not- your entire business model is based on a bad premiss. In that case you would need to give up on the drop shipping idea and do the shipping yourself. And then you will discover why no parts supplier will sell small amounts.

Generally in business you will find that 1,000 orders for $1 each are not equal to one order for $1,000.
