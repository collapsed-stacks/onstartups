## Site/Training turned out to be with the same name as a book?

I set up a website and training with the name “The Art of Making Friends”
I am also thinking of selling DVD under the same name.

It turned out that it has the same as a book (not mine of course): [Networking: The Art of Making Friends][1].

1) Would it be a problem for me?

2) As an alternative.. what if I select a trivial name like “How to make friends” that anyone can use ?

Thank you

<p>I am not a lawyer, but there should be no problem having a website or a blog with the title "The Art of Making Friends". There should also be no problem publishing a book or DVD with the same title. See this <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080717115755AAFqFqA" rel="nofollow">link</a>.</p>

<p>That said, in America at least, anyone can sue anyone else for any reason, even if there is no legal basis. If might not hurt to approach the original author and try to become friends before you try to publish something with the same title. If they know who you are then they might not take it personal.</p>

Unless it's a trade mark, you are safe. It's not lengthly or "different" enough to be protected by the copyright.

So unless you want to be unique and avoid confusion that may affect you as well, you can keep the name.
