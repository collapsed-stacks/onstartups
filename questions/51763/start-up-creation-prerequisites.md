<p>I am looking for guidelines on: "How to make my own start-up?."
Which are the preliminary steps that i should be aware off? What should  i avoid and what to persuade?
The question might be a bit vague, however i would like to hear more on the above topic.</p>

<p><em><strong></em>**Edit*</strong>:<em>*</em> So  taking under consideration the following scenario, what would it be the recommended course of action?</p>

<p>I am a developer and so far i have done a couple of projects. At the moment i am self-employed and i would like to expand the work that i do by doing it a business of some shorts.</p>

<p>I am expecting that will need a brand, a name for my start-up company. Whats should i do in order to promote my services.? Is social media the edge of marketing atm? Moreover, living in a European country, what would it take by means of official and/or legal papers, initial budget etc., to start working with and secure the "uniqueness" of what i do.??</p>

<p>I am an utter nab in this field. Therefore do not hesitate to answer my question in the way you feel like it. Any feedback or tips are welcome.</p>
