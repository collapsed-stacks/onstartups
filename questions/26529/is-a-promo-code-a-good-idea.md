## Is a promo code a good idea?

I'm getting ready to "relaunch" my site.  The site currently sells royalty-free Silverlight controls by independent developers (sort of an iStockPhoto business model).  I'm working on a massive redesign, and I'm adding illustrations to the mix in order to attract designers as well.

I've already contacted a few bloggers asking if they'd be interested in writing something short about the site, and I'd include a promo code they can share in order to attract new contributors.  The promo code would increase the payout percentage through the rest of the year.

But now I'm wondering if this is a good idea.  Or would it be just as beneficial if I simply provided the increased rate to all contributors, and simply forget about any promo codes?

Why complicate your launch... I would do away with the promo code and provide the increased rate to all contributors. If you really want to differentiate, setup some sort of tiered affiliate program that would manage payout amounts and percentages.

Are you focused on the right issue?

At the moment you have a handful of contributing developers, something in the region of 10,000 views, decent (room for improvement, though) download:view ratios on free controls and no purchases that I can see.

Based on what you already know, more eyeballs <> more revenue. More contributors <> more revenue-earning contributors. More revenue share for new contributors = upset existing ones and promise new ones what you can't deliver.

You need to focus on the core issue: how to turn visitors into customers. If developers are going to hire you as their sales channel, you need to be able to sell.
