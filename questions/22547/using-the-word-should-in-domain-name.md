I'm deciding on a domain name and I like one, however it has the word "should" in it.  
Do you know of any reason that would be a problem ?  

Like people not being able to spell it or any such ?  

Asking here before taking the plunge 8-)

You might lose a few from the txt spk generation, but aside from that I can't see it being much of an issue.  On the plus side at least there's no variation between English and US English spellings unlike colour/color etc.

If you think it works for your branding, go for it.

I don't see any issue with the word "should", it's a basic common word in the English language. If a potential visitor can't spell the word "should" and you've got a paid product on your domain, you probably don't want that rubbish traffic anyway.
