Is it possible for an S-Corporation to have negative tax liability or will it just be clamped to zero?

Yes, since the S Corp is a pass through entity the gains or losses are reported on the K-1 form and entered onto your 1040.

You should speak with a CPA.  S-Corporations are pass-through entities, so reporting negative tax liability probably throws up a ton of red flags and will get you audited.

Without knowing the details of your situation, it's best to take it up with a CPA to go over it with you.
