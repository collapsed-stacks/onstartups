just a quick question - I know there are many companies online that compare business insurance quotes - which one is the most reliable one? Which would you recommend?

Also, when signing their contract online, do I need to use a certain software? I know not all signatures are legal and acceptable by law, what should I do? Can you recommend the right tools?

Thanks!

Depending on your industry, I used techinsurance.com last week with good result (after waiting 2 weeks from my traditional insurance broker).  They were cheap and efficient (2 days from initial form on the internet to getting an insurance certificate).  If you look around they have a really good reputation too and represent large insurance companies, so they are trustworthy.  They've been around for a long time too (> 10 years).

As far as signing docs, they emailed me a form, I signed it, scanned it and then emailed it back to them.  Fairly painless and I could have faxed it if I really wanted to.
