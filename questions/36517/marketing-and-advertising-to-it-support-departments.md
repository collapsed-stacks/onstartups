Does anyone have any good resources or suggestions on how to market and advertise a software tool to IT / Support departments?

We're trying to move our startup "Beyond Adwords" to get our product in front of the folks who would buy IT support products.

Are there any:

   - Websites
   - Blogs
   - Magazines
   - Channels

... or any other resources on how to get the word out about our product for this space?

You can't market to a department. You need to market to people. This may sound pedantic, but you'll find it much easier to find and target potential customers if you think about them as people, what do they like, where do they hang out online/offline etc.
