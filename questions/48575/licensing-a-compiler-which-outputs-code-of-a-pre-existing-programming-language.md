## Licensing a compiler which outputs code of a pre-existing programming language

This is a cross-post from stackoverflow; I was told you guys might be more knowlegable in this area...

I have an idea for a project which, ideally, I would like to eventually make money from.

Without getting into explicit detail, I am planning on developing a language which - when compiled (not sure if this is the correct terminology) - produces one or more known programming languages, such as (for example) Java.

Are there legal restrictions I could run into? Say I release this "solution" free of charge to normal users... could I license it for companies to use?

I am asking because I have been told that copyrights exist more-so to protect the "method" of arriving at a solution, as opposed to the solution itself, and - to me - this is exactly what I intend on doing?

**In summary, I want to develop a high-level programming language which produces code written in other pre-existing programming languages as output. Am I able to legally charge money under certain circumstances for this technology?**

<p>Alright, so your idea is a programming language which gets transcoded to another programming language -- kind of like CoffeScript to Javascript, Less to CSS, or Google Web Toolkit Java to Javascript.</p>

<p>As you can see by the prior work I mentioned, there is no copyright problem here. I would suggest you have a quick look at this <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/12/10/someone-stole-my-startup-idea-%E2%80%93-part-3-the-best-defense-is-a-good-strategy/">post about types of intellectual property</a> to get a clearer picture. Also have a <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/copyright">look at the Copyright tag</a>.</p>

<p>Where you might get into problems is with patents. Cross-compilers were a very busy commercial field some time ago, and it's entirely possible that some large companies hold patents on certain optimizations and general methods. Again, have a <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/patent">look at the Patent tag</a>.</p>

<p>Performing a global, comprehensive search for prior patents is nearly impossible for a resource-weak startup. Most web- &amp; software startups simply take a chance and launch a product without checking for prior patents.</p>
