I have a client that has a .NET saas. We're looking for a reliable Windows/.NET host with Sql Server 2008 host that has good support. The gotcha is it also needs to support php and mysql for a Wordpress install. Who do you have a good experience with?

<p>At my previous firm, we used <strong>MaximumASP</strong> - <a href="http://www.maximumasp.com/promo/ws2008.aspx" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on their site specifically refers to PHP on their servers.  I wouldn't say they were cheap, but their support was always excellent as was uptime.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them, but you obviously need to check out their take on MySQL.</p>
