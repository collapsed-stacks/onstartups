Initial filing fee: Minimum of $75. Fees are based on the value of total number of authorized shares - See http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=609
Annual list of officers: $125
Annual publication: $Varies based on newspaper publication prices. See: http://nvsos.gov/index.aspx?page=244#259

NRS 80.190: This requires each foreign corporation doing business in this state to publish a statement, not later than the
end of the third month following the close of each fiscal year, of its last calendar yearâ€™s business in two issues of a
newspaper published in this state that has a total weekly circulation of at least 1,000.  Refer to NRS 80.190 for the required
contents of this report

So you're looking at something above $200 per year. A $100 business license fee may be involved for those not doing business in Nevada itself (doesn't appear to apply in your case). You'll also need a registered agent so that probably brings it up to at least $280-$300 a year at minimum.
