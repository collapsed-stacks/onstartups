This will probably be a open-ended question, considering that it might be very opinionated... But I'm curious to hear from the community here-- why do some fail at getting past the conceptual phase of their venture and others seem to be quite good at it and enjoy it? I'm especially curious about the psychology and the traits you feel make an entrepreneur successful in at the very least getting off the ground.

I know first hand that experience is a big one. Tiny successes build confidence, which make more successes. I don't think that is all there is though.

<h2>Fear</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://the99percent.com/videos/5822/Seth-Godin-Quieting-the-Lizard-Brain" rel="nofollow">lizard brain</a> is talking.</p>

<p>That's why many entrepreneurs fail today. Not because they are not competent enough or because their idea is not good.</p>

<p>Because they face different fear behavior. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination" rel="nofollow">Procrastination</a> is one of the most common.</p>

<p>You mention psychology. Psychology is probably the most determining factor to success. Before competence &amp; idea.</p>

<p>That's why I suggest to every entrepreneur to read about it. There are many books that talk about psychology with even using the word. <strong>E-Myth</strong> is one of the most popular book on the subject, <strong>7 Habits</strong> is another (first chapter) and many others. </p>

<p>Ever heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Myth" rel="nofollow">E-Myth</a>? </p>

<p>From <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/29254/Commit-To-Your-Core-9-Reasons-Why-Every-Entrepreneur-Should-Outsource.aspx" rel="nofollow">Onstartups</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Years ago Michael Gerber coined the
  the term E-Myth, referring to the
  entrepreneurial myth of people going
  into business to do what they love,
  only to realize that 80% of the
  business has nothing to do with their
  passion--but instead with building and
  running a company.</p>
  
  <p>This often results in one of two
  outcomes: The founder hates his job or
  the business fails--usually the former
  follows the latter quite closely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many times the "block and tackle" type tasks that starting &amp; running a business requires overwhelms the startup.  Outsourcing this can help (as suggested in the above referenced onstartups post) but that only brings you so far - it's not all "build your super awesome idea and customers come rushing in" type of fantasy that gets promoted.  </p>

<p>But, if you approach startups with the right perspective, expect to do a lot more than you initially expected, and can read / correctly interpret eemingly conflicting inputs from multiple sources, you have a chance to gain some traction.  Whether that traction meets your definition of success is up to you.  </p>
