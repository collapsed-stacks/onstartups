This is a pretty trivial question but I'd be interested in your opinions.

Would you include post-nominal letters and/or other qualifications on your business cards?  Do you think it's overly formal/slightly pretentious, or do you think it conveys a degree of professionalism?

I suppose if you are a doctor or a lawyer, or in some similarly regulated profession, then it makes sense, but what about the rest of us?

I'm leaning towards just using my name as this seems to be common practise in the tech world, and the alternative strikes me as a bit immodest, but I'd be interested if anyone thinks that's a bad idea.

Depends on the industry.  For example, if you are a biotech firm doing research and you have a PhD then it could make sense to put that on your card.  For your usual tech startups, I wouldn't.  Do you want to be addressed as Dr.?  Heck, I don't even bother with a title on my card.

That does seem like "tooting your own horn" so to speak, like printing one's resume on their business card...In my opinion, I would just put your name, company, and contact info, along with your position...let your performance speak for itself, and if they request your resume, give it to them...

For a tech startup card, perhaps on the other side, list what your company does...

I agree with Oleg. You have to look at the particular industry you're in as to whether it makes sense or not. Look at others in that space too. Do they do it or not? In general in the tech world, I rarely see that. And when I do, I must admit I think it's a little pretentious if it's not really relevant to the company/industry.

It's annoying IMO. 

I always chuckle when I get a business card from a Realtor, MCSE or CISSP. (I actually have a card from a GRI (Graduate Realtor)/CNE (Novell)/CCNA) Passing some test about selling houses or twiddling Windows Server isn't really something I care about if I'm not looking at your resume.

On the other hand, if you're board-certified rocket surgeon, you've earned the alphabet soup on your card.
