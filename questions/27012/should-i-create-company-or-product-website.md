For a startup company with 1 product which website will be more beneficial? Should I create website that concentrates on a product or my company?

My software targets transportation/trucking industry and my potential clients will be small to medium fleet owners. Current product is standalone module used with mobile devices which can also integrate with bigger packages.

Next anticipated product is a TMS (transporation management software) which will be big.

"Nobody cares about your company or your products. They only care about how you can help them solve their problem." - David Meerman Scott

In that sense, you want to develop a product website but you cannot focus on benefits. You need to focus on problems that you can solve. Your question provided details about your target market and product architecture, but there was no mention of the problem you're solving. Start with that, then move to how your product solves those problems, and only then should you start talking about features and architecture. For example, instead of talking about "mobile devices," explain how your product allows drivers to spend more time on the road and less time in the office/depot/yard.

"Should I create website that concentrates on a product or my company?" - Unless somebody wants to buy you company you should concentrate entirely on you product site. 

- Present benefits for potential clients in clear and concise form. 
- Demonstrate how you product works.

It should contain enough information to understand everything for you product without asking additional questions. (But there will be questions perhaps).

Small and medium sized customers care about costs more than anything.

"Save $800 a year on fuel costs."

"Average clent saves $ 1200 per year on maintenance costs."

I agree with the answer above, concentrate on problem solving.  Put yourself in the shoes of your clients and tailor your website towards solutions.  Even tossing in a few testimonials reinforces a positive experience.

"I had my doubts at first but SuperTool has delivered a lot of bang for the buck - Joe B - Dime Box, TX"

Consider yourself lucky you only have 1 product at the moment.  Much easier to customize a website around a single product.  Keep the site simple and clean.
