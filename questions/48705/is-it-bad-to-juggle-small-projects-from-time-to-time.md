Coming up with ideas for entrepreneurs isn't really a problem. Execution on the other hand, as I have experienced, is by far the hardest thing to keep on top with, especially if you have to keep your day job.

Since I was able to read *Lean Startup* by [Eric Ries][1] and *Running Lean* by [Ash Maurya][2], executing startup projects don't have to be as explicit as it was before, but I'm struggling with the execution part since I wanted to do about 3-4 small projects. I don't just jump to execution, by following the risk management using Lean canvasses I make sure that I'll be building something that someone will want and has a business model.

In your perspective/experience, is it bad to juggle small projects from time to time? I've read a part on Lean Startup where Aadvark started by doing several projects to validate their idea(s). That said, I'm planning to do the same.

I believe that focus and perseverance is important in making ideas happen., but I still seek some advice on my plan.

If you have a full time job and are doing these projects in your spare time I would recommend focusing on one good idea / problem you are trying to solve.  Especially if execution has been a problem for you in the past. Some people may be able to juggle multiple projects across a team to validate solutions for a specific problem or industry. 

But, as an individual with many other things going on I would suggest taking your best idea and focusing on that and following the Lean principles with just that initially.
