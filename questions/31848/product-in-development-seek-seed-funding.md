I think this response gives me a good explanation for what to in regards to having an idea/prototype and seeking funding [Is having a working prototype required for getting seed funding(first round)?][1] My question then is since this was two years ago - with the advent of stuff like **gust** and **angel.co** - is this advice still solid? Especially from people who have used these services, is it a smart idea to go ahead and proceed with filling our my profiles on both and seek investment funding given we only have a prototype? We also have been emailing potential customers, so we have that going for us to. Any advice would be appreciated.

I see no harm in seeking funding, they can only say no.  Getting a basic working prototype isn't too hard though, is there a reason you can't?  I would say that it would definitely increase your chance of funding, and any time you can do that it's time well spent.
