I founded and was running a twitter tool all by myself. I was the sole Founder, CEO,CFO and whatnot.

But, now that I have sold the tool, what happens to my Founder status? Can I still brag the `Founder at @MyApp` title on my twitter and elsewhere? I know I'm still the "Founder" ie one who invented this tool, but still..?

Does this include asking the person about this whom I sold it to? He's another individual, just like me, and not a company.

Would this be deemed as a professional practice?

You're still founder of @MyApp, the guy you sold it to is owner of @MyApp.

See how "Creator" feels instead of "Founder". Either way there is no reason not to say you created/founded your previous venture on your resume/website/twitter etc

I don't think you should still claim the founder title. Others may interpret you still to be affiliated with the product, the purchaser may not want this.

Rather than our subjective opinions, ask the purchaser of it, ultimately if they don't mind, then you are not doing anything morally wrong.

I think the fact be told !! You are founder and will remain founder. Probably you want to mention it that you are no more with that company or product which is taken for granted by many !!
