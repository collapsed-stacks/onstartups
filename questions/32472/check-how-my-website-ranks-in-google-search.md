Is there an easy way to check where my website ranks in google search for certain keywords?

I try searching in google myself, but I am sure the results are altered based on my demographic and social graph.  Can I either turn that off, or is there a free tool that's reliable?

The only useful way to check you rank is to add you site to Google webmaster tools and to look at "Search queries". Then, look at "Average position" for each query and click on specific query to see distribution of positions. You can additionally apply filters by country and type of search at the top of "Search queries" page.

<p>Are you asking for which page your site appears on, or what your page rank is?  There are a lot of free tools to check both, though I'm not sure if they provide the demographic options that you're asking about.</p>

<ol>
<li>Page Number - Do a search for "what page of google am I on" to see a range of options.  <a href="http://whatpageofsearchamion.com/" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> an example that I've used.</li>
<li>Page Rank - Again, a search result will return a range of options (try "check google page rank").  Since no one knows the specifics of how Google ranks the pages these tools are approximations, and there are paid options which may provide better approximations.  I tend to select a couple of free tools and average their results.  <a href="http://www.prchecker.info/check_page_rank.php" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> an example.  </li>
</ol>

Also depends how you are getting your visibility. If you are using Google Adwords then do NOT search your own keywords in the normal way. Two reasons for this, first is that you won't get an accurate picture of your visibility for several reasons (budget, geo-targeting, etc). Secondly, you will damage your Quality Score and therefore damage your campaign.

If you need any help with Adwords, that's what we do, so please don't hesitate to contact me to discuss.
