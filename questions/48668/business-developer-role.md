I've got a fairly good business, producing a profit and revenues of half what I need to live.  I'm an idea man and nurture lots of great ideas over time.  I'm looking to have someone else run with one of my ideas.  Although I will retain ownership I will grant some royalties on the revenue.  

What's the role of business developer vs. CEO vs. business advisor?  Is a business developer kinda like a mini-CEO?  Are they usually responsible for P&L?  Would she have her own business bank account in her country?  

Thank you!

A CEO will run the company for you. A business developer uses certain processes in order to grow your company, but is not responsible for P&L. Usually, it is an independent consultant who works with your team, but at the end of the day, the company holds responsibility for P&L . A business adviser is someone who advises you on certain issues, based on their own expertise. You could consider them as a coach, mentor...

I think what you're looking for is a CEO, who will run your company, be held responsible for results, and earns bonuses when achieving certain milestones.
