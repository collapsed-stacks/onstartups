I am looking for a Customer Relationship Management program that also allows the customer to create or edit orders.  There are many different CRMs but info@hand is the only one I was able to find where the customer can view their information as well as create orders.

What are other CRMs that have a customer portal which allows the customer to create orders?

Not out yet, but soon to be (first quarter of 2010) is Client Data Tracker. If you want more information about this product, contact ekochman@optimalupgrades.com for more information. Yes, this is self-promotion, but I am in the middle of working on precisely such a product.
