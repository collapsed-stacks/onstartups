Anyone know of any software which I can input expenses, revenue, traffic, users and other things that are important to a SaaS start up and it will generate some graphs and basic overviews.

Right now I am using Excel and don't mind continuing to use it but maybe there is something out there already with some nice features.

<p>I don't know anything specific to SaaS but I imagine a decent accounting program would be a good fit for you.</p>

<p>See if <a href="http://waveaccounting.com/" rel="nofollow">Wave Accounting</a> can help you out. It's 100% free which is awesome. I moved over to it about a year ago, it's plenty good and can import data directly from your bank statements. So, you won't even have to key in your SaaS income. <strong>Just shows up!</strong></p>
