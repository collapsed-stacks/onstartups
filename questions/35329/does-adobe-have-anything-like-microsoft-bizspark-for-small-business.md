Seems Creative studio is around $2500 to get it legitimately, unless I can finish everything in 30days :). I need illustrator,ps,flash and fireworks.

The closets thing I've seen is for students only. Instead of paying $2500 you'd pay something like $600, but like I said, you need to be a student to get the discount.

If you are interested, there are some open source (aka "free") alternatives to some Adobe products. Some have a learning curve and less features but can get the job done. Check them out here:
