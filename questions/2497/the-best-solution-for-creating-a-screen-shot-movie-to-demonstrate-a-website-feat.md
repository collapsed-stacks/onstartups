We recently just launched a new space planner/floor plan tool on our site and would like to create a screen-shot movie (with a voiceover commentary) to visually demonstrates its ease of use. Can anyone recommend the most effective/affordable/easy solution for this?

<p>There are a number of screencasting utilities out there. Some are free, but for these I'd say there are better options to be had for ~$20 and the added features and quality are worth the minimal cost.</p>

<p>A few options:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.polarian.com/products/ScreenMimic.php" rel="nofollow">Screen Mimic</a> (Mac OS X)</li>
<li><a href="http://shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html" rel="nofollow">iShowU</a> (Mac OS X)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.easyscreencapturevideo.com/" rel="nofollow">EasyScreenCapture</a> (Win)</li>
<li><a href="http://camstudio.org/" rel="nofollow">CamStudio</a> (Win)</li>
</ul>

<p>More expensive ("Professional") but very powerful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp" rel="nofollow">Camtasia</a> (Win/Mac)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate/" rel="nofollow">Adobe Captivate</a> (Win/Mac)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Camtasia Studio (for years for PCs, now also for the Mac) is the leader for depth and sophistication. There's a sizable community built up around Camtasia. But having the right tool doesn't mean you'll get the results you want. Screencasting is a learned skill. </p>

<p>One new resource you should check out is Ian Ozsvald - Ian's "day job" is creating screencasts for companies. That may be out of your budget. But his Screencasting Handbook at <a href="http://TheScreencastingHandbook.com" rel="nofollow">http://TheScreencastingHandbook.com</a> is currently free. Grab it.</p>

I am a big fan of the free screen capture site http://www.screentoaster.com/  

I first read about them on techcrunch which gave them a great review and I've been using it ever since to make presentations of my screen.

[CamStudio](http://camstudio.org/) if you need something free.

<p>I made <a href="http://vimeo.com/6672923" rel="nofollow">this video</a> using iShowU and iMovie on a Mac.  I was very impressed with how easy iShowU was and would recommend it to anyone.</p>

<p>Another tip: Use a decent microphone, like one on a headset.</p>

<p>Finally, set aside a looong block of time.  Ours was a ten minute video and it took me about 6 hours to get everything right.  It will be faster next time, but there's a lot of stumbling in the beginning.</p>

We use Camtasia Studio but if you use gotomeeting while giving a demo you can record the session and use it.  Kind of doing two things at once.

<p><a href="http://www.jingproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Jing</a> is quite good as well. What I love about it that it's dead easy with integrated free online screencast / HD support </p>

On top of those great software suggestion, I would like to add that getting the narration done by a professional could be a really good investment.

If you're on Snow Leopard, the QuickTime Player application (included in the system) can record the screen. iMovie lets you assemble different recordings with transitions and voiceover.

I have to second Abhi's recommendation: Wink is the way to go.
