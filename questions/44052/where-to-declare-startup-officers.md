I co-founded a company recently, and we incorporated as a Delaware C-Corp.

We listed President/Secretary/etc when filing, but we simply _decided_ CTO, CEO, and CFO. I've heard from others that what is listed initially when filing (CTO, CFO, COO, etc.) is not quite official.

When signing the vesting agreements, the corresponding officers did list their positions as such. This is also in the minutes for our board meetings.

Where is the correct place (if any) to legally place this in documents?

Typically, the correct place is in the minutes. The bylaws of the corporation will usually describe the various officer positions, their responsibilities, and well as how officers and directors are appointed. Once the bylaws are established, the method to appointment is usually just a resolution of the board in keeping with any requirements in the bylaws. There is no need to have the names of officers or board members in the filed certificate of incorporation. 

(The above is not legal advice and does not create an attorney/client relationship between us)

As much as I know from my experience, the only people to be listed are CEO, President, and directors on the board. There is no need to list others. If there are any employment law violations (once you go above the threshold of your state), lawyers will go after CEO and President. Others aren't really considered "officers" until company is public.
Also, I would highly encourage you all to stick with "co-founder" titles. Without employees, having all those titles is, well... just an indication of lack of humility (turn-off for early investors, or at least the ones I have worked with).
Co-founder is a lot more noble and credible title anyway.
