I recently created 2 websites about missed opportunities to build some buzz about a book that is currently being published. 

I would appreciate any advice, comments or suggestions about the 2 sites and the "brand" I created. 

Thank You for any help.

Trying to build a brand around something perceived as negative - "missed opportunities" - is like trying to push a barrow up a mountain. It isn't clear who your target market is but whoever they are, they won't be attracted to something negative.

As an entrepreneur, I don't want to know about missed opportunities, I don't want to learn from a bunch of people who missed it. That doesn't excite me.

Could I learn something useful? Probably. But the branding is not pushing me to want to know more.

If I were you, I would reframe the concept entirely.

Opportunities such as what? I think that your website (OpportunityWillKnock.com) needs to make that a little more clear. 

As far as Missed-Ops.com goes, it took too long to load and I was immediately turned off. As a consumer/customer/client, I think that would impact my decision to use it. In fact, it impacted my decision to even wait for it to load completely. 

Who is your target market? What type of people are you looking to get to view your website on a regular basis?
