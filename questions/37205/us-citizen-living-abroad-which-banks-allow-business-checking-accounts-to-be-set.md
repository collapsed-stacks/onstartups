I'm a US citizen living abroad.  I already have a C corporation (Delaware) for which the initial paperwork (Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, etc.) have been done.  I also have an EIN for the corporation from the IRS.

Because of the nature of my business (selling memberships to an Internet site), my banking needs are quite simple: I need a checking account from which I can pay for web hosting, and hopefully sometime this year I'll need a place to deposit my earnings that have been collected via PayPal.  That's it.

I am now looking to set up a business checking account in the US.  Which banks allow me to do so easily (no notarized forms, all application documents can be e-mailed or faxed)?

EDIT (additional info): I have valid forms of personal ID (Passport, Drivers License) and 3 US bank accounts (my personal accounts) already.  My business also has a U.S. mailing address.  I plan to keep my US citizenship; I will not be living abroad forever.  I just want to set up an account, if possible, without going home (flights from Asia are expensive).

I don't know if the banks will let you open business accounts if your address is outside the US but you can certainly try opening one at:

* [BofA](https://www5.bankofamerica.com/small_business/olbextended/index.cfm?template=interstitial&app=business_economy_checking&state=PA&offer_code=&source_id=&RequestTimeOut=300)
* [Chase](https://chaseonline.chase.com/Public/OAO/GettingStarted.aspx?PROD_CODE=010&SUB_PROD_CODE=397&PROD_SEG=SMALLBUSINESS)

The problem is that Banks may require that you prove who it is that you are so your face to your ID may be a must, but you can try to get these links filled out to see if they will forgo this requirement.
