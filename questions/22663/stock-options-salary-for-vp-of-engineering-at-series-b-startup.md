I am trying to understand the right compensation for VP of engineering at a series B company with $10+M revenue in 2010 with plans to double it in 2011. The company is 5+ years old and has gone through weird financial structures in the early days to stay afloat.. It's currently raising series C. 

Any suggestions are much appreciated.

<p>Fred Wilson has a great system for making a quick determination on equity (obviously the rule isn't hard and fast, but it's a great place to start).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/11/employee-equity-how-much.html" rel="nofollow">From his blog:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you have the brackets set up, you put a multiplier next to them. There are no hard and fast rules on multipliers. You can also have many more brackets than four. I am sticking with four brackets to make this post simple. Here are our default brackets:</p>
  
  <p>Senior Team: 0.5x</p>
  
  <p>Director Level: 0.25x</p>
  
  <p>Key Functions: 0.1x</p>
  
  <p>All Others: 0.05x</p>
  
  <p>Then you multiply the employee's base
  salary by the multiplier to get to a
  dollar value of equity. Let's say your
  VP Product is making $175k per year.
  Then the dollar value of equity you
  offer them is 0.5 x $175k, which is
  equal to $87.5k. Let's say a director
  level product person is making $125k.
  Then the dollar value of equity you
  offer them is 0.25 x $125k which is
  equal to $31.25k.</p>

I haven't done this myself but have heard and quite liked the the following:

Given the goal of the comapny (buyout or public list) what is this likely to be $100M? or more? pick a nice figure for them to get at this point ... say $1M for arguments sake. Then scale this backwards to where you are today. 

In my example it is 1% of the company because the math is easy.

The incentive being "This is what you are driving towards", we go well hit our targets, your a millionaire (or you can buy a house ... etc).

Probably at this point after 5 years, there are many "hands in the pot" so the equity wouldn't be as good.  Plus after 10 million dollars investment there was likely some dilution.

I can't say exactly, but definitely under 5% equity.  Probably much less.
