Is there a website that lists all the upcoming tech meet-ups in each city?  I'm new the tech world and cant seem to hear of any events in Los Angeles.

<p><a href="http://meetup.com" rel="nofollow">Meetup</a> should have some (informal) tech meetups. It does in my city at least. Looking at the search results, there's plenty of groups in LA too.</p>
