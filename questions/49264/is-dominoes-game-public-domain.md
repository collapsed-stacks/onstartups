I'm contemplating writing an Android version of the dominoes game which I'll release in Google Play and I wondered if there's a chance of committing a copyright infringement by doing so.

I did a small research and it seems that no one owns the rights for the game since it has been around for centuries, but I still didn't manage to get information on its licence.

Can anyone, more knowledgeable on the topic, confirm that dominoes is indeed public domain?

Thanks,
Martin

<p>You are in Bulgaria? So in your country, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_lengths" rel="nofollow">copyright expires after authors life + 70 years. And other countries have similar rules.</a> </p>

<p>Since there is no copyright on the game any longer, there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License" rel="nofollow">no license</a>. And dominos is an old game, it predates modern Intellectual Property constructs like (software-) patents and trademarks.</p>

<p><strong>So yes, the game of dominoes is in the public domain.</strong></p>

<p>That doesn't mean that <em>everything <strong>related</strong> to</em> dominos necessarily is in the public domain .. for example, if an artist has recently made an artistic design for dominos chips, then that particular artwork is his.</p>
