I'd like to start a thread discussing the type of funding different startups are using and why.  I think that there are a lot of people here who would like to hear the general experiences, advantages, and pitfalls relating to each.  Are you:

* Bootstrapping, either from cash you have, credit cards, bank / SBA-backed loans, etc?
* Funding from friends / family - also - are you financing with debt (convertible or not) or equity?
* Angel funding (seed, initial rounds).
* VC funding (Series A, B, etc).

Also - discuss why you went the route you did.

We are bootstrapping, sort of. We opted for a service + product model. We offer development services that generate immediate income, then pump that money back into building products.

This is not an easy model to follow, however. I know of a few famous successful examples (37signals being the main one), but the difficulties are numerous. So I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others, unless you have a very disciplined team & clear vision.

We went this route because 37signals was one of our role models. Also, realistically, we didn't have a lot of personal capital from which to start. We also shied away from outside capital because we wanted to retain control over our products - at least in the early stages. Outside funding may be considered later, once we've released a product and seen how well the market reacted to it.

I'm bootstrapping, fully self funded.  I fear screwing someone elseâ€™s money up but ok with losing my own.  I'm still early and when the business proves itself out then I'll reassess but without having real metrics I just don't feel comfortable putting real money on it.

Also being very incremental in spending and methodical with most of my equity from sweat.
