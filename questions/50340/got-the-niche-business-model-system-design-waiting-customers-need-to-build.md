**Classic Chicken or Egg Dilemma:**

1. I need to raise funds to build the system I have designed.
2. I need the system built to generate revenue from my customer.
3. I need to be generating revenue to raise funds for the build out.

**Details:**

I'm an independent small business IT consultant that used to work on enterprise development for Fortune 500 clients.  I had drinks with a former client and discussed a problem they need solved, for which I proposed a relatively simple cloud based web application.  A week later client calls to tell me they'd pay to use it if I had it built, when can I have a demo ready?  

The actual development is beyond my capacity, though it would be easy for a good developer.  Also, now that I've formally documented the system design, I see that a significant business model could be built around it.  Minor tweaks to my initial design make this marketable to a whole industry, one which is completely under served.  My system could solve real problems there and I have connections to start the sales channel, assuming I have a working system.  New functionality can be added to the initial system later that would be easy to implement and create new revenue streams.  

**Back to the questions and my dilemma.**  

1. I need to find a good developer I can trust to build out the initial prototype.
2. I need to get funding together for the initial build.

The system isn't complex, but will probably take a good two months for a good full time developer to build.  I don't work for free and don't expect anyone else to, but I also don't have the cash on hand to pay a full-time employee (particularly someone with the necessary skills) for two months without this system generating revenue.  My original plan was to go to local VC/incubators I have contacts at, but I'd rather approach them after the initial system is built and generating revenue.  Those guys tend to value an operating revenue generating business model much more than a great idea for one.

**Questions:**

How do I find a good developer I can trust to build this out?

My next step is: build it or get funding?  How do I do one without the other?

This is why rich people get richer.  Because they have money to put behind good ideas, deals and opportunities.  With that said, your problem is not that complicated. 

I would recommend one of two options. 

 1. If you have a good relationship with the company which wants the software get them to put their intentions to buy your software on paper.  This is called a Letter of Intent, and basically breaks down that they will pay you X dollars a month for X months if you can deliver X service by X date.   Its not easy to get, and most companies dont go signing off these letters willy nilly.  But you can explain to them that with the letter you can break ground on the project and deliver it to them.  The alternative is that they spend their own time and resources on the project which sometimes just doesnt make sense. If you get your LOI then you can raise money from investors, friends, and use those funds to hire a developer. 
 2. Option two, is to build it yourself.  You can raise capital by tapping your own resources.  This can be as simple as using your own money, changing your personal budget, getting extra cash by getting a room-mate, selling something you own.  It all depends on how much it costs a developer to build your "simple" project.  Use those funds to build your software and then use any profit you make to grow it, refine it, and market it. 
 3. Option 3 is to bring on a partner who can handle the development for equity.  This is harder in practice than theory.  The reason is that good developers are usually not waiting around to waste their time on money they could be making versus collecting $50 - $250 hour getting paid to work on projects.   It all depends on who you can find.  If you find someone who is passionate and sees the potential then they might be willing to invsest their time to get it off the ground.  Talk to your local college to see if any Software Development students would take the job as experience or resume building project with possible equity, or bonus based on performance. 


Last note, You really dont want to be raising funding unless you really have to.  Use your own money first, dont give up equity so quicky if its a good idea.

You have a single interested client - **that alone does not make a business.**

> I have connections to start the sales channel
 
Then start now. Find other companies in the same space and figure out if they have the same needs and demands.

Once you've validated that your offering is something that is truly wanted, then determine whether the demand is strong enough to support a business. In addition to Franks suggestions, consider doing a paid beta with multiple interested parties (shows commitment and generates cash) or offer a discounted license to generate enough cash to fund development.

If you really can recoup the dev costs in 4-6 months, go get a loan!  Even if you close after 12 months you have 6 months of profit.

Hire the developer offering to pay the first 6 months worth of sales directly to them.  If it never goes live, they don't get paid.

If you want a developer, I'm willing to listen.  My username is my gmail address.
