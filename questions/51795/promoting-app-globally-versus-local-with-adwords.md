<p>I signed up for google adwords to advertise but I kinda feel it is useless service as my app is a desktop app (shareware type download) and shouldnt be tied to a local region. In my scenario, it is targeted for NJ within 40 miles. I dont sell my service, just the software so its kinda silly. Am I supposed to create a campaign for every state in the US and the world? someone enlighten me how this works pls? :)
How is everyone advertising their application globally? I already had few buyers form australia, europe and asia and I dont know exactly how they found it as I have never tried advertising it before until now. Any tips?</p>

<p>Use Google Analytics for the first days to see from where you traffic comes from, organically.</p>

<p>Then use that data and create an AdWords campaign for the countries you're getting the most sales (e.g. AU, UK, US).</p>

<p>You don't need to create a campaign for each state. It might help to create one for each country if it makes sense for you to advertise individually to each market.</p>
