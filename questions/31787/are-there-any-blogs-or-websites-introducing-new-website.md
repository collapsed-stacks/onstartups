I want to know is there any blogs or websites introducing some of new websites?

New start-up websites are always looking for report and introduction by other famous websites.

As we know, TechCrunch.com is one of them.

And any more?

Just list it out.

http://www.killerStartups.com is a good website but let me share some other good sites that can review your website/business for FREE and have a great number of readership as well that you might need to promote your services.

Also create company profiles at Crunchbase and Startuply. Both these sites will generate lots of good traffic for you in quick succession.

And donâ€™t forget to create your website profile at Squidoo and HubPages.

I hope you will find these resource websites very useful to market your startup.

I like Betalist (http://betali.st/). They feature around a website **in private beta** per day. Not long ago they had a contest: the most tweeted website would get the chance to give a pitch to a VC fund.

<p>I heartily recommend <a href="http://www.killerstartups.com">KillerStartups</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Our submission was reviewed within 24 hours (for free).</li>
<li>The review for our application was actually better than the promotional text we provided.</li>
<li>Most importantly: once the review was out, a lot of other similar startup review sites that were "listening" on KillerStartups' RSS feed, were quick to review the app as well.</li>
<li>Consequently, the number of new users and number of page views had jumped significantly.</li>
</ol>
