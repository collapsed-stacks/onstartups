I am the owner of a C Corp in DE. Developers are working remotely across the country.
I live in PA.

am I required to register a foreign entity in PA and other states that the developers are working from?

Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: depends on whether they're your employees, or contractors. The fact that you pay with 1099-MISC is not enough for them to be contractors, so even if you "consider" them contractors, they might not be per the Federal or the State law in the respective states. For PA - you're an officer of the corporation, and as such - employee (unless you're not actively participating in the business, that is).
