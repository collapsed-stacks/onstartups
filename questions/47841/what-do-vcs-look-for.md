I'm writing an article on a San Francisco startup competition featuring the young Japanese entrepreneur finalists (eventbrite info [here][1]) and was wondering what investors and judges are looking for when it comes to presenting their ideas. What's the best angle to take? Is a thorough intro and summary necessary, or should they use the precious time to do something uniquely memorable?

<p>In addition to ron's answer, I would add:</p>

<ul>
<li>understanding of the customer market</li>
<li>customer adoption (aka traction)</li>
<li>cost of customer acquisition</li>
<li>lifetime value of customer</li>
</ul>

<p>And (if SaaS) where on the ramp are they? (as in, the long <a href="http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/gail-goodman-constant-contact-how-to-negotiate-the-long-slow-saas-ramp-of-death/" rel="nofollow">slow SaaS ramp of death</a>)</p>
