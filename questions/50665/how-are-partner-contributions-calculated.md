I am just curious on this one. I understand that partners usually have to contribute capital. What is the very general calculation used to work out how much would be required to contribute for x share in profits?

Assuming your ownership structure is straightforward--each owner's % ownership correlates directly to their share of profits--the general formula is (Individual Contribution) = (Total Partner Funds) * (% Ownership in company). Here's a basic example, you can plug in your own numbers: 

Company XYZ

Owners:

- Fred    30%

- Jane    30%

- Angel   40%

Total Capital Contribution Required Currently:  $50,000

- Fred == $50,000 * 30% == $15,000

- Jane == $50,000 * 30% == $15,000

- Angel == $50,000 * 40% == $20,000

Total contributed == 15,000 + 15,000 + 20,000 = $50,000.

There is plenty of room to complicate this simple breakdown, but that's the general one that I would start from.
