The older I get and the more I get into entrepreneurship, I find myself having to talk more and more with different type of lawyers and accountants. 

Does it make sense to establish a relationship with such professionals from the beginning? and if so, what are the best ways to get to talk to them and establish a relationship when all you have is a new startup and not money?

No, it is totally preferably to learn about keeping proper accounting the moment you get sued your ass off from the government and that you totally ddestroyed your compayn from makint mistakes in your contracts because you are  a legal ignorant.

Nothing.

See, without monry for basic setup procesdures you do NOT have a startup, you have a funny idea. I dont say you need tons of money, but I always got basic advice for 2-3 days worth of my income (when I was earning lower). If you have not enough money to pay for the ticket to register your business, dont run around telling people you have a startup. Get a job at McDonalds and save enough to pay for the setup of your operations.

Yes.  I'm a lawyer.  I handle start-ups, from incorporation to initial financing rounds to going public.

If you don't have a lawyer from day 1, you will do things that may seem insignificant but can have severe consequences on your business down the road (financial or otherwise), and when it comes time to doing a financing, cleaning up the mess will delay your financing and be much more expensive (for legal fees) than if you had just contacted a lawyer in the first place.  Even if you can't/don't pay, just bounce things off the lawyer- they will gladly answer quick questions.

Yes, you should get to know such professionals up-front. 

State that you don't have the money to retain anyone right now, but you would like to establish a relationship so you know whom to retain when the right time arrives. Then ask  for a brief chat by telephone or over coffee with the objective that you'll learn which start-up blunders to avoid (i.e., when you need to seek professional expertise).
