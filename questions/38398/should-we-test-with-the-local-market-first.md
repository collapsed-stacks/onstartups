Let's say I have a start up whose product is finished (high quality product).

What do you think about first beta testing the product on the local market  or going international right away?

I have an idea about gathering our local fans to get them really excited about the product, and then spread out the news. Basically testing ourselves on a local scale.

The sector is telecommunication, we're in the cloud, and it's B2C aspiring to get to B2B

I am seeking beta testers locally (and only locally). The ability to visit testers in person without buying a plane ticket or renting a hotel room is very valuable. My app is an "Enterprise" application. The feature list is long and quality time with my testers  has been very valuable. 

For a simpler application it might be more practical, but I think the more complex the application is the more value local testers offer.
