This may seem a little off topic and I apologize, but this is the closest SE site I can think to post on regarding my issue.

I live in the state of Illinois. I have an app in the Apple iPhone AppStore called "The Dirty Mind Test". The other day, I got a letter from the lawyers of a company called TDC Games. They claimed they own the right to the trademark "Dirty Minds", and that my app is clearly infringing on their copyright. They said we must take our app down by the 1st of February to avoid legal action. 

I dont see how they can own a trademark or copyright on a totally generic term. They claim they own "Dirty Minds", but my app is called "The Dirty Mind Test". Do they have a case? What should I do?

 1. Do **not** reply to them. 

 2. Contact a trademark attorney right away.

TDC Games has a pretty good case.

* They makes a (board) game called *Dirty Minds*.
* You make a (phone) game called *The Dirty Mind Test*.

Since they're both games, it creates confusion in the marketplace. Especially if someone's browsing the app store and thinks "oh, I love *Dirty Minds*, I'll totally download their app". At least, that's what they're thinking. I'm not that convinced that this is true, but it's their opinion that matters.

Your best bet is to bend over and rename your app ("The Filthy Mind Test" or whatever). You could try to be nice ([Tim's](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/19417/trademark-infringement-on-product-name/19420#19420) suggestion is good), but remember that lawyers can be complete assholes, and you will have to defend a federal lawsuit (likely, in their jurisdiction) if they decide to sue you. That won't be fun, and it certainly won't be worth the hassle... especially for you, since you clearly don't have a lawyer you've asked about this already.

Remember, Hasbro felt pretty serious about this with [Scrabulous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabulous#Legal_and_copyright_issues), and put a whole bunch of effort into shutting it down. They eventually won their case in India (well, partially won), and Scrabulous is now called Lexulous.

<p>If it were me I'd respond and ask them how they can claim that when it should be pretty clear that you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Did not take any copyrighted material</li>
<li>Are not using their trademarks - just the "dirty mind" is common but since yours is not a board game I see no issue.  (I'm not a lawyer, but this seems like them just searching for "dirty minds" and sending letters to everyone.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd politely assert that you are not trying to confuse the public and that if they can show proof that you are or are hurting their company then offer to stop, but I see no reason for it.  </p>

<p><a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4009%3agcaecs.2.5" rel="nofollow">Here is their trademark</a></p>

<p>Note that the trademark is for "DIRTY MINDS THE GAME OF NAUGHTY CLUES" not "DIRTY MINDS".  (as well as other things) </p>

<p>Go see for yourself and then make a decision.  maybe you do want to avoid it - but I'd talk to them - no need right now to get a lawyer involved.  </p>
