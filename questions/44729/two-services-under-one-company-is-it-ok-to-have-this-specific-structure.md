In my mind i have two companies. A in the A industry and B in the B industry. Even though in some cases those two industries may have things in common, they are different.

Of course, name branding, market segmentation are different too.

My aim is to avoid as possible the fees and legal procedures on registering two companies. So, I hopefully suppose that A and B companies can be called services under one company.

If I do so, is it legal to have these? : 

- one registered company + trademarks + domain under the name "XXX Group" or in less preferable "XXX".
- a plethora of services under this company.
- contact the clients with "Hello we are A from XXX group.
- different trademarks + logos + domains for the services.
- invoices, agreements under the "XXX Group".
- one accounting for the "XXX group".

Thank you for your time and your valuable knowledge

You can certainly manage more than one revenue stream under one company this, but make sure you have a way (such as using the classes feature in Quickbooks) to keep the relevant products' revenues and expenses separate, so you can determine relative profitability, etc.

Of course, it is fine to offer numerous services as one company. If you need to, maybe register DBA's, so for example "A & B Inc" then DBA "A" and DBA "B".

It depends upon your jurisdiction, but I can't see any reason why you can't do this.

*NB: DBA means "Doing Business As" and I understand that these need to be registered in some jurisdictions.*

Could you not simply set up departments? 

So, for example, you would have acme .inc, which is the tax liable company, and then acme healthcare and acme iron girders departments.

Similar to the way Microsoft has Xbox, Windows, MSDN, Zune and Bing all under one company.
