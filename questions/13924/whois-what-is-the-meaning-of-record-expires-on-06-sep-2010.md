I'm looking to buy a domain name that is currently held by someone.  The record info (WhoIs) on GoDaddy says:

> Record expires on 06-Sep-2010.  
Record created on 06-Sep-2006.  
Database last updated on 6-Sep-2010 23:12:47 EDT.

I thought that meant the name would be available for purchase, but it doesn't seem to be.  What I am missing?

There's a grace period after the domain expires when the original owner can still renew it. 
http://www.wikihow.com/Acquire-an-Expired-Domain has some details about this, but I would google around for a more definitive resource.
