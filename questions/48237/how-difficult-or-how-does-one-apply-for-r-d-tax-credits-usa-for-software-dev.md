We are developing a new web-based product.

Looking for feedback from people who have applied for such tax credits.

 - What are the steps to applying for an R&D Tax Credit? 
 - How difficult was it is (rough estimate of your time and your CPA time)? 


Here's  a little  [information that suggests our software would qualify.][1]
