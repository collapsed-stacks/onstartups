My business is a New Zealand based IT hardware and support business focusing solely on small to medium businesses in my local region - Wellington.

- I have built the website. 
- I have registered the company and for tax.
- I have printed business cards.
- Also acquired remote support software, invoicing software and written up a support contract.

Is there anything I am missing? Or am I ready to begin going out and offering my services and products?

I know this may sound a bit harsh, but since you've obviously spent quite a bit of time/money on this project, do you have any existing customers, or at least any lined up to start with immediately. 

From my understanding of your sort of business, it generally starts with an existing customer (or business contacts) and then gets all of the other things set up over time. 

So to answer your question, as long as you have covered the essential legal areas - registering a company, getting a bank account (I'm not sure that's everything that you need in NZ, but from memory it sounds like the minimum set required for Australia) - then you're ready to rock. Get customers now and kick ass!
