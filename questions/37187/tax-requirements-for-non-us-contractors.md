I work with contractors often, and of course go the W-9 + 1099 route with US-based folks. I'll be hiring a handful of part-time non-US contract developers soon (one in Brazil, one in Switzerland). Just curious what, if any, tax filing requirements I need to look into that would correspond to W-9 and 1099?

<p>Can't find the same info for Brazil, but here is the exact same question asked by a <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060728020134AApObxa" rel="nofollow">contractor in Switzherland</a>, and <a href="http://www.englishforum.ch/finance-banking-taxation/77246-living-switzerland-working-company-us.html" rel="nofollow">here is another one</a>.</p>

<p>Based on the best I can figure you issue a 1099 to both and they file with <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1042.pdf" rel="nofollow">IRS form 1042</a> and based on the Double Taxation treaties existing between US and Brazil and US and Switzerland they will get credit for any taxes paid in the US.</p>
