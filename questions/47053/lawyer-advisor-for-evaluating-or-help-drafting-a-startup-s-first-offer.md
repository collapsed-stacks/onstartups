A profitable, single-founder web startup is making me an offer as the first employee (for CTO position).

It's particularly hard to evaluate the offer because:

* This company has never received any capital and doesn't have any recent VC valuations.
* Compensation offered has a somewhat unusual structure: a portion of monthly revenue with lower and upper bounds, plus equity.

What type of lawyer or advisor would best be able to help me evaluate the offer both in terms of value, and ensuring that it covers all the usual situations/topics?

I've found two pages that list some startup lawyers, but they are both from 2010, and they are mainly targeted at startup founders looking for lawyers which is not quite what I need here:

* [A list of social startup lawyers (venturehacks.com)][1]
* [Great Web Startup Lawyers (giffconstable.com)][2]

PS. I'm located in Silicon Valley

How to find an attorney?

There is no substitute for doing your homework.  Ask your colleagues who they use.  Get a list and start narrowing it down.  Check the state bar website to verify they are admitted.  See what Google turns up.  Contact the ones you like and ask enough questions to find out what they do and how they will bill you.  If you call their office and speak with their assistant, ask what they think of him/her.

Do not ask questions about specific legal advice unless you are willing to pay for it.  If the attorney agrees to a consultation, ask if you will be billed and how much.

If you wish to proceed, the attorney should perform a conflicts check, asking you a little bit about your matter and any possible competitors/adverse parties.

If everything looks good, then you should receive a written representation agreement that specifically explains what the attorney will do for you and how you will be charged.  The representation agreement is negotiable, so ask questions.
