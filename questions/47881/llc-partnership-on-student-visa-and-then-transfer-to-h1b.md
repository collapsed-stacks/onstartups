I am on F1 visa. I'm done with my masters and am on my OPT. Can I be a partner in an LLC? 
What about when I go on H1B.
I'm looking to startup in Texas & California both.

I tried to look for some documentation with regards to my particular visa situation but could not find anything substantial. Any help is appreciated.

<p>When on H1B - you can be limited partner. I.e.: not an active participant, but just an investor. Notice, that in order to be a limited partner, it has to be a <em>limited</em> <strong>partnership</strong> (<strong>not</strong> LLC or "regular" General Partnership). Unless, that is, the partnership/LLC is the one getting you the H1B.</p>

<p>On OPT you can be employed based on your EAD eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>This is not a legal advice, and I'm not an attorney. For a definitive answer talk to an immigration attorney.</p>
