I am a software engineer with two years of experience and I am planning to get into internet advertising. I can put in hard work. I have experience running a non-technical business. My problem is that I don't know where to start. How would I build a technical team and how would I pitch for customers?

Being in a really really competitive market, where giants like google have a big market share, its tough to take over some percentage of this market. In my point of view, you can try assisting people to use google ad-wards and ad-sense, or about marketing on social media or email. Creating effective ad-campaigns and doing effective email marketing for people can help you bootstrap your business and get some real world internet advertizing experience without risking much. A great market is out there of SEO (Search engine optimization) whether free or paid. When you have a reasonable number of customers, you can start taking advertizements directly and work on an advertiser publisher model like adbrite. 

To get a technical team, I would suggest posting job opening on various job sites and remember to specify your requirements completely. Another way is to attend hackthons to get in touch with technical people and then offer them the work.
