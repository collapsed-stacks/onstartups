I wrote [an app][1] that works [on an auction site][2] by doing dynamic bidding on the user's behalf given his login details, i.e. manages his auctions for him automatically. The user not only gets better deals this way, but the app also saves them a lot of time.

The problem is that given the sensitive nature of personal finance, [they think that my app is a scam][3]. In the end, the admin even removed my links based on mass hysteria alone. How can I convince these people to change their mind?

Here are some tips:

 - Have contact information on your website.  Without them knowing who you are or how to contact you, they are going to be doubtful.  A contact link to an email address is not enough.

 - Get a real domain name.  Your website address is not confidence inspiring.
 
 - Get https running on your site.  You're asking for sensitive information but not protecting it.

 - Have them sign up for your service with a username/password for your service before asking them for their funding circle credentials.  You can ask them for their funding circle details once in.  This will help get you some signups before asking for so much from them.

 - Explain clearly on your website how it works.

 - In fact... to be honest, your website is terrible. It looks like someone built it in just a few minutes.  You need to show you are serious about this.  Make a proper full website explaining your service.

Really, you have made no effort to look professional, so you shouldn't be surprised that people don't trust your service.  You can't just put a form up that asks people for the log in details to another service and expect them to do so.

I have tried to give some constructive points, but really you are so far away from where you need to be.  If you can't see that, I'd look for a co-founder that can help on the business side.

Lastly, I am guessing your service goes against Funding Circle's Terms of Service, so I wouldn't be expecting this to be a big success for you.

**Too late.**

Polling the community about what they disliked about the FC's proxy bidding and then working with interested parties towards a mutually accepted solution would have stood a better chance. 

Developing a positive reputation / with community approval (or at least acceptance) is critical for adoption. Even with credibility such a solution isn't a 100% guarenteed win, esp. when many consider **sniping** unethical / non-fair play. 

But posting announcements with exclamation points or responding with sarcasm isn't going to gain any positive reputation either.

I would suggest also getting a hard look on your actual graphic design. Using **Twitter Bootstrap** is very useful at times, but when abused makes anything look like something developed in just a few hours, and thus causes users not to trust your platform.

You should try to get someone do a little graphic work for you, and before doing any further investment in SSL certificates, domain, hosting or even time in the software itself, make sure people feel comfortable with your product. Otherwise, it is unlikely to grow and tend to "feel" like a scam.
