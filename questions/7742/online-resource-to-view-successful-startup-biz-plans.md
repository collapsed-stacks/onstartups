Is there an online resource where first time entrepreneurs can go to peruse startup biz plans that went on to become successful companies? If it does not exist, do you think it is a viable possibility in the future?

I understand certain businesses may be hesitant to share certain aspects of their business, but an early startup stage business plan should not have too much confidential information in it, and if the business went on to become successful, it is likely that that first business plan is no longer relevant the business model any longer...

Thoughts?

<p>Question: doesn't <a href="http://bplan.com" rel="nofollow">bplan.com</a> work for you?</p>

<p>The resources are good, they have an annual competition that's fun to participate in (disclaimer: <a href="http://www.bplans.com/n/index.cfm?a=v&amp;n=82#fp" rel="nofollow">I won first place one year</a>, so I'm biased) and <a href="http://timberry.bplans.com/" rel="nofollow">tim berry's blog</a> has good advice.</p>

<p>I'm not so certain companies are going to release their "winning" plans to the public (at the time, we were looking for funding and having a plan in public distribution didn't sit too well with some VC's - even though critical information was omitted.) </p>

Regardless of whether or not a business plan equates to success (there's a lot of debate on this topic), I think this could be an interesting idea.

If you can't find a resource like this 
(I don't know of any), perhaps you could start one. I imagine you could get a fair amount of readers, maybe even some that will pay to view business plans ;-)

Just like what you said, "if the business went on to become successful, it is likely that that first business plan is no longer relevant the business model any longer..." so, these biz plan isn't the successful one. 

I think these platform like http://www.kickstarter.com/ is a good place to see others creative thoughts and plans, though they may be not biz plan. The part of these plans owner do these plans to reality objects like Diaspora. We can learn from them.
