I'm thinking of about doing a subscription business relating to beer as a side project. I currently reside in Arizona but when it comes to it, I was leaning towards forming the LLC in Nevada. The Arizona state law prohibit selling alcohol online except for a few select wineries. I would assume this type of business would fall under that law and therefore cannot do it, but does that apply differently if it's an entirely online company?

My question is, if the LLC is formed in Nevada, I live in Arizona, do those same state laws apply to the foreign entity? I've coursed the Arizona State Legislature site and haven't really been able to come up with a direct answer. I did see that if you're a member of an LLC you may not even have to register as a foreign entity, but that's a question for a different time.

If you are working out of any building in Arizona (including your house) you will need to register in Arizona anyway. And Arizona may require it if you reside there. From the sound of things you would be better off consulting an attorney in each state.
