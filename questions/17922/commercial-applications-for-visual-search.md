[This is a video of the google goggles app][1] which does a good job of explaining what the current state of the art in visual search can do. [its also being applied to searching patents][2], [product classification based on appearance ][3]. [This startup is using it for product search. ][4]If you had a technology that when you click search takes approx 1 second to search 

 1. 10 million images
 2. 100 million images

what markets would you investigate? What pain points can you see it solving?

-Person identification - imagine the implications for fb profile photos

-Locations - for geolocation apps and travel companies

-Apparel - what are celebs wearing

Perhaps we finally have a way to help TSA learn to search for terrorists... Never mind... But it's a good demonstration of how prejudices are formed

I is required at a consumer level as well:
1. you want search your old buddies by faces,
2. Search a product by image when the same search via text is returning irrelevant results
3. Related pictures of monuments, birds, places


personally I think the best use of this technology is "PORNOGRAPHY BLOCKING"

makes sense?
