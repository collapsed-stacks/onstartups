I usually have the requirement to download some flash video to local disk and then look it because my bandwidth is too limited to make a fluid playing. So, I made up a software tool to achieve this task, now I want to market this piece of software, and I know it is useful and must can meet somebody's needs.
  But I am wondering whether these tools are legal? And I have seen some similar software to do this, and if software are legal, how is some website to do the same task?

Thanks a lot!

If it's not legal then Firefox, Chrome, IE, Opera, et al. are all breaking the law. You HAVE to download a Flash video file to your computer in order to play it. While that's not the main purpose of those browsers, and it isn't marketed as a Flash file downloader, that is what they are. In my inexpert opinion, the answer to your question is "no, it's not illegal".
