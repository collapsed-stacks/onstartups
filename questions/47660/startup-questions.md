I am working for simple desktop based application (windows). I would like to launch this application for free first and based on the customer response and for new features, I have plan to charge for it. Currently, I am only working on this project. My questions is,

Should I register for company or can I launch the product without registering the company.

Anyone please help me.

Thanks all.

Personally, I'd wait until you actually have a revenue stream. I have several small, free applications but no incorporation. It's just another thing you need to do and another cost at this point.

If you have paying clients, I'd register. It doesn't cost an arm and a leg and it can protect you.

The reason is, if something goes wrong with your app and a client of yours suffers damage, you can be sued personally and in theory, you can lose your house and savings due to something like that. A corporation, or LLC provides a legal shield between your clients and your personal assets.
