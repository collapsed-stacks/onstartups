It's getting a little difficult to come up with a domain name for a new idea I have. Most of the good names are either taken or parked. 

Is there a site I can use to get ideas for my domain names from other people or a software that helps me with good suggestions.

<p><a href="http://PickyDomains.com" rel="nofollow">PickyDomains.com</a> is a crowd-sourced domain name suggestion service. $50 for a bunch of suggestions, you only pay if you decide to use one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.leandomainsearch.com/" rel="nofollow">LeanDomainSearch.com</a> is the successor to Domain Pigeon. You enter a keyword, it pairs it with 1000 other keywords and tells you which .coms are available.</p>

<p><a href="http://Dotomator.com" rel="nofollow">Dotomator.com</a> is a nice word beginning / ending combinator.</p>

<p><a href="http://Dombuddy.com/generator" rel="nofollow">Dombuddy.com/generator</a> is another beginning / ending / wordlist combinator, and also has a random syllable domain name generator.</p>

<p><a href="http://Wordoid.com" rel="nofollow">Wordoid.com</a> is great for syllable-connected domains that "sound" English (or another chosen language), but that also contain a keyword you specify.</p>

<p><a href="http://stylate.com/" rel="nofollow">Stylate</a> is an interesting domain seller. They sell domains paired with logos for $250 - it's just enough of a value-add through curation of domains with potential and visual inspiration that I don't write them off as domain hoarders. <a href="http://namella.com" rel="nofollow">Namella</a> and <a href="http://www.launchkite.com/" rel="nofollow">Launchkite</a> are competitors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.namestation.com/" rel="nofollow">Namestation</a> is a recent tool that combines some of the best of automated-inspiration tools with public domain-suggestion contests.</p>

I tried http://www.wordoid.com/ when I was looking for a name. Although I ended up not using their suggestions, the site sure helps. I would also recommend checking for domain names with prefix "the" for the name you are thinking. For example our product name is Formspider but the domain name was taken. So we went with theformspider.com.

<p><a href="http://bustaname.com" rel="nofollow">Bustaname</a> is an awesome service for linking together keywords and generating random domain names. </p>

<p>If you feel that most of the good names are taken,</p>

<p><a href="http://launchkite.com/" rel="nofollow">Launchkite.com</a> is a directory listing of a bunch of awesome "pre-branded web 2.0" domain names. I paid $250 for a domain name and a logo for my startup, not a bad deal, and I got a pretty good name. If you're in the market, I'd recommended browsing what they have to offer. Sometimes you can find something better than those naming services can come up with. </p>
