I am a hobbists/hacker who is spending a non trival amount of time playing around with some web2.0 ideas that I hope to productize and launch one day.
I would like to somehow account for all these hours I am spending.


Should I register a company right now and become an employee or is it just a distraction?


Is there any benefits from a tax perspective? write off costs etc.

As long as the only thing you are spending on your project are "long hours", there is no tax benefit that you can get anyway, so who cares?

Usually, the main reasons to incorporate are:

 - to protect yourself from liability: if a customer is upset at you, they can't sue you personally and take your house
 - because the project has multiple people contributing, so who owns what and when needs to be formalized
 - to enter into deals or partnerships with other corporations

Earlier is better - get it out of the way if you have the time/resources, but the very latest BEFORE you take anyone's money (customer, investor, etc.). You need the protection. Unless you're planning to operate as a sole proprietor/contractor - you need to be operating from a business bank account with the protection of an LLC or Corp. Don't mix it with your personal life.

If it were me, I'd say **right now.**  If it were Alain, he'd [say](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/1832/when-does-it-make-sense-to-officially-register-a-company/1846#1846) **not now.**

At this point, it's a matter of personal preference.  When I decide to invest non-trivial time/money, I like to have things setup "right". It's kinda like... if you're a solo developer, do you setup issue tracking, SCM, etc?

It makes me "feel" like what I'm doing is more serious, plus it makes scaling a little easier. Not much easier, since you can always set this up later, but a little easier.

Of course, this is predicated on the fact that your jurisdiction doesn't charge an arm and a leg. In Ohio, it costs $125 to form a corporation, a EIN/TIN takes 5 minutes to get, and business bank accounts are free (and sometimes come with free checks). Plus, with hardly any income/expenses, you just do a Schedule C on your 1040.

It's needed if you are planning to enter into any relations with other companies. Many of them just won't work with individuals and besides that, being incorporated gives you additional protection in cases when your software caused some losses to your client/customer. 

In the USA, in some states they can go after your assets if you were operating as yourself rather than a company.  Having a company can give you some tax benefits too.
