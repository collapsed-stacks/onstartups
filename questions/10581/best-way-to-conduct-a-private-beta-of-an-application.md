I have an app which I'm looking to start in private beta testing soon, but I'm needing an application/cms to allow me to manage it (i.e. hand out codes, provide tickets, help centre). Any ideas? **Preferably would be open source and ideally free.**

Thanks.

<p><a href="http://uservoice.com/" rel="nofollow">UserVoice.com</a> and <a href="http://GetSatisfaction.com" rel="nofollow">GetSatisfaction.com</a> are good for getting feedback on a beta application.</p>

<p>We're looking at using <a href="http://www.prefinery.com/" rel="nofollow">Prefinery</a> to launch a private beta in June. According to their web site, they offer tickets, etc. </p>

<p>I've heard good things about it and would be interested in your experience. </p>

<p>Oli mentioned UserVoice and GetSatisfaction. Here is a <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/329/uservoice-or-getsatisfaction" rel="nofollow">question</a> from this site that compares the two.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zendesk.com" rel="nofollow">Zendesk</a> isn't free, but it's also a customer-support centric system.  Its main strength is a strong ticketing system for individual customer issues.  There's also a forum, the ability to put up help articles, etc.  I would recommend this if you have a small number of beta testers that you expect to give lots of individual attention to.  For larger groups, GetSatisfaction helps in building communities rather than organizing individuals.</p>

Zendesk is definitely the choice for a ticketing system...we use it internally for bugs.  If you're looking to collect feedback and get a sense of what people want to see in your product, UserVoice is the simplest solution for your end-users.  You integrate the feedback form wherever is best for you and your customers can easily submit and vote on ideas (even using the login credentials from your own site, if you'd like).

If anyone has any questions about UserVoice feel free to drop me a line.  Also, we do have a 50% discount for startups for the first 12 months.  Just enter the code onstartups101 when signing up to get that discount.
