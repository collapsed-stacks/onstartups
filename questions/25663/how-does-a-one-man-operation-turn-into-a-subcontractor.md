I've been working with contracting companies for about 6 years now and was wondering how I can go about becoming a contractor. 

I reside in Atlanta, GA and have an IT background (virtualization/cloud computing) and eventually would like to start my own company.  I can't just quit and start doing it so a smoother transitional plan will be required.  

Is this as simple as working as a 1099 under my company name for a big contractor and building up experience?  Any suggestions will be appreciated.  Please feel free to ask me for more info.  I didn't want to get too long winded right from the start.  Thanks!

I worked with a "company" for a year and all of their employees were contractors. I believe (now please correct me if I am wrong) to be a contractor the only thing truly needed is a 1099 MISC. However, I don't really know about what it takes if you are going to turn your "business" into an LLC.
