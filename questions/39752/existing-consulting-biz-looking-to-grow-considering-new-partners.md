This is a difficult question(s) to get in a succinct message. 

I run a profitable consulting firm since 2003, specializing in IT consulting. We focus on 1 'package' from a large software company today & are looking to expand into new software packages via alliances. My business is a single-member LLC today, and I contract out the work to a core group of consultants that I've worked with for numerous years. We're all independent, and it's my job to do the business development for these resources.

Getting into the new 'markets' for us will require a lot of capital (training, certifications, travel, alliance fees, etc.). We are also looking to outsource some biz-dev to a 3rd party, which would be a 10x increase over our existing sales budget. Most of our clients today are word-of-mouth or repeat clients. 

The opportunity is to leverage the other contractors for capital (they have it & are interested) - to help fund these new opportunities. The downside is these guys are 'grinders' and not 'finders.' I've tried compensating them for new biz-dev, leads, etc - but to date it doesn't change any behavior. They are happy just taking work & not developing the business. 

I'm worried about opening the kimono & having partners that would essentially be 'silent' from a firm development standpoint - but I could really make use of their cash. My 'advisory board' suggested a few options, which all seem very complex. My goal is to keep the structure relatively simple, maintain my firms existing client contracts, and not give away the farm for nothing. 

Some ideas include: 

1. Having the contractors invest / loan money with some guaranteed return + upside if the investment really pays out. 
2. Creating a JV for the new markets with the interested parties. Splitting the returns in some fashion (though I'm still interested in a majority stake).
3. Same concept, only using a Series-LLC structure for the new markets to protect my existing brand / equity
4. Opening the door to Equity Partnership, if the prospective partners can demonstrate they can bring new business to the firm, contribute in other non-billable ways, etc.

Ultimately, we want to hire FT employees to build an 'associate' base...but the prospects of hiring to me are very scary. To date, if business dries up - I have no committments to the team. If I have FTE's...then I'm really on the hook. 

The interested contractors are highly compensated today, so bringing them on as FTE's isn't that attractive to them. They are highly skilled & specialized, and I've built a solid reputation leveraging these resources, where the competition fills spots with rookies. I want to keep them involved, actively building the company - but I know most of them won't end up producing much in the way of new revenues. But, using their cash as leverage & keeping them 'close' in a way that maintains my delivery advantage seems critical. 

Many thanks for any suggestions...

Limited partnership or similar arrangement where the limited partners put in cash and get some equity.

Figure out something fair and durable and hire a lawyer to document it if you're serious about avoiding litigation or disputes later.
