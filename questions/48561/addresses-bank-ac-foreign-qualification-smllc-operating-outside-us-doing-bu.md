I am Single member LLC operating from India. While incorporating there are some addresses to be filled up.

1. Registered Agent : That would be simply RA's address. It will be provided by them. No confusion.

2. Legal Address/ Physical address of the Principal base : **Would it be my Indian address?** OR
Can it be business mailing address (the one provided by mail-forwarding services). If I put some other state in US(say Oregon- i know somebody there), Would my LLC be "Foreign Qualified" then in Oregon?

3. Mailing address: Can it be located outside Delaware? Since this is a mailing address merely, i assume this has nothing to do with Foreign qualification.

BANK ACCOUNT: Do I need to open merchant Bank A/C in state-Delaware itself for avoiding Foreign qualification in other state.
