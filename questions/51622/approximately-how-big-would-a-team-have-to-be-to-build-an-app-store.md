<p>Approximately how many people it would take to build a fully functional app store from scratch? I'm not asking for an exact number. I'm asking about a range that is realistic to build something following these guidelines. </p>

<ul>
<li>If the project had to be completed in a year or less</li>
<li>If everyone would work a standard 8 hour day</li>
<li>The store would need to be as functional as current stores which
include:
<ul>
<li>Ability to manage products and allow users to add new products</li>
<li>Allow users to add rating and feedback</li>
<li>Include a secure and reliable payment system</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Using popular app stores as an example, how many employees did it take to complete the project?</p>
