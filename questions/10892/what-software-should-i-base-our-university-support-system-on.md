## What software should I base our university support system on?

We have a software application used by engineers.  We have a university program where we provide our software to universities at low cost and have pretty good traction in this market but I feel we need to do more on the support side.

It's not practical for us to have students use the support system we provide to our commercial customers (we don't have the manpower) so we would like to develop a separate support system for students.  I'm thinking along the lines of a place where student could post questions and we (or other students) could answer them.  Ideally we could seed them system with common questions we know will come up.

A system like this one that has good support for attachments (almost all questions regarding our software require that you attach a document) would work well.

I had thought of stack exchange but that no longer seems like an option.  I've considered a wiki like confluence which would be good for posting FAQ type info but not good for asking questions (at least from what I know about it).  I've looked at bulletin board software but it seems like a crude way to solve this problem.

Does anyone know of any software we could base this system on?

Since this is for university students there are a few extra requirements

 - we can't really use a system that has per-user fee. The system does not need to be free but should charge on a basis that allows us to open it to infrequent student users
 - users need to be able to self register
 - needs to be easy to use
