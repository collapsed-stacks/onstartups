I'm a complete web/entrepreneur rookie with an idea that I believe in passionately and don't know where to begin.  I know for a fact that my idea is unique and will fill a huge hole in the market and that with the right marketing and buzz it could be amazingly popular and successful.  The actual website concept is extremely involved with a huge amount of work and data and will need tons of research, writing, tweaking etc. before it can launch. 

I have been doing some research here and there for over a year but I get frazzled when I try to attempt to begin to make the idea a reality.  I have a domain, I found the required software (I think), and that's about it.  I have never had an idea that I have had so much confidence in that I wanted to execute it and I am going to make it happen no matter what so I don't need to do market research etc.  I just need to know how to move forward as a single entrepreuner with zero web or business startup experience.  

What I really want to do is find a developer that I can work with on a very personal level to just start making the site and then making changes as we plug along.  

I have marketing/advertising experience as an account manager, and a tiny bit of Wordpress experience.  I am a writer by trade as well and have tons of experience writing web content, site navigation outlines, press releases, technical articles etc. so I'm okay in that department to start out.  I have a relatively small budget and limited resources. I know that I sound like such a newb but I have to start somewhere.  Where do I begin?

This is true for just about every idea out there. If it worked for the Pet Rock, it could work for anyone.

> need tons of research, writing, tweaking etc. before it can launch.

Probably not as much as you think. Many people test the waters with just a landing page. Get something built and in front of users.

Start local. What's the closest university with a CS program? Are there any meetups for tech entrepreneurs in your area? 

Most sites are built with: PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python or Microsoft ASP.NET. Find a "how to" book or site and get started.
