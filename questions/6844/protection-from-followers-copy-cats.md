<p>You can't - no matter what the idea, if there isn't someone doing it already, there soon will be. You need to make sure that you do the best job you can, that you keep ahead of the others, that you offer something that you are uniquely positioned to do.</p>

<p>I wrote a few articles about this:</p>

What you need to do is something similar to what Apple does with new products.  Protect every aspect from leaking and only once you are ready for a full release do you allow any information to be released.  Anyone you discuss the project with needs to sign a confidentiality disclosure agreement (CDA).  Patents on software are very difficult to justify, obtain and retain because of the specificity required will ultimately exclude the patent from protecting future developments/innovations
