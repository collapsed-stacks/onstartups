I left my job to join an early stage startup at its absolute infancy.  I came on board immediately in a biz dev role and am one of only two full-time employees.  The other is the actual CEO, the 3rd is part time, but investing to cover overheads (office rental, initial marketing, etc...), and a fourth part-timer is only working for 3 months as a project lead for our tech development (which is also outsourced).  

We're doing a 4-year vested interest schedule, with 1 year cliff.  The idea is to offer me 5% founders equity, but I feel that this is much lower than it should be.  As a full-time member that is unpaid, and unsure as to when we will receive funding (we don't launch for another couple of months), I feel my risk is also very high, despite not funding the runway.  As one of the people that may not have directly had the idea, but still involved within the first 10 days with no clear finish line to funding, shouldn't I be compensated with higher equity until we receive Series A?  There is talk about holding as much as 50% for first round investors, but I haven't asked to see the division of the pie yet until I had a better idea of what my expectations should be.

<p>For starters, see <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/12079/is-it-typical-to-trade-salary-for-equity-when-joining-a-startup/12084#12084" rel="nofollow">Apollo's devils advocate view on options</a> (a view I share).</p>

<p>It's damn hard to give good advice in this situation, so don't take this for more than it is. a) The information you're passing on may be biased, in which case you'll get biased responses. b) There is lots of information we don't have (like the business plan, your track record, etc).</p>

<p>But having said that, my clear initial response is ... you're getting screwed. As you are getting no salary, you're a cofounder. And cofounders generally get equal equity, unless:</p>

<ul>
<li>they will clearly have dramatically different impacts on the venture (think 20 year veteran of the industry with deep knowledge versus young kid with a lackluster track record).</li>
<li>are putting in quite different levels of effort, i.e. one is full time and another is part-time in the evenings, or one is bringing work+cash and the other only work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless I would say that the minimal ownership stake for a co-founder (when fully vested) is 20% of the initial shares. (Keep in mind that as you're looking for VC money, your ownership % will get diluted quite hard.) Everyone should want all co-founders to feel maximally committed to the venture; and not waste energy on being jealous or feeling that it isn't really their baby.</p>

<p>Also, the whole "lots of management types early on, and offshore development" spiel sounds suspect. That often ends in failure -- too top heavy early on, and often bespeaks a CEO who has spent years in large companies and who thinks having "important meetings" is what work is all about. </p>

<p>Now, I don't know -- does the market potential seem <strong>huge</strong>, i.e. with your 5% you could potentially easily buy a 300-foot yacht and houses on each continent? I'm taken back by the fact that 4 people are going along with this. Clearly that CEO is one charismatic dude, or perhaps there is something more to the story? Or maybe I'm just over-thinking this aspect, and you're getting screwed...</p>

<p>How much money is going to those overseas developers? If we're talking 1.000 - 20.000 USD for version 1.0, then the hole thing sounds dead wrong. Not much defensible Intellectual Property in that, and way way too much management early on, so general cluelessness about startups.</p>

<p>If we're taking well above 100.000 USD for version 1, and unique patentable technology or some other strong competitive advantage, then it makes more sense -- and your small ownership percentage is more justifiable (though still too low IMHO).</p>

Yep, you're getting screwed.  5% is a joke.  Realize that your services are valuable, and realize how unfundable they are if you don't perform.  The need to come up with a stipend or up the equity.
