I am from India and I am owner of a Pvt Ltd company, we deal in software, web development, hosting, server administration. We are successfully in business from last 5 years. These many years we got our work from our existing contacts. Now we want to expand the business and hence are looking for more work. We don't have any new contacts from where we can build any business relation with a new company to gain a project. Can anyone please help me in right direction to find a company, a professional who can search projects for me in USA, UK, Australia etc.

What I need is they will find the work on basis of their network and represent my company to the client. If my company gets the project they will get their payment or % in the amount of the work.

This is my concept for which I dont know if any professional or a company is present or dont know I am just wrong totally. But if someone knows anything about this please help me in the right direction.

Yes, there are such consultants. They belong to two categories:

 1. leeches: they will offer their "services" and try to get as much cash from you, without having to deliver any results. They tend to over-promise and severely under-deliver. They don't have a clue what your product is about.

 2. legitimate distributors/reps: they have a good network, know potential customers and understand your business very well.

The challenge is to figure out who is who. By far, the best way to find such a person is through a common acquaintance. The second best way is to make sure they have sold similar products in the past and overall seem to know more about your market than you do. That would be a good sign. If they try to impress you with vague knowledge of the US market in general, run :-)
