I'm having a small start-up web design & development company. All we have is website. Now we are having some big clients and are getting good projects now and then. It's Run by me & my partner. We are the only one who work. We are thinking of registering it, start a small office etc... What will be the procedure? What all will have to do? How will we keep records?
We can't afford to have employs and all at this stage. 

This is the site. [http://tridz.com][1]

Research and think carefully about the structure you want to choose for your company.  Depending where you are at, you'll have the option to incorporate as a separate entity; form a partnership; or go it as a sole proprietor.   You may want to see an experienced accountant to consult with you on the best most practical setup.  

Next, inevitably, you'll want to grow your fundamental knowledge in accounting, bookkeeping, and your country's tax laws.  You'll want to keep detailed info on all your transactions and eventually improve & implement procedures to organize & monitor this data effectively (as Joel suggested, Freshbooks.com is a good start). 

Regardless of whether you 'enjoy' accounting, bookkeeping, and tax - this is a vital aspect of your business; and can make up for the largest chunk of your total business expenses so you better had manage it well.  And it's much easier if you're organized from the start.

From there it's all about creating value for your clients and marketing yourself to new ones.  Goodluck.

Esafwan the web site looks great.  You dont have to be in the USA to have us clients.  I would create a profile on Odesk and try to build a repuation there.  Ad skype and a USA number phone number to your site.

I would sell the benefits of being offshore.

If you want to be in the USA to attract sales, then look for a partner in the USA and commission him/her on sales leads.

Ok, i dont even know where Calicut is - you dont provide and sensible full information. What country is +91?

Anyhow, contact your TOWN HALL and ASK THEM. Alternatively as a lawyer. Also make sure you know what laws govern websites - in all countries I deal with, yours would be illegal, businesses must provide full contact information (address etc.), like on company letterhead.

But at the end of the day, businesses get reigstered plenty every day, so it is a standardized process that your town hall will easily know about. Or any not totally brain dead lawyer in the business area. And having a lawye is the basics anyway. And an accountant. And knowing how to write invoices ;)

In most places you need to create a legal company of sorts, as already mentioned by others, it is specific to your locale (an accountant may be a good source of advice).  

For keeping records, I personally like FreshBooks (www.freshbooks.com), it's a pretty simple way of tracking income and expenses.

I also like google apps to manage the domain, email, file repository, calendar, etc.  The free option is pretty good for a small business, and allows you to setup email addresses like info@tridz.com, support@tridz.com and have both you and your partner receive these.
