It seems like most startups on Twitter use one of two strategies:

1) Broadcast links & information about the company.

2) Broadcast links & information about the industry related to the company.

Or a combination of both, in many cases.

I'm interested to hear if anyone knows of unique strategies that you've seen startups -- or even just businesses in general -- use on Twitter.

I think using the word "broadcast" is not the best Twitter strategy.

A good strategy uses Twitter to *connect* to customers and potential customers.  Of course you'll broadcast things like interesting links, but what about RT'ing things your customers or followers say which are interesting to others, thus connecting people to each other and rewarding them for talking with you?

Best is if you empower people with new ideas, tools, techniques, and connections.

If you think of Twitter (or a blog) as a way to establish expertise and create a group of people who trust you and to some extent each other, that creates the "valuable thing" which then leads them to your product or service.

I know this guy who was making twitter backgrounds for celebrities (for free) to initiate a conversation and then politely asking them to take a few snapshots of celebrities endorsing his products. The guy then plans to use those images to boost his marketing efforts.

I found this one interesting: http://bit.ly/5mqylr

Basically the strategy is to tweet when you are in a venue and show that to the waiter and get free stuff. The venue spends little -maybe a coffee or beer-, and gets publicity in exchange. Don't know if this ultimately works, and it probably is difficult to measure conversion rates, but it's definitely creative.

<p>I've seen <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/13/sonos-s5-music/" rel="nofollow">some companies</a> run <strong>contests</strong>/<strong>give-aways</strong> that required participants to either follow or retweet them. If the price is worth it, it can create a huge viral loop.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com" rel="nofollow">SitePoint</a> gave away a free eBook for following them on Twitter.</p>

Interesting people, with something interesting to say in an interesting way. No one wants to hear from a company. It's like getting a form letter in the mail.
