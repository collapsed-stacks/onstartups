Let me start by giving a quick intro to myself.  I've worked as a Technician for hosting companies, Systems Administrator for software development companies, as a CTO for a very successful online marketing company.

At this point I would like to start my own company.  I want to take on a challenge, and I want to do something exciting.  My question is, based on the above information, what would you consider a smart choice for a new online business.  Some examples would be:  "Develop and sell iPhone applications", "Start a data hosting service using cloud technologies", etc.  I would like to avoid web hosting, web design, and graphic design...

Excited to hear your feedback, thanks!

<p>I don't think you should start a company unless and until you are driven by a very compelling reason to build something specific to address a burning need in the market. Why not expose yourself to other entrepreneurs who may have a big idea but lack the technical talent to realize it? It might be worth attending a few meetups for entrepreneurs and startups like <a href="http://opencoffeeclub.ning.com" rel="nofollow">opencoffee</a> and office hour sessions with some early-stage VCs to see if you come across a potential partner with a great idea and some complementary skills.</p>

Maybe you could help companies that want their data in the cloud and onsite - a hybrid. Seems like everyone shows benefits of one over the other, why not have both?
