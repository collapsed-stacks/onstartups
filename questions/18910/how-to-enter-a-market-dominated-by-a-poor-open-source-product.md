## How to enter a market dominated by a poor Open-Source product

An established but somehow abandoned open-source project dominates a niche market. 

We wonder why users recommend this software everywhere as it is ridiculuosly complicated and geeky to configure. I am a developer but have to give up trying to configure it with creepy config text file config.

It must be the irrational "Open-source must be good because it is open-source" thing.

For strange reasons, the project leaders promise for years(!) that the software will be updated to the best and easiest-to-use software in the world. Perhaps to make their "Donate"-button glow by spreading hope?! - I don't know. The project team reformed several times but the software has not seen any real update for a long time. 

We are now preparing to launch a commercial product in that niche that actually delivers what the OSS guys promise.

Technology-, usability- and design-wise it will instantly blow any competition away but how to beat this "brain-dead" open-source project? It really walks around like a Zombie in all computer forums.

Would a "free for personal use" a good approach to fight against the $0 price tag of the open source competitor?

Any other good ideas?

If your product is as superior as you claim, I'm sure you'll have no problem with the open source product. Most companies will prefer to use the superior product, and pay for it if they have to. (I'm assuming this is B2B, people are a bit different, and personally I have less experience with B2C).

To gain traction you're essentially going overcome two things:<br>
1) The accepted of the **De-facto standard**.<br>
2) **Legacy**.

The first adresses entrants to the niche market. What product will they choose, and why? Whenever I go looking for something new, I ask around what other use. With a shortlist of popular products, I evaluate those. So, how do you gain traction? Well...

The second adresses changing the opinions of the existing customer base in the market. If I were you, I'd try to identify a group of leading customers of the OSS product and contact them directly, with an offer of 1 year free usage, free integration – all for **an endorsement** for you to use on your website. "We changed X for Y and BOY ARE WE HAPPY!"

Nail the social proof, and then leverage that with your new market entrants.

Finally, I'd like to leave you with a word of caution. Be very humble with how "bad" the competitors are, and how great you are. Even when they're crappy OSS products with crazy slow release and update cycles...

Are you really, really sure the customers dislike the product *enough*? Is is really cumbersome enough? I mean, personally, I HATE excel. However, I still use it, even though there are Google Docs, Apple Numbers, Open Office etc. It's just not bad enough, (and people still send me those darned proprietary .xls files).

Sometimes the amount of pain customers are willing to accept for the crappy products is just amazing.

Best of luck!

I agree with everything that John Sjölander wrote. Adding much more is hard without knowing more about the software/market in question... but a one random thought:

In my experience one of the things that motivates software projects - open source or otherwise - is competition. Something to bear in mind is that the open source product may not stay feature deficient once there is another entry in the market.

I'd have that in your plans if I were you :-)

You have got to add a unique feature, preferably something that solves a real problem. Also good if that feature is difficult to program so the competiton cannot quickly add it. People do not switch to a new software unless there is a really compelling reason- it has to be more than just better, like holy *&^) this thing is incredible, type of better.

I bought the XMLMax editor. It’s a good example of an individual having success in a well-established market with both OS and commercial competition. I bought it because it is the only program that can handle the huge xml files we process daily( 500mb and up) and its speed relative to everything else is stunning. They focus on that feature and being a developer I wager it was not easy to develop.

I am sometimes the author of such OSS software, they earn peanuts from donate buttons.
You can probably offer them some moneys to do some research on what type of people are using their products, what features they use, etc.

If you say you've given up installing it, you could be missing something there.  There're lots of badly documented software out there but sometimes you may wonder into another site with simple instructions/samples that make things easier.

There may also be other dependent softwares/addons that need the software installed to work.
