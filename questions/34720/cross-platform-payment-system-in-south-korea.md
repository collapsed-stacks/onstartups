I am planning to have an online business targeting **South Korea**.

It seems that most Korean payment gateways **only** support Internet Explorer and Windows. It is severely limited for other browser and platform users to access to most Korean commercial websites. But I would like to support to all users.

I found a couple of cross-browser/platform Korean payment gateways, but they are more expensive than others. (fee for each transaction 3.5-3.8%, while regular payment gateways pay around 3.1-3.4%)

Would there be a solution for this?
Would there be a better way to use a foreign payment gateway?

<p>I happened to answer my own question.</p>

<p>Although the transaction fee is not low (3.5%), <a href="http://paygate.net" rel="nofollow">PayGate</a> seems to be a great choice. It has some fairly decent insurance policy suitable for small business companies and startups. Moreover, the initial cost and annual fee is only 100,000 won (less than $100).</p>

<p>In addition, I believe this is <strong>the only</strong> Korean payment gateway that supports cross-browser and cross-platform payment services. I at first did not trust this payment gateway, but some trusted Korean websites use this (<a href="http://aladin.co.kr" rel="nofollow">Aladin Bookstore</a>, Apple Korea)</p>

<p>As an alternative, but still in incubator, <a href="https://developer.mastercard.com/portal/display/api/Payments" rel="nofollow">MasterCard Payments</a> seems to be great because I believe it's going to be cheaper, support Korean currency, and cross-platform. If this is officially released, we are planning to reconsider our payment system.</p>
