I've asked a couple of questions before but I don't think I'm asking the *right* question...

App developers - Would you be interested in marketing services for your applications? 

I am an experienced social media/internet marketer for retail clients, but am looking to develop a startup that markets apps. I've done lots of research on what works and what doesn't and I'll have an array of services to offer at all different levels of pricing. I also hope to market to my retail clients to get apps developed for their brands in which case I can hand them off to developers at a small % commission. Is this something developers would be interested in?

There are two kinds of developers: those that have trouble marketing, and those that find marketing easy.

Those that find marketing easy don't need your service.

Those that have trouble marketing can't afford your service.

So, it's a Catch-22. If I were you I would spend a couple of days looking for an application that you think you could really make a big difference on, and contact the developer and offer some kind of partnership.

I might be interested in something like that, but I am immediately skeptical; you will have to prove it to the devs that you actually can sell the project.

I have been trying to do it the other way. I develop a project and then look for marketing people to sell it for a large commission. I suppose we both have the same problem: proving to the other side that the idea is viable.

Anyway, I would be interested in hearing more about your plan. mattm184 at gmail.

I would add up to Joel Spolsky's answer, and Mongus Pong's comment. I am also into the category 2 and so are lot of other app developers. 

Looking at this, launching a website for app marketing business, where you help app developers in marketing their apps on commission basis would work. 

Also, you can do a tie up with an app development company to get apps developed as per your/customer requirements.

And believe me, there is really a need of budget app marketing company, that can really bring in sales.
