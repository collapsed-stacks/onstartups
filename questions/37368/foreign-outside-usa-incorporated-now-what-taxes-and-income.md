Can someone describe me how I should pay taxes being foreign, any basic guide? 
If I can't perceive any salary, how do I make money as a shareholder (not american)?

More details: I'm in Mexico. Well, not yet incorporated, but incorporation is too easy to do online, that is almost a fact. 

It would be located in Nevada.

Regards.

<p>If you are a foreigner and receive income in the US you will receive the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRS_tax_forms" rel="nofollow">form 1099</a> very likely either 1099-DIV or 1099-MISC.  Once received you being a foreign citizen you will need to file <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1042.pdf" rel="nofollow">Form 1042</a> to the IRS and you will need to file something similar to the <a href="http://www.sat.gob.mx/sitio_internet/home.asp" rel="nofollow">Mexican Tax Authority</a> reporting income you received abroad and based on the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/mexico.pdf" rel="nofollow">double taxation treaty</a> you will receive credit for taxes paid to the US if any in Mexico.</p>

<p>There may be some tax implications under NAFTA but I am yet to locate relevant info.</p>
