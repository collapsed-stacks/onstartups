I had an employment agreement with a company that stated my equity (based  on shares vesting over a 4-year period) would continue to be honored until up to 120 days after my departing the company.  I am fully vested.  On June 1st I was fired (without cause) and in July the company announced to the board that they have found a buyer and a deal that the BOD approved.  They then stated they were going to wait till October to close the deal because thats when my rght to my shares would expire.

Is this legal?  Do I have any recourse?  They are clearly delaying the sale to deprive me of my equity.

Can you exercise your options now? That way you own the shares and don't need to worry about expiration.
