Other than google alerts...

I'd like to know anytime "StarStreet" "sports stock market" "starstreetsports.com" are mentioned. Anything out there I should be using in addition to google alerts?

<p>Everyone personal or business should be using <a href="http://search.twitter.com" rel="nofollow">search.twitter.com</a>. Think about periphery keywords (curiosity keywords), locations, emotions, etc (see advanced options) that may not directly create "marks" for you to engage with but more pull you into conversations that build your knowledge of landscape and the people moving with in it.</p>

<p>Of course there are plenty more which I look forward to seeing on this page.</p>

I know you mentioned monitoring your brand for marketing/customer support reasons, but there is also the option to monitor them against security threats (stolen, hacked, etc).

If you are looking for security monitoring of your brand/domains/sites, I would suggest http://sucuri.net (Internet Presence Monitor) --my company, so I am a bit biased :)

What we do:

> Domain stolen, blacklisted, hosting
> malware? Unaware?
> 
> Protect your brand, your site and your
> customers. Avoid any traffic loss from
> being blacklisted.
> 
> Our Web Integrity Monitor solution
> will detect unauthorized changes to
> your web sites, DNS, Whois or SSL
> certificates.
> 
> Be notified instantly via email or
> twitter if your site is hosting
> malware, blacklisted, hacked or
> unavailable.

We also monitor the "underground" to see if your site is being used in phishing attempts, etc...
