Currently I am holding around 80,000 warrants of my previous U.S based product company. Still company is privately held by the promoters only and they do not have any plan for IPO in next 1-2 yrs. FYI: Company is making a lot of profit.

So by chance if company won't go for Public offer in future, then how can I exercise my warrants?

Thanks
With Regards
Santosh

You look at the terms of the warrant and do what it says to exercise them.  Typically, you send them a check and they send you share certificates.

But, realistically, unless the warrant is soon to expire or the company is paying (or about to pay) dividends, you probably want to hold off on doing it -- you'd be spending money and, in return, getting something that you can't easily sell and provides you no clear benefit.
