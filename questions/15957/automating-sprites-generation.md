## Automating sprites generation

Using sprites is a great way to reduce server requests, which will lead to overall site performance. There are a few online tools that help you generate sprites, both images and accompanying CSS, however if an image dimensions are changed or it is renamed, the whole site can get affected.

In order to avoid this mess I've read some people proposed certain naming conventions and even directory structure, that allows certain scripts to dynamically generate sprites and CSS. 

Does anyone know more about this? I think this is a great idea and if there's a way to automate the process that would be very cool.

Why am I posting this here? Because it has to do with productivity tools, something start-ups rely on a lot.

Thanks.

Aptimize does a great job for CSS Automation for IIS7.  I am sure there is a similar tool for Apache.  This is a post that would be best on StackOverflow.com
