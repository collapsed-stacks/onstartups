I'm in the awkward position my company is small, and my product is something almost totally aimed at massive medical corporations. They are _very_ unfriendly and closed to simply phoning up and asking for a chat :)

Are there good sites specifically for asking about advice and maybe even where people can practice pitching, ask for review of their skills/technique, etc?

It seems a site where we can practice calling other companies would be great for building experience and confidence.

I would actually recommend a different approach than a website forum.  You need to practice your pitch face-to-face to build confidence. Attend industry conferences where your targeted customers will be in attendance and start networking.  Build relationships with these people and then and only then ask some of them that you are comfortable with to listen to and critique your pitch based on their industry knowledge and experience.

Hope this helps.
