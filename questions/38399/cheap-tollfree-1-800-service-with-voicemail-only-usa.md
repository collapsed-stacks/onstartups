I'm looking for a service that gives me a 1-800/1-877/1-888/etc. number and voicemail for it.

That's it - don't want it to ring through, follow me, etc.  Just take a voicemail if someone calls and let me retrieve that voicemail.  

I've found a few places but they're $35 a month or so and that seems ridiculous.  I was hoping for more like $5/month :-)  

Anyone have any other recommendations?

VoIP.ms best and cheapest . I have tried over half of the providers and most of them just resell VoIP.ms with less option and more marketing

I used a service for $10 or $24 a month. you can check grasshopper.com. The features are pretty awesome. I think you going to love it.

Very useful features:
-You can receive faxes with the same number.
-Your voicemail converts to an email in text and mp3.
