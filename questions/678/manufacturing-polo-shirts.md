We need to find someone in the UK who can tell/show us how to make small batches of polo shirts.

The best option is to find someone in locally that you can establish an ongoing relationship with. Make friends, promise repeat business... it makes them much more likely to give you decent pricing on small runs.

Every city has dozens of small clothing shops.

I am torn - Spreadshirt is a good option. Just make SURE you see a sample of the finished product if you're buying more than a couple. I ended up with $700 worth of screwed up shirts and the CEO and Customer Service wouldn't return my calls.
