I have a unique and viable idea but no seed money. I also have low qualification (no college education) so no chance of funding by VCs.

I am aware of many programs by US and other governments. Are there any similar programs in INDIA?

<p>The Government of India has setup a <a href="http://www.cgtmse.in/" rel="nofollow">Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises</a>. </p>

<p>It provides guarantee for loans upto 1 Core rupees based purely on your business plan. Also if your loan amount is less, you wont be charged anything if your startup fails. Its very much like a grant. </p>

<p>Also, there are many other schemes. You can look <a href="http://www.dare.co.in/funding/miscellaneous/government-funding-for-technology-startups.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more information. </p>

<p>Hope this was helpful.</p>
