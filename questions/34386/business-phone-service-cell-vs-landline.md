My understanding is that consumer landline use is steadily dropping off, but I'm wondering for a business where emergency service is not required, customers getting a voicemail is okay, etc --why would a business need landline services?

Reasons I'm able to think of, though just ideas, not based on real research:

 - Device maintance cost (meaning mobile devices are not designed for a high number of calls)
 - Sound Quality, connection (copper/optic vs spectrum)
 - Sound Quality, device (mic sampling/connect)
 - Network reliablity
 - Call routing (onsite/offsite routing latency)

Clearly the service/carrier, device, location, etc. impact this; for example, I recall a story about iPhone service in NYC where ATT gave free mobile cell over IP devices to companies due to poor service, and clearly being out in the middle on nowhere would be problematic. That said, I'm wondering for the average small business with a high call volume if being pure mobile still does not make sense, and if so, why?

My business continues to use several landlines for the following reasons:

 1. **Sound quality.** No cell phone comes close to a landline in sound quality. We have had numerous calls from customers on cell phones that were completely unintelligible. It becomes tedious to ask them to repeat something over and over again. Many have had to call back on a landline.
 2. **Pricing.** Landlines are less expensive than cell phones for both the cost of service and the cost of the phones. In addition, tha average lifespan of a cell phone is around 2 years, while the average lifespan of a landline phone is over 10 years.
 3. **Reliability.** Landlines almost never fail, don't drop calls, and let you hook into numerous aftermarket products.
 4. **Phone Directories**  Cell phones, by default are not listed in phone directories. If your business uses only a cell phone, how can customers look up your phone number?
