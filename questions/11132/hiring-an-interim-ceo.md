Who's going to replace him after?

Or you are need him to sell the company?

Shed some light please.

@JohnWasham is wrong on this. It's a great idea to hire an interim CEO.  They are very dedicated to the startup's mission because they get their next interim CEO assignment based on how well they have done their prior assignments.  I've done 10 interim CEO assignments in the last 10 years.  Some times I come in while a search is going on for a permanent CEO.  This allows you to take as much time as you need to find the perfect permanent CEO.  I've written a series of short blog posts on interim management. Check them out at www.ChangeAgentDes.com

Yes, however I would rather choose a CEO carefully, even if it took longer, and have them vested for the long haul.  I'm not certain that a temporary key member is going to be dedicated to the startup's mission.

Sure, why not? :-) Not entirely sure what they'd do in just 3 months unless they're covering for an absence or filling a seat whilst someone else works out their notice etc.  There are a number of organisations around who specialise in placing interim 'C' level roles.
