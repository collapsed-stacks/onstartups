I wanted pointers to documents, blogs, website, etc. where there is detailed step by step instructions on important steps required for building and launching successful web startup.(if possible also templates or listing of web services that can help)
 
e.g.

1. Idea Evaluation: Evaluate your tech ideas on these 10 factors and then choose the best idea to work on. If there is excel template for scoring the idea the better.

2. Market Research: After shortlisting the most promising idea. Do market research for the idea to identify the need, potential etc. Best way to do this is to focus group/brainstorm the idea with targeted segment. Do a survey (use web service like surveymonkey, wufoo to create surveys) etc.

3. And so forth .....

This will be a great resource to all budding entrepreneurs.
 
Thanks in advance for your help,
 
Regards
