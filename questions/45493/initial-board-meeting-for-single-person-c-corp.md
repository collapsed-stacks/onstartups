Is it unnecessary to have a board meeting (meeting minutes) when it's just a single person in the newly formed company (Delaware c-corp)? 

Should you issue yourself shares immediately upon incorporation or can it wait until right before the next financing round?

Sole directors of corporations (Delaware or otherwise) commonly act by written consent in lieu of a meeting.
