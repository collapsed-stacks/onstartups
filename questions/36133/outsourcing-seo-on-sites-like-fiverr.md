I saw a lot of posts on Fiverr where people who offer creating 1000's of backlinks to your website for a pretty low price. 

 1. Is it a good way to improve my SEO? 
 2. Is it safe to use this technique? I know Google like to ban sites that get a lot of backlinks instantly.

You get what you pay for. In this case, you'll get someone using an automated tool to post spammy links and messages on forums and blogs that aren't moderated well. If that's the image that you want for your business, go for it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want to have a serious business. It's the digital equivalent to having someone spray paint your business name on the sides of buildings, except in this case the buildings are other people's websites.

Will Google catch on? Maybe, maybe not today, but if they can't detect it now, I wouldn't put it past them in the future. Whatever short term gains you get from it won't outweigh the long-term costs to your business and reputation.

I got a lot of spam-like emails from SEO sites so finally I decided to ask my questions and got on a call with one of them, the largest SEO company in India they said.
Here are some things they do that don't violate any of Google rules:

1. They submit your site to directories, manually
2. If you have original content like articles, they submit your article for consideration to various publications, again manually
3. They add your site to a few "directory sites" they own (gray area here in terms of quality of backlinks).

I hired a media/pr freelancer to work on #2 (these guys work on retainer, and dont guarantee results so not cheap) and didn't quite get results I had hoped for. 

My point is - whenever you hire someone to do something critical to your business you need to understand the task well and set expectations on what exactly will be done, be it offshore firm or a US-based one. Educate yourself on the task to an extent that you can, so you don't get surprised about results.

If you talk to SEO companies in the US, backlinks are the thing of the past to them (I dunno, they seem to matter) since page rank is one of many factors contributing to SERP as they focus on social media these days - Likes on Facebook and Twitter follows signal to search engines that your product/site is of quality.

Facebook is now running a promotion for Small Businesses and gives away Facebook credits for meeting some milestones - search for "Facebook Small Business Boost", great way to boost your likes on your product page.

Good Luck!

<p>Don't do it. Cheap SEO is most likely going to dig you into a massive hole you might never climb out of. <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/googles-over-seo-optmization-penalty/41517/" rel="nofollow">Recently Matt Cutts of Google has said</a> that Google are in the process of implementing an "over-seo" penalty which means if you over-seo your sites; extensive back-links, keyword and link spam, you could be wasting your time. He said the reason for such a change is to make it fair for sites with great content to have a shot at ranking well in comparison to sites that have a lot of back-links and SEO'd content but not really that high quality of content.</p>

<p>Now back to my original point of don't do it. Any SEO services you enlist off of Fiverr will most likely be damaging SEO tactics like back-link flooding, link spamming and other dodgy practices that could end up giving your site a worse rank than it originally had. There are some great SEO services out there but the good ones are expensive and definitely aren't advertising their services on Fiverr.</p>

<p>If you want some great advice on proper SEO, I would start ensuring that you write well-structured and meaningful content. This will mean when Google eventually implement this new penalty, your site could jump up the rankings organically.</p>

Fivrr is useful for indirect traffic: getting facebook 'likes' and Twitter followers, reposting a tweet. Using it for Black Hat SEO is risky.

I would say its better to read some SEO content. May be a books specific to SEO and then get along with any SEO company. I too was facing this problem but today I can see my site in various search engines and the results are really rocking. I made a list of all the local directories and forums where I can submit my site or may be publicize it too. This lead to a good page rank along with a nice keyword proximity.SEO is an art and just backlinks without any real content and better technique does not help. I too have done some consulting regarding SEO but will always suggest you not to go in these black hat SEO techniques as well as please dont be a prey to any scam.

Gonna take the other side for a change as I'm currently employed at one of the bigger companies in the adult industry who, ofcourse, does alot of SEO, and the thing we see alot when we try to get long tail traffic to our websites (which is the majority of traffic a small brand will recieve) is that the quality doesn't really matter, the people will come with spammy content, spammy backlinks, and we see that generally it's good.

a few pointers however:

1. malicious sites - even we as a site who specializes in adult content, try to steer away of malicious sites, as they are considered "bad neighbourhoods" and they'll damage your site reputation.

2. try getting backlinks at related sites - as you'll benefit alot from those, the people at fiverr - although I personally tried them for one of my website - aren't specializing in targeting related blogs and websites, and just spam everything.

3. try avoiding site-wide linkage, as it can cause trouble from what we've seen (when suddently you have 2 million links from one site when all of the other links are just a fraction of that - we saw that it causes damage)

4. remember that it's all about balance - if your brand is big enough - you have no control who links from where, and still google won't penalize you.

the bottom line is: it's cheap, test it a bit if it works for you, you can always shrug it off saying that you have no control over the backlinks - which is essentially is the truth.

Its impossible to offer a good service at prices as cheaply as that, not only is it not worth doing but could be harmful to your website, penalisations from google can last quite some time.

Google is judging things not just on backlinks etc but on the time spent on your site by a visitor and the quality of backlinks is more important than the quantity.

A site doesn't usually get backlinks "instantly" anyway.

Stay away from anyone that offers lots for little investment, its simply more harmful than helpful.

Fiverr is a great source for many things. I recently had a very simple VB program wrote for me and it has worked out great! 

I have not found one solution on Fiverr though that gives you a SEO solution. There are many tactics that you can combine to help your sites SEO, but ultimately it comes down to having original content on your site. 

I will tell you I have used Fiverr to help boost my sites. It is more of an art learning what jobs to execute when. This is something that I can give you more info on if you want.

1. Is it a good way to improve my SEO?

No it's not and it will hurt you in the long run if you keep doing it. Good SEO is an investment. You need to put in the time and resources to improve your site, do market research, provide content, maintain social media, maintain your blog, etc. It will give your ranking a quick boost but I assure you it won't last.

2. Is it safe to use this technique? I know Google like to ban sites that get a lot of backlinks instantly.

No it's not. And Google is getting smarter by the day. They'll see what you're up to and will pull the rug under you if you're not careful.

Before you buy that kind of offer you need to ask what quality of websites will be linking to yours. Quality means pagerank and content. If a low quality website links to you, that can harm you ranking on Google. Google now values social media interactions more than just a link. When you are building links, you need to take it easy, don't build 1000 links at once. In my early days of SEO, i did that on one of my websites and got penalized by Google. Backlinking is good, but not every backlink is a good one especially once promoted online. Also find out how the backlinks will be done (manually or automatically). Manual backlink is better than automatic backlink.
