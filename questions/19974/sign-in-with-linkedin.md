Is the Sign In with LinkedIn option worth it? Can we do it ourselves or do we need a developer?
Thanks in advance.

Its a jobsite that will get its initial users from LinkedIn Groups that I run/am part of..

Why are you asking us what YOUR users want?

You can't crowdsource in-house research, especially to the crowd who aren't your users.

If you already have a site that has your own email/password registration, then you should just stick with that.  Most users are hesitant to log in with credentials from other sites (particularly facebook), whereas almost everyone is fine with just using an email address to make an account.

Usually a site will use Linked In, Twitter, Facebook or Google login if

 - They don't want to take the time to implement login themselves or
 - They want some kind of specific user information out of that network, like a user's tweets

If you use Drupal, you can do it yourself with already-developed login modules:
http://drupal.org/project/linkedin

You'll still need to set up drupal though, but this might save you time.


Alternatively, you can use Wordpress and Janrain, both of which are easier to set up.

The two real solutions that i have looked at are http://www.janrain.com/ and http://www.gigya.com/ . 

The question of a developer or DIY - well just by the way you ask get a programmer - any programmer worth their salt would know how to do this as it needs to be integrated with your own login process.

best of luck
