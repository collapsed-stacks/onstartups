I'm a Web developper and have a dating website idea.  
I'll meet in the next few weeks some webmarketers that could be my potential partners.  
I'll talk about the idea of course and make them an interactive demo.

Should I make them sign a NDA knowing that the website is technically easy to setup ?

1. You can't make them sign anything, you can only ask.

2. They'll likely refuse.

3. If your concept is so simple to set up, an NDA will be worthless as someone can copy your idea the moment you launch.

4. Almost nobody has the time to steal an execute your idea.

5. Nobody can steal your vision and ability to execute.

Stop worrying and starting building. But only after you've talked to your customers to ensure you're building something they want and will use.
