What **position/title** in a company should I consider if:  

 1. I co-found an internet company, but my major is psychology and I'm
    not a geek.
 2. My contribution would be - providing money to launch and maintain the
   product
 3. I helped with the name and brand of the product.  

Can this cause any problem when dealing with new investors?

I would say that if your services to the startup don't exceed monetary contributions, your role is more of an investor than a co-founder. Your investment entitles you to a share in the equity of the company.

Call yourself a co-founder and do whatever work necessary to validate your business concept.  Worry about titles later.
