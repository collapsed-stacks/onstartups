My entire design is done, and now it's time to get it marked up. What is the best way to communicate with the developer which links lead to where, and certain processes etc. Should I just give them the wireframe? Ideally I'd like to use a service like psd2html, but I'm worried I'll lose quality that way because they are more "mass-produced." Any insight would be appreciated!

I am a designer and am finding that the most efficient is to hire front-end developers that understand design well enough to pay attention to each detail. 

The problem with comments and annotations is that they are painstaking and time-consuming. If the developer already knows to measure all spacing, type sizes, etc. then time is save on both sides. 

The problem is that good developers are also more expensive.

As someone who does design and development, I've been on both sides of the fence.  The single biggest takeaway I've found is always err on the side of more detailed notes so there's not change for mistake.

In Illustrator (concept is the same for Photoshop) I create a layer dedicated just to annotations, details such as widths, and other commentary.  These comments are always in bright red so that the developer won't miss them.  I get as detailed as font sizes, margin/padding/widths, etc.  Then, I export 1 copy with the annotations and 1 without.  This gives the developer a good sense of the overall "look and feel" while giving plenty of notes right where you need them.

send the wire frame and create the web page work flow and sitemap.
i used psd2html and they basically did a great job. search in google. 
there is also a company which use jpg2xhtml which the result is really impressive.

good luck
