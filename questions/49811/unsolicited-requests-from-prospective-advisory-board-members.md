Have many startups received unsolicited requests from people to serve as advisory board members?  Are those types of unsolicited requests usually accepted, as long as the person who wants to be an advisory board member has a relevant skill?

I'm trying to resume-build and get connected in an industry where I don't have a strong background.  However, I definitely have a skillset that small companies can use (think a CPA, tax planner, lawyer, etc.) and have extensive experience in helping a wide range of startups and small companies as part of my day job.

Before reaching out to some companies in the field, I wanted to see how others have reacted to unsolicited requests.  Thanks.

This question is going to be difficult to answer with any references or statistics, so you'll likely get a variety of opinions here.

If you were to contact one of the startups with which I've been involved, I would immediately assume the worst - that you are some sort of scam artist or thief.  The purpose of the advisory board is to have a group that is looking out for the best interests of the company.  A random stranger isn't going to bring much trust to the table, especially without a strong background in the industry (as you say).

Your best bet is going to be to get involved in the startup community in your area and network.  If you are highly skilled in contracts and finance, it won't take long for people to start asking for your help.  Those are typically expensive services for early-stage companies so they'll be hungry for free help.

Alternatively, find a mutual connection for these companies that you've already identified.  Having a third-party recommend you and your capabilities is worth far more than any cold call.
