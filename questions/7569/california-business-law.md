For the purposes of this questions, let's say I have a domain example.com. Eventually, I want to form Example LLC in California, where I live. However, at this point in time, I don't want to, because I'm not 18  and I'd prefer to do this on my own. Under California law, can I write a Terms of Service for my website (but where I don't sell anything) with Example instead of my name? The reason I ask this is because I understand you have to use your real name, establish an LLC/Corp, or file a DBA.

<p>A Terms of Service is a type of contract, and contracts can only bind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity%5F%28law%29" rel="nofollow">legal entities</a> (persons, natural or artificial (e.g. a corporation)). So you can't have a contract binding the visitor to something that doesn't exist.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.ahbbo.com/dbatmcom.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, a DBA wouldn't help you either, because under the same rules of capacity as above, a DBA doesn't have legal capacity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example:  Alfreda Smith conducts her
  florist business under the registered
  fictitious business name, "Blooming
  Right".  Florist Supplies, Inc. wants
  to enter into a contract with Blooming
  Right to supply Blooming Right's stock
  of tulips.  As Blooming Right is not a
  legal entity and only a DBA ("doing
  business as", another term for a
  fictitious business name), Blooming
  Right does not have legal capacity to
  enter into the supply contract with
  Florist Supplies, Inc..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As always, for an answer you can count on, you should seek legal advice from a lawyer (which this is, and I am, not). <strong>You may also</strong> want to drop a line to <a href="http://markbao.com/" rel="nofollow">Mark Bao</a>, and see if he'd be willing to tell you about his experiences setting up companies as a minor.</p>

<p>Yes, you "can" write Terms of Service. The issue, then, will be how many problems you are creating:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>By not having a separate legal entity, you will be taking on personal liability for this business venture - and you may not be able to discharge that personal liability even once the LLC is created. Please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/08/26/pre-formation-contracts-avoiding-personal-liability/" rel="nofollow">Pre-formation Contracts: Avoiding Personal Liability</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>As a minor, you generally can enter into contracts, and even have the right, subsequently, to reject them - please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2010/01/08/contracts-with-minors-can-lead-to-major-problems/" rel="nofollow">Contracts with Minors can Lead to Major Problems</a>. But by not letting users know that you are a minor, and further by hiding your existence behind the name of a non-existent company, you are committing fraud and, quite possibly, a variety of other civil and criminal violations.</p></li>
<li><p>Separately from the preceding considerations, the likelihood that you will do a good job of writing your own TOS is modest. Please see, for example, <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/05/06/terms-of-use-and-the-digital-millennium-copyright-act-dmca/" rel="nofollow">Terms of Use and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a>.</p></li>
