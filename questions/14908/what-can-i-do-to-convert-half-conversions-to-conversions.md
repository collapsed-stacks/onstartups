I'm running a [niche dating site][1] and I'm working on improving our conversion rate, which is not bad (about 15%), but can always go better. Our registration consists of :

1. user registration step 1 - user enters email and chooses password
2. user validates email
3. user fills in profile (2 pages of info)
4. profile complete = a conversion

I'm losing quite a few people on step 3 (about 40% of people who complete step 2 don't go on to complete their profile).

I'd really like some ideas what I can do to :
1 - I have the email addresses of people who stopped at step 2. What can i do to entice them to come back and complete their profile ?  I tried a competition (iPad competition, like everybody else :)) but that didn't work very well.

2 - What can I do to reduce the loss of people between steps 2 and 3.

I've attached images showing the pages of step 3

Three things that immediately spring to mind are:

* You're asking for a _lot_ of information. Do you _really_ need all of that information to register? Can you gather it incrementally post-registration?

* You're not giving any cues to the user how far along they are in the process. 

* Banner ads that take people away from your site are not something I'd be showing on a registration page...

My _guess_ is that the first issue - the amount of information - is the biggest problem. But some A/B testing should let you know for sure.

I agree with Adrian that the amount of info looks daunting. Also that the banner ads draw the eye much more than the actual registration.

The other thing that occurs to me is that people may give up on the unstructured questions (Profile headline and About yourself). If they don't know what to write and are not highly motivated, they could opt out here.

You could try:

 - having hints or instructions to help people decide what to write
 - have a pull down menu of generic statements that people can use and modify if they like
 - have an example of an effective headline and description to give people some inspiration.

I wouldn't ask for a profile right away. If someone wants to fill the profile you can provide a link to do it, which I'm sure you do anyway. Since your profile is a lot of selects you can show one select per page as the person browses around. You can even start to ask that *before* the user enters an email address and registers.
