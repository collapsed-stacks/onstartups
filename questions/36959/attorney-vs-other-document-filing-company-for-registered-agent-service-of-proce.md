I am trying to find a service of process representative (also known as a Registered Service Agent in states like DEL for example) for when I form my LLC in CA.  Is it better to go with an attorney's office to provide these services or just some random filing company?  There seem to be a lot of company's out there that primarily offer documentation/filing/notary based services - this is why I ask. 

How do I know if I have found a reputable/legitimate service process rep?

If your company is located in California, you can designate any of the officers (in fact, *any* willing person with a physical address in California) as a registered agent. There is no need to hire an unrelated third party.
