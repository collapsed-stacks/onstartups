We have a software product to be marketed to Enterprise Level commercial entities. We would like to build some Value Added Reseller and Distributor network with a low budget (unfortunately). What is the best efficient way?

I have been on the other end of this one, as a buyer. 

I would go to the major channel distributors first, such as VIP, Ingram, computer 2000 etc, and talk to their buyers, they may well want to demo it, and could very well help get the name out there on a next-to-no-budget deal.
