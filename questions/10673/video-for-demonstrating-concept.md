I want to create a 3 min video to show our concept and capabilities to our customers.
This video will involve some shots and after affects (some of our products are still
 concepts). What would be the best ( and cost affective) way to get this ?

<p><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp" rel="nofollow">Camtasia</a> has been a standard for screen capturing and video capturing for a long time.  I use it, and I love it.  It is very easy to use and learn.  </p>

<p>It costs $299, but you can download a free 30-day trial to check it out.</p>

<p>If you're on a mac. I'd recommend <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm" rel="nofollow">ScreenFlow</a>. It is really intuitive and great way to make a demo video. <a href="http://wistia.com" rel="nofollow">All of the demo videos</a> on our site are created with ScreenFlow.</p>
