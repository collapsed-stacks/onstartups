I'm working on a software app that I will sell online. I'm going to go with the "release-early, iterate quickly" plan, so rapid customer feedback is all-important.

I'm looking for a web app for my site that can handle any or most of the following: forums, feature suggestions, bug reporting, voting on features, release notes, mailing list.

I'm just starting off so I don't need something enterprise level - just something to get the momentum going.

<p><a href="http://uservoice.com" rel="nofollow">http://uservoice.com/</a> </p>

<p>is what you want. There is a free version that allows 100 voters and 1 forum. Once you need more then that you can upgrade accordingly. But this is great as a start.</p>

I'm not sure there's one tool for 100% of the above.  For example, there's UV and GS as suggested here but they're useless for release management.

Which is fine!  Just know that you'll have to piece together a few things.

FYI since others have avoided "releases," I suggest a blog -- easy to post updates and easy for your customers to subscribe via RSS or email as well as search an archive.

Same with a mailing list -- consider having that just be "your blog with comments."  If you want lots of discussion on the mailing list, use forums instead -- it does the same thing but Google will index it, etc..

<p>I'm in the same boat. Been looking at Uservoice for certain things and <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/" rel="nofollow">ZenDesk</a> for others. Will probably end up using a combination of the two.</p>

<p>Google Analytics to see which pages are getting hit. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.kissmetrics.com/" rel="nofollow">Kiss Metrics</a> to be able to easily ask users what they want. </p>

<p>Uservoice.com is good for Q&amp;A forums. It'll save you a bundle in support costs. </p>

<p>Use a wiki for registered users. It will provide them a way to capture knowledge which your product or documentation didn't make easy or obvious. </p>
