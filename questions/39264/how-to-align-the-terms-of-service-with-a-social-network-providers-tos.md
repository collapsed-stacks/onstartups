Hello we're trying to afford the Terms-of-Service compilation on our own taking as the base the wonderful Wordpress TOS: http://en.wordpress.com/tos/

In a great part it is absolutely OK for us. But the important point that miss this TOS, or I misread it, the description of the communication between the Website and Social Network Providers like G+, FB, Twitter etc.

Any advise on how to introduce it in the subsequent TOS will be very appreciated!
