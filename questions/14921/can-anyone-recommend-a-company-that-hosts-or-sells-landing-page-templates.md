I am looking to do some A/B tests using landing pages but I am not a designer. 

Do you know of a company that sells or offers hosted landing pages at a reasonable price? 

I have looked at http://unbounce.com/ but I would like to get some recommendations from people who have used their services or the service/product of any other company providing landing page templates.

<p>You may already be aware of this, but Unbounce has a free plan you can sign up for. The free plan is <strong>very</strong> limited and most likely won't work for you, but at least you can sign up for it and play around with the templates to see for yourself if it's what you are looking for.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://unbounce.com/pricing/" rel="nofollow">Unbounce pricing page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can also sign up for a Free account (without a credit card) which has a 200 Unique Visitor traffic limit, 1 Custom Domain and will include an Unbounce branded footer on your published page. This can be removed by upgrading to any paid plan or by choosing our $10/month unbranded option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The free Unbounce plan signup is <a href="https://app.unbounce.com/signup/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The other large player in that segment is <a href="http://www.performable.com/" rel="nofollow">Performable</a>. I'm playing around with their system now, and it seems pretty good. Performable also offers personal getting started support / introductions to their platform.</p>

<p>I don't know what you'll consider a "reasonable price". Here is <a href="http://www.performable.com/plans/" rel="nofollow">Performable's pricing</a>, starting at 99 USD.</p>
