<p>This is a medium sized company based in the US. We have sales employees all over the county and Canada, China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Brazil, Europe, Middle East, and India.  Currently one of our sales representatives for China lives in the US but spends most of his time in China. He has US health insurance but there is much hastle for him to obtain services while he is in China, which is most of the time. Is there an option to obtain international health insurance?</p>
