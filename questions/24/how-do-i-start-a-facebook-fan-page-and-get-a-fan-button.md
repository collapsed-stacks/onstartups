<p>Here is a detailed walkthrough: (i tried to make it as clear as possible)</p>

<p>Create a facebook page here <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php</a> , select a category, page name and sign your name.</p>

<p>Now your page is created and you are taken to the page dashboard. There is a link on the left that says Add Fan Box to your site. Click it or you can follow this link <a href="http://www.facebook.com/facebook-widgets/fanbox.php" rel="nofollow">www.facebook.com/facebook-widgets/fanbox.php</a> . Select the page you want to create a fan button for. If you don't want the page stream or fans displayed on your site uncheck the corresponding options. Click on the big other button to get the embeddable code to place in your site.</p>

<p>To fill out the rest of your page's info, click your way back to the page dashboard, or you can follow this link <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/manage/" rel="nofollow">www.facebook.com/pages/manage/</a> and click on your page name. 
Then click the info tab, and then the Edit Information link underneath it.</p>

Can't you just create a link from your site directly to your fanpage?  Or, you can use one of the standard "facebook" logos floating around in place of the link, but it would do the same thing.
