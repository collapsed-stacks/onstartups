I and my team members have a handful of outstanding issues we would like to track, ranging from technical to business-oriented. We are looking for a free/low-cost issue tracker, perhaps with CRM.

Data portability (i.e. that I can export all my issues in a relatively standard format) is important to me.

Something integrated with a wiki (again with data portability) is a plus.

[Atlassian JIRA][1] is a recognised issue tracker. Atlassian does a $10 license for 10 users, depending on the size of your startup obviously, this could be a good fit. There are also other products that Atlassian sells for $10.

By the way JIRA integrates pretty well with Confluence which is a wiki that most probably would answer your CRM needs. There is a $10 license for Confluence as well.


**Disclaimer** I work for Atlassian.

If you're familiar with RoR platform â€” I can recommend setting up Redmine+FatFreeCRM. Both of them are free, but as almost any open-source product they will need some time to set them up according to your specific needs.

<p>If it's not too expensive for you, <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/" rel="nofollow">FogBugz</a> can be downloaded and installed on your server for $999 for 5 users or less.</p>

<p>That may be much cheaper in the long run than a plan that charges per user per month.</p>

<p>I'm also playing with <a href="http://www.redmine.org" rel="nofollow">Redmine</a> recently and, for now, it definitely looks great. It seems that community is pretty active and there are quite few plugins available.</p>

<p>It's true that setting it up could be a nightmare, though, but you don't actually need to know much about RoR itself to install it. It doesn't hurt to try to follow instructions - you might succeed in a first attempt. :)</p>

<p>For customer support, we've been very happy using <a href="http://tenderapp.com" rel="nofollow">Tender</a>. And for issues/bugs we use <a href="http://unfuddle.com/" rel="nofollow">Unfuddle</a>.  Sifter and lighthouse look like great bug trackers as well. Lighthouse integrates with Tender.  Github has issues/tasks built in too, if you're hosting code over there, which isn't a terrible idea :) </p>

We just launched a hosted help desk software application, it also has lots of contact management features. I don't know if it would be an exact fit for you, but you can try it free for a month. After that, it's $8 a month per user, pretty much the lowest cost available above open source.

<p>There are a lot of free bug tracking &amp; wiki tools out there.  For instance, <a href="http://www.projectlocker.com" rel="nofollow">ProjectLocker</a> does bug tracking with the open-source Trac tool.  Downloads of your database can be imported into anyone's Trac installation, including yours if you choose to self-host.  Pricing starts at free for teams up to 5.  </p>

Do also consider the cost of your time as well as just the raw cost of the product. We are big fans of Fogbugz because it saves us a huge amount to time on organisation and handling customers and forums - time better spent on developing our product.
