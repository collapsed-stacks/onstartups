I am starting a small retail shop for computer sales, accessories, peripherals, service and support etc.  Picture a small Best Buy if you will.  I have a solid initial inventory list and a 20,000 budget to get started with purchasing that inventory (even if only one of each item to stock the shop.)  I have already worked out the entire inventory cost using Amazon.com prices so please don't tell me that it cannot be done. 

Can anybody recommend a solid wholesaler that has a good track record of getting smaller retailers started (good prices, knowledgeable sales team)?  What about companies like PCMall, TigerDirect, or Compnation.  

My purchase timeframe is 1-2 months.  I appreciate any support the community can offer.

Thanks!

Until you have a large enough sales volume to get quantity discounts, your best bet may be to make purchases from online sites. If you shop online and find the best prices, you should be able to mark things up enough for retail sales. Large online stores may only have a 5-10% margin, so you would not be losing too much by going that route. You can provide some in-store service to add value to your products.
