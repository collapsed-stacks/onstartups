I have received a great offer for the domain name techhotbed.com and techhotbed.net (all of which I own under a company name). A very powerful blog building company approaches me last week and made a great offer. I turned it down at first just to gauge how serious they were. They came back with their business lawyer and have an offer letter drawn and sent to me in an official US Post office mail. This made me pause and thought long and hard about it. Now I am all confused. We are using the domain name to build a very competitive IT career site and think that we can disrupt the biggest and best IT Career sites out there. But It will take time and money. Is now the time to take the money and Run? Please advise.

I took a look at your web site. You have chosen an unbelievably competitive market, where your competition can afford to run TV ads during the Super Bowl. Your chance of success is vanishingly small.

So ask yourself, how much in sales did you make in the last quarter? And how much in the quarter before that? Is the sales number at least doubling every quarter? *(Yes, doubling- you are just starting and that should be an easy target.)*  Figure your sales keep doubling every quarter for a year. Then figure your **profit** for that year. 

Is their offer for the domain name **more** than you will make in a year? Is it a lot more? Then go for it. You haven't invested much of anything in marketing and promoting your name, so a switch will be easy. Find another domain name.

Also note that you can probably get more money than they offered by negotiating with them. And remember that you are probably **not** the only domain name they are after. If they don't come to terms with you, they will find someone else. So act promptly.

In my opinion, it looks like a pretty generic domain.  From what I can tell, it doesn't look like you're going to disrupt much just by owning the domain name (but I don't know the full story).  If you want to disrupt, do so by making a great competing service.

Take the money.  :)

You mentioned in another thread you have a more lucrative venture to spend your time on. So I'd sell the domain and use the proceeds from the sale on your other project. As the others have said here, the market in this area is extremely competitive. The video aspect you have is a little unique, but easily replicated by larger, more established competitors like monster, payscale, manta, jigsaw and even the relatively fresh glassdoor. There was another user on here who created something similar months ago as well. They all have what you have plus a lot more.

Are you sure they want to buy your domain name because of your site content or because they branded something else with the same name and want to claim it? If you can find out why they want to buy your domain at the price offered, you may be able to posture yourself with a sweeter deal.
