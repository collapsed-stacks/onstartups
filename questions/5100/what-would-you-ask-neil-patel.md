One of my all time favorite blogger / entrepreneur, Neil Patel, has agreed to let me interview him.   I have a rough list of questions I will ask him but I would like to get a subjective view from the OnStartups community.

**My proposed questions:**

 1. How long have you known you
    wanted to be an entrepreneur and
    where did the inspiration come from?

 2. So far in your professional career
    what has been the most rewarding
    experience and why?

 3. What should a startup focus on in
    the beginning stages?

 4. What has been your biggest mistake
    that could have easily been avoided?

 5. Where do you see internet technology
    in 5 years?

1. Who is your role model and why?
2. What was the first job position you ever held?
3. In your opinion, what is the single most important key to being successful in life?


I like to find out from successful people what their beginnings were like.  Its very inspirational to hear of an average person from humble beginnings climb the ladder of success.
