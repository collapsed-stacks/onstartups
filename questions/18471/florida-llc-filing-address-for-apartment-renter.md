I live in an apartment in Florida and I have a PO Box. My lease contract prevents me from registering a business as the physical address.

**I was going to use my PO Box but the registration form says that I must provide a _street address_ for the "Principal Place of Business" section of the form. This is preventing me from moving forward with the registration process. This is purely an on-line, programming business. Is there some loophole or trick I'm not getting here?**

_Electronic registration of Florida LLC form is located here: <https://efile.sunbiz.org/llc_file.html> You need to Accept terms and click Add Filing & Pay Fee then go to Principle Place of Business_

Do you have a friend who has an address you can use temporarily until you transition to an establishment with a street address? Otherwise, you can bank on a registered agent to provide a street address for you (google: florida registered agent).
