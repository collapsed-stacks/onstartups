There was a ton of great IC information here (http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/511/hiring-sales-people-as-independant-contractors)

HOWEVER, no mention of allowing the IC to use a company email address for communicating with clients about specific contract work. This is a true IC relationship, they do graphic design work for others. We're using them to cover our overflow design work. They work from home, set their own hours, use their own equipment and software, and are only required to deliver a quality final product.

This said, should I feel comfortable creating a company email account for the IC so that they can communicate with our client back and forth regarding the project's details.

n most companies I worked for as consultant I got an in company address. Mosst ly because it is not ONLY an adress (but also allowss access to address book, scheduling and all the other exchange goodies). Often the email address was markeed as external (like "John Doe (extern)") to communicate to all recipients I was not part of the core staff.

This includes major companies, among them Microsoft, so it seems to be an established process. At the end, it is quite hard to tie into an integrated infrastructure (exchange, sharepoint etc.) if you dont have an account.

Generally it's a bad idea to give non-employees email addresses - certainly you would need to have a strict usage policy agreed. What you describe is about the only case where it should be considered: where independent contractors are in effect acting as the company's agents.

One alternative I've seen is to give the client a *project-specific* company email address with which to communicate with "their" project team. Anybody who is working on the project can then use this shared email address for outgoing client communications. 

Incoming client communications can be place in a shared mailbox. (Beware of forwarding: you don't want the client receiving bounces and delayed delivery messages from the contractor's email addresses.)

I think it is a good idea. The client sees you as a cohesive unit; otherwise, they could just manage a bunch of contractors on their own. 

If they are working for your clients there is an established level of trust and you should include email policies in any type of contract. You should also let them know that you will archive the email. Contractors come and go, but if the client has questions or wants to hire you for another project, you want to have the history of what went on during the last project. 

It sounds like "Big Brother" but the contractor needs to know they are dealing with your clients and you have a right to know what is going on. It also saves the trouble of having copy everyone on everything.

If the IC is outward facing for your company,communicating with your customers, you absolutely have to give them an address.  You should also have a corporate email policy and give them a copy so there is no confusion that all e-mail originating from the account or sent to the account is property of your company.  Additionally, if you are very concerned about the e-mail content you can set up a shadow account that receives copies of all email sent to and from that account.

Whenever I go on a mission, I am assigned an email based on the compnay's convention followed by the suffix "-ext" that means external person.
ex: jsmith-ext@company.com

This is a must have to be able to let the coworkers email him.
In addition to that, most companies do not allow access to external emails such has webmails and foreign companies email system.
So giving the contractor an internal email is crucial for workflow
