As part of making a business case I'm trying to gather data for Android phone sales (quantity and dollar value) by continent. I was initially hoping this would be something that Google could provide but I've had trouble so far.

Can anyone point me in the right direction? I would be willing to purchase the data if necessary, I just don't know who's go it.

Industry analysts like Gartner create reports like this one - http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1764714 - which may have some of the information you're looking for. The full reports can be extremely expensive, but you may be able to find what you need by searching through different press releases, or contacting them to see if you can purchase a more specific set of data for a lower price.
