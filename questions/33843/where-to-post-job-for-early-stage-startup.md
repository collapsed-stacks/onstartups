We are bootstrapping and offering equity. We're seeking a front end developer.

We posted on startuply.com but are looking for other places. We used one location on craigslist. Anywhere else we should list our job opening?

<p>It depends on whether you're looking for a co-founder or an employee. Offering equity instead of a salary may make it a bit trickier to post your job on traditional job sites, but here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/ask" rel="nofollow">Ask Hacker News</a></li>
<li><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn Jobs</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Other things to consider are:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a blog, post an announcement on your blog.</li>
<li>Ask on social media sites: Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn. If you published a blog post on your job offer, share a link to it as well.</li>
<li>Ask your current network for referrals.</li>
<li>Go to local meetups to meet new people.</li>
</ul>
