We have a website and some mobile apps which generate significant number of daily views (say 10M). 
The main feature of these projects is that, in most cases, you know a lot about users interests, hobbies and demographic data.

Now we would like to add advertising to get some revenue. 

Which considerations should we bear in mind to implement it?
Do you know existing solutions that could be used out of the box? 

Assuming that you want to use the data you have about users and serve them ads that best match their profiles.

There two main options depending what platforms the mobile app is on and if you want to use one company or are happy to spread it.


iAds http://advertising.apple.com/
Google mobile ads http://www.google.com/ads/mobile/

Both of the solutions utilise details about the apps they apear on and the users of the hand set.

If you already advertise with google ad words then google may just me easier. however if your apps only apear on iOS then you can get more per click from the iAd.
