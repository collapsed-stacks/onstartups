What do people use to monitor the web for "calls for proposals/business opportunities" in certain sectors?

I assuming carefully crafted Google Alerts and good old fashioned networking? Are there any other tools available?

If you're selling into government, then monitor their websites. A good one in the Canadian space is Merx: http://www.merx.com/. I've also seen a lot of RFP's posted to http://www.charityvillage.com and we used to get leads from http://www.vendorseek.com/ as well.
