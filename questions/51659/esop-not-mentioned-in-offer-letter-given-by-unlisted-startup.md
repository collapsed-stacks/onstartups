<p>I have an offer from a startup. The Employer verbally mentioned that when the company goes into listing ESOP(Employee Stock Options) will be provided to me but it is not written in the offer letter.</p>

<p>My doubts are: </p>

<p>1) Can a startup(in India) which is unlisted can promise ESOP in writing?</p>

<p>2) Should I ask my Employer to include the promised thing in offer letter?</p>
