I'm looking to start a new website. The website is going to have a subscription for a specific price. The problems I am running into is where to start first I have already started drawing the site out on paper. I just am at a loss when it comes to whats first.. Do I need a DBA for this? How do I go about copy righting my idea and do I need a lawyer. I am also having trouble finding a program that will create my website i need to be able to have people sign up 1 free membership and one paid. **ANY AND ALL ADVICE WILL BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL ** 

Thank you for the advice.

without completely writing out your model on here to help us answer your question better what would the website be doing, providing a service like an application, a product that would be sent to the customer on a subscription basis?

As a general rule, creating a website can be really easy or very complex. It is totally dependant on what functionality you want to build. In order for you to create a website that is more advanced than a simple website you would need a developer. Simple website to my knowledge don't really provide subscription level services, I think there may be some plugin's out there on wordpress but don't hold me accountable for that. Depending on the project a (good) developer may be able to manage the whole project themselves and be able make decisions on what best language to code the website in and all the other technical things you may find difficulty executing yourself. Just to add the term functionality refers what the user will be getting for their subscription etc.

Well done on creating your first wireframes, this will help the developer in creating your site. It is wise to look into similar websites in your space to see what they're doing and how they are executing their design & model.

The protection of your idea can be very complex. Most of the time for websites, the technology (code) you produce can have intellectual property attached to it. Most of the time for your situation you could get trademark on a specific service you provide. Although I am not a lawyer that is my best judgement so I suggest to always ask a lawyer once you have started investing in development of your brand & web product.

Your comment 'I am also having trouble finding a program that will create my website' concerns me that you should really do your homework on how you want this product to be created. My best advice is to contact a digital agency if you have the funds, they can actually help you build your whole business from brand design right through to web development. They are usually very expensive but if you have the funds that could be the best route to market.

Second to this, contact a developer via peopleperhour, whitetruffle or similar sites

Best of luck mate!
