I am currently developing a website that will be selling low-priced digital goods (user-generated travel itineraries) - most will be priced between $0.99-$2.99. I've been searching for an eCommerce solution with reasonable costs, but vendors like Paypal, Google, Avangate, Plimus -- all charge too much when a transaction is only $0.99. Do you have any recommendations on finding a reasonably priced vendor?

Thanks very much,
Jason

<p>Have you considered a <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/buy-stock-credits-pay-as-you-go.php?&amp;utm_source=email161009&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Buy&amp;utm_campaign=MissYou" rel="nofollow">credit approach</a> like istockphoto? You purchase a bank of credits (say 12 for $18.00) and then people can purchase items for 1 credit, 3 credits, etc. </p>

<p>Sounds as if your business is a repeat one, so people may not mind keeping a balance.</p>
