I hopo you can give me a little advice I created a llc company in DE couple years ago, I never use it (is a parachute company if I lost my job), I'm being paying federal and state taxes, but I did not renew the state license the last 3 years in a row (I moved and I did not change the business address, and because of that I did not receive the license renewal forms. (I know silly and dumb) , does it carry any legal trouble?, it is easier to forget about the company or close it?, I'm concern about expenses since I am temporally little short of cash

I'm not an attorney so seek advice prior to acting, but if you didn't conduct business under this LLC and let the renewel for the tax id lapse it probably fine to close it down.  You could also open it back up.  In MN renewing after going past the deadline costs a bit but is cheaper then creating a new LLC.  As long as your business name didn't get taken by someone else which maybe possible you shouldn't experience any difficulties reinstating at a later date.

So the only legal issue of having a business that you didn't renew occurs if you tried to conduct business under that entity, because the entity is no longer valid for that state.

<p>There is another legal issue.  A lawyer I know told me the first thing he does when trying to "pierce the corporate shield" is to check whether the company/llc has kept up with its legal filings with the secretary of states.</p>
