I was wondering if anyone was familiar with mobile app return policies and how they affect cash flow. When Apple/Google sends a monthly check for an app, does that already discount returns and chargebacks? Would I potentially need to hold a reserve?

(Also, if I take CC myself, would I typically use a reserve to account for returns?)

For the Apple App Store at least:

> How can I identify refunds? Why there are refunds on my reports? What

> “All Sales are ﬁnal”. We will provide a refund if in our opinion the

> indication of quality issues with your apps that may be resolved by
> issuing a software update.

For Android there are some guidelines here: http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html

Digging through that, I think the policy is 48 hour returns, but I'm not completely confident in said answer.
