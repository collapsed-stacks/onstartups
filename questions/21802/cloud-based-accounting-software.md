I am in the process of starting a business.  The nature of the business is Photography (weddings, etc.).  What would be a good accounting software solution (preferably cloud-based or SaaS)?

The big dog in online accounting software is QuickBooks.com. If you want to try something new (and maybe easier to use), give one of these guys a shot:

Outright.com or 
Zero.com

If you just need invoicing, freshbooks.com is a good choice.

Good luck with your business!

For a simple interface, take a look at Wave Accounting (http://waveaccounting.com). (Full disclosure: that’s where I work). Wave is  a 100% free, online accounting app for freelancers and small businesses.

And since you're in the field of photography, June is actually Photographer’s Month at Wave!

We’re pulling together financial/tax/business info, etc. with a photographer focus. We're looking for input, so if you're interested, please take our 3 min survey: http://waveaccounting.com/photographers.
