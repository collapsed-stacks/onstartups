<p><strong>You don't need to look for the websites...</strong>  To target display ads to a certain geography you use 'location targeting' within Adwords.</p>

<p>Even if you did find a website that did display image ads in your area, that knowledge isn't going to get you anywhere.  The website owner isn't going to be able to display just your ads via Adsense.  That isn't how it works.  </p>

<p>Take a good look through the Adwords help pages - they are very thorough.  e.g. <a href="https://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=164891" rel="nofollow">Location Targeting</a></p>

As I saw, If you search for the javascript you will find all sites which use Google AdSense, but there is no difference in the code for the sites which only display image ads. 

However, I could be mistaken, but I just compared the Code for AdSense displaying Image Ads or Text Ads, and it seems to be the same.

You may need to narrow down your search to specific keywords and your local area. Then I guess there is no other way as to visit each of the sites to see if they display image ads.

Good Luck.
