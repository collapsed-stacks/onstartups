I own a start up, and me and my staff are adding some slogans onto our twitter graphics (background). 
We we're thinking of adding my name.surname@xxxxx.com instead of generic info@ or contact@ ....
I think it's better to have a more personal touch...am I wrong?
To put a name behind the brand.

If you put your name on an email, you can always have a team manage it, but people might look at it and think that the company is too small to handle their needs.  If you are providing a service, you don't want people to think that one person either has to do all the work, or is running the show.  Typically, these emails are setup to allow several users to manage a queue of information.  If you want a more personal touch, don't respond from the sales@ or customers@ emails, instead let people reply with their personal email address.

The other think you should think of by putting your name as the email is that you then put your name in the public domain.  This is fine, as long as you have no public records that you don't want tied to the company.  If you have a personal Facebook page, Twitter account, etc, you might not want people to simply Google your name and find out about you personally (not this easily anyway).  Keep in mind that public records (marriages, divorces, real estate, etc) are often available via online searches.

Finally, you don't want to have to change email addresses all of the time.  What happens if you decide to sell the company?  All of the customers are pointed to an email address tied to a person that is no longer with the company.  This can make for several odd (to say the least) internal and external politics.

Hope this helps, ultimately the right answer is the one you decide is best for your company.  I get that people are trying to add a personal touch, but I think it's started to get creepy.  I shouldn't have to provide my name to Starbucks every time I want a drink, and I certainly don't expect stores to need my phone number or email.  At the end of the day, it's a fine line between personal touch and respecting privacy boundaries. (caveat: all IMHO)

We use one email address for all public communications. And with Google Apps, it is essentially a gmail with our domain on it. I have my own personal address, but never ever tell people that matter to email it... my team watches the shared inbox and ensures I answer important emails.

Putting your name as id , is good, but you have to maintain the emails which will come to that email, and you always need to keep track of all the information coming over that, being professional is good, but do a research of what idea you want,some websites like that and all.
