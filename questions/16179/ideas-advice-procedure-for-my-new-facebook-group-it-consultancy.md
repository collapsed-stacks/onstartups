I am planning to start a consultancy using facebook fan/group/profile page. 
Could anyone shower some ideas about what all I can achieve. Some tips about this to make huge success? And the procedures that I need to follow to keep this as legal?

While I definitely appreciate your business goals with the site, I have a little experience with FB, so I can add a little info for you.  First, I would note that they're billing practices are interesting, if not creative.  If you choose to run some ads on FB, be very wary of the dates and terms, even going so far as to take screenshots to verify what you've entered.  There is no formal procedure in place to dispute a bill - they will simply ignore you.  That being said, FB is definitely the place for up and coming marketing campaigns, so I think your idea is fresh and exciting.  There are a few good books on the subject which offer lots of practical advice on functionality and customization, so I'd suggest going to your local book store and spending some time paging through them to see if any of them can be very useful for you.  There are many different ways to customize FB pages.  While I'm not aware of any actual legal ramifications for building a consultancy around FB pages, I believe you should tag this as legal, to get the opinion of an actual attorney.  Numerous PR/marketing/Ad companies are adding this option as a part of their offering to their clients, so I'd suggest figuring out who your competition is and honing your craft until you're better than them.  Analyze their followers, and if you decide to do advertising on FB, target a similar demographic, or whichever specific demographic you're marketing to.
