My partner and I, after many years of researching and inventing, became patent agents and formed an LLC.  Our business model is based on start-ups that need patents and trademarks but can't afford the high prices of law firms.  We are also offering Accelerated Examination processes that guarantee a response from the USPTO in a year (generally get the patent allowed in 12 months).  Do you, as a group, think this is a good business model and do you think there are start-ups and small cos. that can utilize our services?

<p>As you already know - patents are a charged topic.  Some believe patents to be the bane of innovation, others believe that locking IP makes them more fundable. </p>

<p>I believe there is a need for what you offer. </p>

<p>Taking a page from <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/youre-a-little-company-now-act-like-one.html" rel="nofollow">Jason's blog</a> - you're a small company, you should try to look different than other legal firms.  Unfortunately, I don't get that from your site - nor do I get the feel that your company is targeting the needs of startups. ( Not trying to be rude here, just trying to give honest feedback. ) </p>

<p>It would be nice if your site had content to help SME's understand what it means to protect their IP, what the process is, what exposures they may have, and (most importantly) how you can assist them meet their objectives in a cost effective manner. </p>

<p>Perhaps engaging with a content writer would help out here.</p>

Looks like you are doing a market research... 

While this site is open for all startups, it mostly attracts software-related startups. Patents is not something that small software companies care about. It is generally hard to patent stuff in software, and it's even harder to defend them later. No small cost legal firm can change that. Trademarks is a different thing, but last I checked they were easy to handle without a law firm at all.
