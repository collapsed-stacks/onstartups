Is [Micropreneur Academy][1] worth it? Any members on this site? Also, what does it cost?

Background:
I read the 'Software by Rob' blog and think he has some very good advice for the whole micro-ISV space.  He started this membership site and I haven't heard anything about it besides from his blog.

My other [question about startuptodo.com][2] got me some informative answers, so I thought I would ask about another membership site.

<p>The Micropreneur Academy is definitely worth it. When I joined I was a few (maybe 6) months into development but only about 25% of the way complete with the code. Afterwards I realized I was in for a rough time if I didn't change my strategy. I changed what I was doing and hit beta in about 4 months. Then I acquired my main competitor (with Rob Walling's help), and had a very successful launch where I converted a very high number of visitors. Now I'm about a month into my product release. </p>

<p>A couple of months ago I blogged a review about it:
<a href="http://www.bidsketch.com/reviews/the-micropreneur-academy/">http://www.bidsketch.com/reviews/the-micropreneur-academy/</a></p>

<p>I recommend them even more now that I've launched. I'm 100% positive that my launch wouldn't have been anywhere as successful as it was if it wasn't for their help. </p>

<p>So yeah, when I say it's worth it, it's really an understatement :)</p>

<p>I'm a member of the <a href="http://micropreneur.com" rel="nofollow">Micropreneur Academy</a> and have been for several months.  When you join, you get access to a series of lessons about understanding everything there is to know about a startup--converting to a "micropreneur" (one-person entrepreneur), finding the right product (buy or build), creating a sales website, generating traffic, SEO site optimization, launching, and general business background (accounting, legal, structure, etc).  Not just stuff like "Hey, you need a sales website to be successful!".  This is a step-by-step guide on what to do, where to get the right tools to do it, and the pitfalls to avoid.  There's a vast treasure trove of information there and I'd say it's well worth the money.  Discussions about ventures are held on a private forum and lots of great information is shared there...</p>

<p>Rob's site has a few of the broader topics covered by the Academy, but there's much greater depth inside than on Rob's blog.  If you like the content you've found on Rob's blog, I'd most definitely recommend the Academy.</p>

<p>I pay $47 per month but to be honest, I'd pay double that for the valuable information I get each month.</p>

I think Rob's Micropreneur Academy is totally worth it - Rob is creating an MBA-like program for microISVs. The content is first rate (ahem, I wrote the blogging and Twitter modules), the forums are robust and he's got a 1/2 price sale on today (Nov. 17, 2009).

("But Bob, isn't your startup http://startuptodo.com a competitor to Micropreneur Academy? Shouldn't you be telling people it's terrible, horrible, don't spend your money there and he hurts kittens?" [a Business of Software Conference inside joke.])

Hell no! 

First off, if you're not prepared to spend a few dollars at **both** our services, you should reconsider doing a startup. Second, Rob focuses on the context you need to build your microISV. I focus on saving you big globs of time while building it. Answers.OnStartups.com can help you with very specific questions. You should be spending time, attention and money at all three.

Bottom line, the Micropreneur Academy is definitely worth joining... and while you have your credit card out, come check out StartupToDo.com.

<p>Thanks for asking the question, I imagine others are curious about this as well.</p>

<p>Since I'm biased in favor of the Academy I'm not going to answer directly lest I sound like a shill for my own product, but I did want you to know that Mike (my business partner) and I are out here listening and available to answer any questions you have about the Academy or about launching a MicroISV/bootstrapped startup.</p>

<p>To see real products that have been launched by Academy members check out the <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/micropreneur-academy-product-showcase/" rel="nofollow">product showcase</a>.</p>

<p>And to see our press mentions visit the <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/press/" rel="nofollow">press page</a>.</p>

<p>To contact me directly with any questions you can do so through my blog, Software by Rob.com.</p>

It's a bit offtopic, but while the website may be interesting, the presentation totally puts me off. The landing page just offers a free report and no real explanation of the product and I've come to associate these kind of pages with scams... By contrast StartupToDo has a great landing page, it clearly explains what it is, why I would want to join and the price.

Now, the information about the academy is inside the pdf report and that might be done to limit the number of people coming in at first. But still, if I hadn't read about it here, I would have left that website in less than a minute.

What I like about the Micropreneur Academy is the focus: tiny startups focusing on bootstrapping their way into the wider world.  It is undeniable that there is a wealth of very high quality information on the web, especially here at onstartups.com. 

***The hard part of research and educational material is paring down that wealth of knowledge into focused, actionable advice targeted on your goal.***  What Rob and Mike provide at the Academy is the experience to provide that focused advice to a software techie like me.  From that education, I now have a framework to hang other advice on, as well as a non-public community of like minded people to bandy ideas with.  My Academy membership is easily the best value I've received in education, and the knowledge keeps paying me dividends each time I use it.

Yes! It's definitely worth it, I would say it's a bargain.

I have been a member since June 09, and have found the content to be invaluable. Rob provides modules in PDF format and as MP3s, and there are plenty of video demonstrations -- which I find especially helpful. The content is very focused and well written; my only regret is that it wasn't available when I started my company.

You also have the opportunity to share ideas and get feedback on your ideas from other successful entrepreneurs. 

I'm fairly certain there is a money back guarantee, so you've got nothing to lose.

I did the trial and must say it's not really worth it. It's mainly a rehash of the well known mISV books out there mixed with some Adwords stuff.

I'd say do the trial and see for yourself if it's worth to you.

The micropreneur academy is a valuable resource for anyone in the micropreneur/startup/micro-isv business.  Being veterans of the software entrepreneurship Rob & Mike have a wealth of knowledge.  In the micropreneur academy Rob & Mike their shares their wealth of knowledge in **extreme detail**.  

In my opinion the real value of the academy lies in the detailed explanation provided on every aspect of building and marketing software products.  The lessons cover everything from finding the right product to build to actually launching your product and beyond.  I have been through around 70% of the lesson in the academy and have learnt something valuable in each lesson.

I am a current member of the academy and highly recommend it to everyone.

I joined the Academy a few months back, but stopped going for various reasons.  I wish to join back again, but do not want to spend the money right now.  I found the tasks to be useful.  I didn't participate in the forums or online meetings.  One thing they never help me with is finding the product that will maintain my interest for months on end.
