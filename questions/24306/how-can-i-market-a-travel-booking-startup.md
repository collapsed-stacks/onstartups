I am launching a travel startup for flight, bus, hotel, car and bicycle bookings. I am focusing on the consumer market. A key marketing point is that a small amount of each flight ticket is donated to NDTV Green Earth. I'm planning a campaign around this promotion. What online and offline marketing methods should I consider?

First you need to outline what competitive advantages you have. Can you give better deals, more options, better service, etc?

Your competition is well funded and has been advertising on a broad base for a long time. You need to be able to first offer something they can't, preferably to an easy to reach niche community.

Without knowing your strengths it is pointless you attempt to guide. If you don't have defined strengths against your competition, that is the first guiding step you need to take. Understand what you are going up against, and where customers decision points are, so you can sway customers away from the advertising of your competitors.

You need to have a better product than competitive sites.  If you do not, your marketing efforts will not result in much.

If you do have competitive product, focus on

- SEO
- SEM
- Social (since travelling is social and lands itself well to that medium)
- Can experiment with event promotion/organization
- Feature some of the most amazing travels
