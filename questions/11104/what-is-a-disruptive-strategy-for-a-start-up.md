Can anyone explain to me what a disruptive strategy is for a start up company in software.

Apparently launching a disruptive strategy gives a start up a higher chance of success according to Thomas Thurston a start up predictor

<p>While it may be true that launching a disruptive strategy may give a startup a higher chance of success, pursuing said strategy just because it's disruptive (especially if it has no other merits) may disappoint you. </p>

<p>Searching for a product/idea that's disruptive instead of working on more down-to-earth concepts which have a likelier success rate may disappoint you too!</p>

<p>The term "disruptive" has been abused over the past couple of years, to the point that it sometimes means nothing. Our own <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/users/2/jason" rel="nofollow">Jason</a> (one of the hosts of this site, btw) wrote two funny and insightful posts on the topic very recently, and you can read them <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/not-disruptive.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/authentic-dead.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
