This is marketing question but don't know where to ask it.

My possible client is relying in traditional manual accounting system. I want to convince him to use acomputerised accounting system.

As an IT consultant how can I convince him?

I am trying to sell my own accounting package.

Do you know anything about accounting? Have you ever had to do it manually? Have you ever done it electroncally? You need to be able to speak their language.

It could save this person time, but if they are a long-hours martyr, it won't matter.

They may have trust issues and want to see the details of how things add up (or don't add up). Seriously, you could sum a column in Excel and they'll question it.

Do they use an adding machine or calculator? Have they ever had to enter the same number twice? Has this caused mistakes?

Is a staff member clinging to job and fears being replaced?

You may look at it as an investment, but if they have to purchase hardware, software and pay consulting fees, there's going to be some sticker shock.

Are they aware of anyone else who switched to an electronic system? They may have heard horror stories.

I could go on and on, but other than their lack of accounting software, you didn't mention any other problems. I've never used any tax software because I always hire someone. Maybe I will one day if I can ever file a short form.

What is your motivation in getting your client to switch from manual accounting to computerized accounting? Are you trying to sell him a computerized accounting system? Are you merely concerned how he's managing his finances?

I think the first step is to articulate all the reasons you have in mind:
<br> - What are the PROs of a computerized system?
<br> - What are the CONs of a manual system?

Once you have a list of these PROs and CONs, then you can go to your client and clearly explain your reasons. Or, if you prefer, you can write-up all your findings in a formal proposal, and let your client read and carefully consider your ideas. Good luck!

Disaster recovery. What if their office gets damaged and their paper records are lost? An electronic system can be backed up offsite. 

If that doesn't work then it's you and/or your software that they don't like. Only you can work around that problem.
