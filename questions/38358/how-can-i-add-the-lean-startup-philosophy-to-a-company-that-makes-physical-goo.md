I've read the book and it covers more web/software based companies. What if someone is selling t-shirts, toys, tablets, computers etc.?

A lot of the "lean" methodologies actually came from manufacturing and quite specifically Toyota.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing.

It's too big a topic to be able to give you an appropriate answer here that says "this is how you apply lean philosophies to manufacturing" but hunt around and I am sure you will find plenty of resources on it.  Just keep in mind software companies are adapting older principles, not inventing them.
