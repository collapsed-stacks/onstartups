## Can a Greek letter be trademarked (for use within the scope of a particular service offering)?

Let's say we offer an approach to better dental hygiene and we call it the change™ dental hygiene solution and we represent our change™ solution with the Greek delta (Δ) symbol.  Hence, we might also refer to our solution as the Δ™ dental solution or simply our Δ™ solution.   Let's assume that no one else is using "change" or " Δ" as marks related to dental services., 

Firstly, do both the term and symbol meet the minimum statutory requirements to be eligible as trademarks?  If so, would both the word and symbol be part of the same trademark application or are they two independent marks requiring two independent registrations?

If two applications are required, would it make sense to first apply for the term "change" and if that succeeds, then apply for the symbol, or is there advantage in applying for both at the same time?

My understanding is that trademarks must be unique in some way.

Let's be honest here.. you want to trademark a triangle. Unless you add some sort of decorative something, it's still just a triangle.

Alternatively, you want to trademark a letter. It's not English but if someone in Greece asked about trademarking the letter D, we'd all look at him funny.

Alternatively, you want to trademark a generic word. Considering "Hope and Change" was recently a political tagline, I think the odds are pretty low.


Guy Kawasaki has a great book called "Art of the Start" which talks about mission statements and taglines. Check it out and then decide what you want your brand/product to be. Choose a logo, tagline, etc that resonates with you and feels right with your customers.

(1) It is unlikely that anyone qualified to do so will validate a trademark on an open forum like this.

However, if you do some searching at the trademark electronic search system (TESS) you might be able to answer your own question:

(2) This is a search of a triangle shape with the word "dentist":

You might get some ideas from these results.

It appears that at least one dental office has used a triangle with a word in a single application. Filing a second application might give you more freedom to protect a purely gaphic logo incorporating the delta symbol. 

You can also search "change" in combination with "dental"
