I have a new services business which will be marketing a product to professional services firms in the UK. Unfortunately, for reasons which are unavoidable and not material to this question, I have to live in the US.

So, I need a sales person to go and close the sales. Unfortunately, advertising on gumtree (the UK's equivalent of craigslist) has not helped. No-one I know is especially keen, either.

I'm looking to recruit someone, preferably with a sales or professional services background, who can do the sales for a generous commission (25% of the profits on each sale to the clients they sign up, in the first year of each such client using our service). As this is such a key role, it is almost equivalent to a partner. I'm not sure if that really impacts recruitment strategy at the candidate-solicitation state.

25% of the profits means nothing: how much profit per sale and how many projected sales per year? **Your recruitment strategy will depend on how much these figures represent in potential income.**

If your pricing is low you'll come to realize that selling a low-priced product is a serious marketing challenge. And if your pricing is high, which in turn makes for a long sales cycle, that's also a marketing challenge.

Good luck.
