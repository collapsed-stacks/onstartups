I have created an affiliate program for my web site selling single property websites. I have set everything up on my website to handle it and I don't want to use an affiliate network like Commission Junction to promote it. My marketing place basically consists of

- Promotion via the websites existing Twitter account
- Ramp up the Facebook friends page
- Regular blog posts
- Article submissions
- Being involved in affiliate forums

Is there anything else I should be doing and how would you prioritize these activities.

Google always has free $100 coupons for Adwords.  Get a coupon, and experiment with PPC (I would stick with just the Search network, don't try the content network yet).  Spend your free $100, and measure your ROI.  

Also, do some keyword research (both for your articles and your PPC), and target highly search keywords.

Figure out where your customers hang out, which blogs they visit, which forums they visit, which LinkedIn groups they use, who they follow on twitter, everywhere they hang out.

Then choose the top place and try and speak to them directly - ask for an introduction if possible, email them, call them on the phone and explain to them why they should promote your product. 

Simples.
