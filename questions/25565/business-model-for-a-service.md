To address question #1 and your numbered bullets:

 1. The only apps that make interesting amounts of money on ad revenue have millions of hits per month. You will need mass adoption to make this work.
 2. Payment processing will take a large chunk of your dollar. Again, huge activity will be required to make this viable.
 3. This is where most profitable apps make their living.
 4. There is not enough information to comment on the viability of this option.

Regarding question #2, their focus seems to be to create mass adoption, then sell into big companies with paid services for analytics.
