Make sure you leverage Google Optimizer to run some multivariate testing on your landing page.  That done, frankly, Google is your best choice given the cost.  You aren't going to get much more out of more sophisticated platforms UNLESS you have a complex measure of conversion.

That is, if you are valuing more than one metric: sales PLUS newsletter registrations PLUS referrals, etc. (which you should be doing) than Google doesn't really cut it.  Take a look at KISSmetrics.

<p>You can try <a href="http://mouseflow.com" rel="nofollow">Mouseflow</a> if you want an alternative to Clicktale and a great supplement to Google Analytics. It is relatively cheap and has both recording/replay and heatmap analysis.</p>

You're talking about two completely different tools - clicktale isn't an analytic tool but a testing tool. I'd second Pauls option - using google optimizer is good to do some multivariate landing page testing is a good low cost test to check for conversion.

clicktale (or crazyegg for that matter) can provide clickstream resolution playback to give better heatmaps.

Or - take a look at woopra - more real time analytics than google - still free for some uses.

Indeed you are talking about two different tools: but basically you are both just looking at the stats or behavior or the users, so in that way there the same. I think you next step is DO SOMETHING.

So a testing tool will be next to actually do A/B testing. You can try Google Website Optimizer for basic test of different versions of pages. Get some experience with that and see if you can actually use the things you saw in both tools your currently using.

There is a very good Open Source Application called PIWIK. It is made to serve as a free clone for Analytics. I think it has overtaken Google Analytics meanwhile.

It can be installed on any host running PHP/MySQL.

Here is the URL: http://www.piwik.org/
