I am tech consulting for a few small businesses generally not exceeding 9 employees in my area.  I like being involved in the success of a fellow business by helping them with technology.  I'm at a stage now where I need to find more clients.  My ideal client would be any business who is growing, has more than 7 computers and relies on technology to the extent that when systems are down it's costing them money because I want to focus on providing high availability.  My support methods are quite unique in a field where I find that some if not most companies are not happy with their existing I.T. provider (either because the support is lacking or the prices are too high).  My question is, how can I find that ideal customer who wants more than "geek squad" service for their business?

You need a sales and marketing plan. And then you need to execute them. They will take you time and money. 

Some of the components of your sales and marketing plan could be: 

 - Ask your current clients for leads and referrals and provide them some time of incentive to do so. 
   
 - Purchase from a list provider the company's that fit your profile. You can then communicate your value proposition to them. Way to communicate with them may include mail, email, phone and visiting them.

 - Network with the business owners at Rotary club, Chambers of Commerce, Civic Groups . . . .  

 - Develop cleaver advertising campaign on local media outlets that your target business owner might be listening to. 

 - Developing a network of evangelists that love you and your service and will recommend you when they hear from someone who is ready for something more than the Geek Squad.

 - Find partners who sell services to the same market (web developers, designers, . . .) and offer a reciprocal referral opportunity.

 - Volunteer to do IT for a local not-for-profit that has a board of directors or member base that overlaps your target customer base. 

Good luck in the development and execution of your plan!
