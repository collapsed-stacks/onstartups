I have an idea. I started Googling for investors with immaturity. Well, once I got matured enough I thought first starting a company on my own with the little money I have and later I can find investor if required.

I am bit confused almost... I have few steps but I can't sort them in a manner. Can anybody do it for me?

a) Should I first start a company on my own and then should I search for investor for international expansion?
b) Should I first find investor to start my company wide at the seed stage itself?
c) Should I start my company with my money and once its on track shall I sell it for huge money and should I start a big new company?
d) Or should I sell my idea and make money to start a new business with new idea?
e) Should I catch a similar company in good stage and talk to them for partnership?
f) Should I find a equity partner cum investor to be risk free?
h) `if you have any please add here`

what should I follow? Which of the above makes me a successful business man?

<p>Of the options listed here, there is only one that makes sense. You need to build it yourself. Take whatever resources you have, however limited, and start today.</p>

<p>There's a few reasons for this:</p>

<p>-<strong>Execution is the most valuable part.</strong> Ideas aren't worth a lot, what's worth money is the ultimate execution of that idea. Think about all the different web browsers. Which is your favorite? Anybody out there using Netscape anymore? The web browser idea is the same across all platforms, but the execution of the idea is <em>completely different</em>. We pay for execution.</p>

<p>-<strong>Investors <em>won't</em> invest in your idea right now.</strong> You're idea isn't worth a whole lot. I tell this to people all the time because it is absolutely true. Right now, your idea is intangible. People can't see it or touch it. Until you build it out to where people can <em>experience</em> it, they won't get it.</p>

<p>Don't be discouraged here. If you're idea is great, and you love it, then you should be damn excited to work on it everyday. You should be stoked to learn the skills you don't have because you can't hire it out. </p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong> this community is here to help you every step of the way. And we <em>want</em> to see you build it. </p>

To add to Ryan's answer I'd also say that there is no best path to success. You just find "your" best path.
