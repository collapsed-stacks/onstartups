Few months ago, I started to incorporate a private company in India. Due to legal process overheads, I outsourced the task to a reputed law company.

Now, whole process is almost finished. I want to know what documents should I receive after completion of company incorporation. The law company is reputed, so I am not very concerned about frauds. I actually don't want to be locked-in with the law company for future legal works so that I could use another law company or hire a CA for myself.

List of documents I expect:

 - Certificate of Incorporation
 - MOA and AOA
 - DIN document (not sure if it exists)
 - Challan receipt of payment to RoC

Please, correct my list and tell me if I need any other document for my incorporated company in future.

The 4 documents you listed are all you would receive. Most probably, the outsourced firm used RoC website to make payments, so they may provide you only challan number (not a physical receipt). However, in addition please also ask your firm to hand you the digital-signature purchased in your name (if they did). Also, you will receive the DIN letter at your postal address, your firm won't provide you that.

Adding to @Ashutosh's answer, you need to appoint the Auditor within 1 month of registration. You need to file IT return (depending on, when you registered) and many other taxes. You need to apply for PAN (mandatory), TAN (mandatory), Service tax (may not be needed immediately), VAT (may not be necessary in your field) etc. It is an ongoing process and hopefully law firm that you hired is taking due care of that. If not then switch to another firm/CA which takes care of all the legalities.
