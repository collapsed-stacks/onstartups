I am a complete newbie and this is my first question here.

I was thinking of buying the help of some local web programmers to make a website and start something online. (I don't have much knowledge to build any website on my own). I was thinking of having a website related to tourism. I have no idea whatsoever but I am very interested in moving forward, can somebody guide me in what I should do. Is this really big to think of for a novice?

I don't have much money to start with, but I might take loan from some bank to start it, if it really meant some good business to start with.

There are a lot of online choices (for jobs/business) I saw like GoogleAds, online surveys and many more, I never heard of anybody making money from them really, except for the false claims of the checks/drafts that are posted on the website showing that come people really made money. Does it really work (honestly)?

Please advice or help me in starting any kind of online business. All kinds of suggestions inputs are welcome even if it does not relate much to my question?

Thanks

I try to be honest: 

what does not work is "I try to do something related with x and I have no clue about internet startups".

What do you want to do? How would you like to earn money?

Google Ads work. They work if you buy ads, they also work if you have these ads on your page. But have in mind, I have 5.000 unique visitor per month on my ad driven personal site - i make 90 cent per month. Is this what you are looking for? You probably need 10x so much visitors to earn money hear.

I guess you really need an outlined idea for your business. If it is only related to write content and have some clicks on ads - let you create a blog and put ads there. This can also achieved for free with Blogger.com. You can then try out if you site does reach so many people that you really make some bucks.

From reading your question I recommend you to figure out what you want to do first.

 What kind of website do you want to start? Tourism is a very broad category. How do you plan to make money? From advertising or selling exclusive access? Are you going to produce your own content like articles? Are you familiar with the tourism industry to be an authority figure?


Building something online is easy. Building something people want and also letting them know about it is the hard part.
