I'm not just talking about the initial launch, where you get the traffic spike from contacting all the bloggers, I mean about marketing it right after that point.

At BOS2009, I believe that it was Ryan Carson who shared Kevin Rose's recommendation of always doing an invite-only beta.  The goal is obviously to create some mystery and exclusivity.  It actually doesn't decrease visibility/exposure... you just make sure that the bloggers/press/influencers all get invites.

Just a tip that I thought was pretty solid.

Give people a unique product that solves a specific problem and offers a real value to users.  if you have this, you are 90% of the way there.  Beyond that, just make sure that you have a system to encourage users to share their positive experience with others who might be interested.  You'll be surprised how quickly word spreads when you create something that people want to use. A few good examples:

YouRenew.com

BidModo.com

Mint.com

<p>SEO and inbound marketing are the key.  </p>

<p>Driving people to the site is no longer a black art, there are a number of companies out there that can help bring in the eyeballs.  Jason and Dharmesh's company, <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/" rel="nofollow">HubSpot</a> is by far the best analytics / inbound marketing tool around.  But, you need to understand PPC, SEO - the whole alphabet soup.  </p>

<p>Relish and live in the statistics of your marketing effort.</p>
