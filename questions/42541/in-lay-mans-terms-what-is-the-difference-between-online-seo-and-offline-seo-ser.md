I think you mean "On-Page" SEO and "Off-Page" SEO. 

**On-Page SEO**: On-Page SEO are things that you can do ON a HTML page to tell Google and other search engines about your page. So for example, selecting the right keywords that are relevant to the page's content and using them in the title, optimizing your header tags (h1/h2), the alt-text in images and the meta title and description etc,. are some On-Page SEO techniques. 

**Off-Page SEO**: Off-Page SEO involves things that you do OUTSIDE your page and get more inbound links to your page from other reputable websites. After creating great content in your page, you can submit your site to Directories, start a conversation with sites linking to your competitors and get them to link to you etc,. These are some Off-Page SEO tactics. 

For a given page, On-Page SEO is about 25% important and Off-Page SEO is 75% important. On Page SEO is completely under your control, but Off-Page SEO is not. Off-Page SEO takes time and is very effective.

A final word of caution: If you do sign up for off-page SEO services, make sure you dont get scammed.
