The question really says everything.  Loan rates fluctuate. Are there any good resources to view current business loan statistics, etc.?

In the US, you could go to the [Small Business Administration](http://www.sba.gov) and look up their loan program.

They have a [tool](http://www.sba.gov/loans-and-grants) that allows you to search for loans and grants.
