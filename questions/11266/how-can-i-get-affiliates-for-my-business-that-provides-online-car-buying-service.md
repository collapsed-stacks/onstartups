We are a new business and we provide online car purchase services. Whenever there is a transaction, we would share 20% of the profit with the affiliate. I am looking for affiliates at car insurance websites, car sellers and other niches but none of them are looking to affiliate. Should we contact them and let them know about our program and ask if they are interested?

Yes.

That's an easy question!

If you're not making 75 phone calls a day, you're probably doing it wrong. Start making 75 phone calls a day. If your business idea still doesn't work, change it.

Agreed

In addition I suggest:
Have a simple script written out prior to the calls so you hit your main value propsition points well and a web page for them to find more information on if they to sign up then and there and a means to get back to you easily.  Also make sure the call has a call to action with a closing statment where you are asking them to sign up to something specific.  If they don't like what you first offer ask what is it they don't like and what would entice them.

Also have information of amount of sales you have currently.  Real sales, meaning real money is something a business always wants to say yes to.

Final thoughts if you don't have the sales yet on your site this still may be a feasible idea just need to wait so you have social proof that it is viable to them first.

Luck
