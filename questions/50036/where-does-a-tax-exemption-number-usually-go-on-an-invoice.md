I'm invoicing a tax exempt organization, but am not sure where on the invoice the tax exempt number should go. I've been told that when invoicing a tax exempt organization, the invoice MUST include their tax exempt number. I understand that all invoices are different to some extent, but I'm wondering if there is any kind of convention for this.

To simplify things a little, I've done up a "guess" just to see if it's acceptable. If my placement of the tax exempt number is unusual, let me know how it could be changed. (I've removed my logo and references to  my company and client--hence the big white space in the top left corner). Also, if there are additional ways that it needs to be changed in order for it to be an appropriate invoice to a tax exempt organization, let me know that too!

FYI, I'm located in the US (New York State, not city) and my client is also in New York State (not city).

When I bill Tax Exempt organizations, I don't put their tax exempt number on my invoice to them.  When I set them up in my billing system, I request their tax exempt form for my state and then I set up their account as Tax Exempt.  When I do work for them and print out an invoice, the system knows they are tax exempt and does not charge them any tax.  

Since you are sending them an invoice, you don't have to let them know that they are tax exempt.
