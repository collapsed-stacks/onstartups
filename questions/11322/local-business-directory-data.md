What is the most cost effective way to collect local business directory by location? Data by providers such as infoUSA is expensive for my start-up company.

It might be cost effective to join local trade associations in your target niche, such as your state's restaurant association, etc.  They usually provide members with detailed membership lists.

Excluding infoUSA there is also Hoovers (good  for sales people) and Dunn & Bradstreet. Manta.com may be another good one to try.

What type of companies are you hoping to locate? There are plenty of industry specific directories.
