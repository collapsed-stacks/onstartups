Angels are really busy that they will receive lots of proposals every minute. They formally look at the preface and decide whether to proceed further or to drop the proposal. My company is in seed stage I started my company, I have ideas, I registered my company and getting clients. I company is based on Internet links exchange, advertising, services, application and others. Well, I have a few users now earning a small amount every month. I believe increase in the traffic will increase my earnings. So, I need investors. Do investors concentrate on my application? or do just reject it as mine is a `seed-stage` company. Should I have to show them the growth in clients and earnings while writing? and should I have a minimum of 0.1 Million clients to proceed? or can I start writing today?

It really depends on the investor. Search around, but make sure you're approaching people that will read your application. Some angels will only invest in post-revenue, $1m+ valuations. It really just depends on the investor. It can't hurt trying at this point though. If you're lucky, the angels will let you know why they aren't interested, so you can tune your presentation for the next one you get a meeting at.
