I am registered a LLC with SC state with one US Resident. Later he retired/resigned from the entity and I would like to add new person to same entity. IRS is saying, EFIN is not transferable and not possible to cancel. I want to apply EFIN with IRS for Tax filing. Can you guide me please

If the EIN is that of the LLC, it shouldn't change just because one member retired, or another joined. Are you talking about EIN (sometimes referred to as FEIN) or EFIN (entirely different kind of IRS identification, used by tax preparers)?
