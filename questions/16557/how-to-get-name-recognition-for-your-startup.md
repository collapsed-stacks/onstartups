I was wondering what is a good way to get your company/yourself a known name? Meaning that there obviously several methods to achieve popularity and to provide people a good quality so that they would recommend your company/you, but what are those ways judging from your experience/knowledge of real examples?

Hopefully a marketing type will chime in here, as I'm no expert, but here are some things I've done in building my Drupal consulting firm:

**For personal name recognition:**

 - Speak at conferences, write/edit books, give interviews...anything to get your name in print.
 - Blog with consistent frequency (how often matters a little less than that it is predictable).
 - Use your full name as your handle for the internet services you use (Twitter, etc.).  This is one thing I probably should have done but didn't: as many people in the tech world know me as "HedgeMage" as they do "Susan Stewart" and it can be confusing.
 - Show up in person: conferences, local meetups, etc. let you get face time with others in your industry, and give you exposure as well as the contacts you'll need for speaking engagements, press interviews, etc.

**For company name recognition:**

*This depends a lot on who you are trying to build name recognition with.  A consumer product will approach this in much the same way an individual would: social media, etc.  academic, government, and b-2-b is different.  I'll let someone with more marketing chops get into the specifics.*

<p>The simple answer is to start blogging ASAP.</p>

<p>Other ways to get noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>go to conferences, meet-ups, and networking events</li>
<li>seek reviews from bloggers </li>
<li>seek feedback from industry experts</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote a blog post about <a href="http://blog.zferral.com/post/972974853/startup-marketing-getting-your-startup-noticed-and" rel="nofollow">Startup Marketing and Getting Recognized</a>, it's a bit more detailed -- and worth a quick read.</p>

For a company: Build a brilliant product, that people want. 

For a person: Network, be useful to others, connect people (with care).
