<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

My business partner and I have been working on our project for a couple months. We are 50-50 co-founders both working full-time and splitting the costs evenly. We are at the point where we need a graphic designer for logo design, the six page web design, and the approximately six screen mobile app design.
The graphic designer we are looking to hire as a contractor would like to be compensated in equity. What is an appropriate number??
There is also a good chance we would like to keep him on for additional work down the road..
