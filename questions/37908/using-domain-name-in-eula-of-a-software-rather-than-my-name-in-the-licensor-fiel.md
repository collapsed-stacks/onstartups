<p>What you have is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doing_business_as" rel="nofollow">doing business as</a> (DBA) situation. You own the business (you are the business) and your name is <strong><em>myname</em></strong>. The customer is licensing the software from <strong><em>myname</em></strong>. You also have the situation where you would like to use some other name for your business when dealing with the public and licensing the software, right now that name is <strong><em>somedomain.com</em></strong>. So what you have is <strong><em>myname</em></strong> doing business as <strong><em>somedomain.com</em></strong>.</p>

<p>That is perfectly fine. Depending on where you are located you may need to file a DBA certificate with the appropriate governmental authority.</p>
