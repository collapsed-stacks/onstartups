I am starting a mobile/web development outsourcing company. My development team (currently 4 developers) is moving to my starup from our prev. company, that worked in IT, but not in SD outsourcing.

As a new company, we don't have an outsourcing portfolio - only in-house projects. 

Would a web site be making a bad impression, if we go ahead and be honest that we are a startup, and, therefore, we open to do work at high discounts for services. Also, to place describing text/image where in future our portfolio of projects would be listed.

Or will I make a better impression just not mentioning our age and portfolio at all?

If this is more of a discussion question, and there is no a strong opinion on either side of this - let me know in comments and I will remove the question. Thank you.

Remember that while your company may be new, the people are not new to the business. It is perfectly appropriate to have a section on the website listing your key people along with their experience and projects they have worked on.

As an example:

> John Jones is our Chief Technology Officer. Prior to joining Our Great
> Company he was with General Motors for then years where he was
> responsible for the development of accounting systems.
> 
> Bob Smith - web developer. Prior to joining... Bob was with Little
> Agency for 7 years where he was the senior web developer. Among the
> sites he produced were the websites for Pixar, Apple and Whole Foods.
