What price would you pay for remote eye-tracking services? (per capita)

Considering the following

    * results delivered in 24 hours
    * reliability of the test would be arond 80-90%
    * pricing based on per capita figures
    * tests done with real people (not software generated)

And what kind of results would you like to get?

    * video recordings?
    * heatmaps?
    * fixation order maps?

Pricing strategy would be really flexible: you have to pay only for what you ask!
per capita/considering desired results
