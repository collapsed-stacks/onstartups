Here's the situation at hand.

I'm a designer, entrepreneur. I work with a lot of talented developers etc.

One of my non-technical buddies had an idea for an iOS app. He explained it to be through a brief conversation. It's a simple idea, but has potential to make money.

This was 9 months ago.

Since then, I've recruited a developer and social media manager as co-founders.

Myself and the developer wrote the business plan, designed/developed the app and we're close to launching.

How much should we give my buddy who had the idea? He's contributed very little to the actual project.
