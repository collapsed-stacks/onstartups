This is Niket Shah here from Gujarat, India.
At present, I am a fresher in Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and communications.
I want to start my own business. I have inquired about few streams to start on, but confused about start up.
I have found that field of Automation is a nice one and also has applications of my field; i.e EC. Now i want to step forward in it and want to analyse the market conditions and want to evaluate the competitors. Also i am a fresher and so i dont have the experience of the field. So can some one help me to take me the next step?

Thanks, 
Niket Shah

Though you can start your company directly , if i were you, i would get some experience with some company before starting my own company. Being a fresher, you may have perceptions, beliefs that need to be tested for their validity . That is possible if you work in some company

Few things that you would learn by working for some company in similar domain  
- You would learn about actual product implementation.
- Quality expectations
- Networking with people in your industry
- You would learn pitfalls, industry trends , new buzz in your targeted industry
- You get to talk to senior people and get their guidance.
 
You may start by choosing some companies which are already in this field. Make a list of such companies. Try to find some position in such companies.

Start building something now. Don't waste time trying to aim at a target when arrows are cheap and there are no consequences for missing.  

If you're looking for exposure in your field, maybe one of your professors could connect you with a recent graduate?
