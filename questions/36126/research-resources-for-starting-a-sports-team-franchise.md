I'm thinking of starting up a minor sports team in the world of e-sports and I'd like to model it after the more well-known models in hockey and football.

I've tried going to the official websites for these industries, and there is no public information on how this stuff is modeled.

My goal right now is to find out how pro-league teams model their revenue and compensation structure, and then tweak it for the games/leagues my team would participate in.

thanks

(there's no existing tag for sports so I couldn't add it)

Identify who would buy one of your franchisees and model it so it appeals to them. You may want the to "feel" like they're part of the big leagues, but you don't have to follow the model that close.

The pro sports model caters to people who have and/or can borrow large sums of money. TV contracts guarantee a certain amount of revenue; you may not have that luxury. Physical location limits may not be something you need to worry about unless you want to boost local interest by attaching a franchise to a city.

**Key areas of an agreement cover:**

 - Ownership and Transfer of ownership rules
 - Fees: upfront, on-going, and percentage of revenue
 - Territory:
 - Length of Contract and cost to renew
 - Expectations: how much marketing or other activities required
 - Providing Training and support
 - Behaviors that can get a franchisee kicked-out (There has to be a
   better term for this.).

Different States in the US have their own laws and registration requirements. I don't know if this applies to you, but it is specific to where the owner resides and not where they do businesss.
