I am a female programmer/software developer and basically a 'techpreneur'. I just finished work on a web app to provide advertising and marketing campaigns for companies. I coded everything from scratch and have invested money into building it. That is for the domain name and VPS Server. 

Right now, I am ready to launch the business. I have read a lot of entrepreneurial books and articles and I am very good at giving business advice to my friends. However, I am confused right now as to whether I need a partner or just a team of 3 (me inclusive) to help with the marketing aspect which I will also help with since I have quite some knowledge in that field too. Or I just need to tell my friends about the business and get people to connect me. But the truth is, I like taking decisions with people and feel that is the reason I need a partner. I do not want to confuse emotional feelings with business.

I am being careful because I am a lady and I do not want the company to slip out of my hands. I want full control of the business even though I am ready to give out some shares of the company out to those who will support me. 

I want to know if I need to get a partner to help me make decisions and the qualifications I should look out for.( and I just want to throw this in that, I am in my final year in college). So should I get a college friend to help me out? or should I dive into the real world and get a marketer, taking into the consideration not being played in a wrong way.

Erm... being a lady has **nothing** to do with it. If you begin your business believing that you are less or deficient entirely because of your gender, you will lose. There people who take advantage of the naive/uninformed/weak and you're describing yourself that way already.

You *might* be uninformed or deficient.. but just about everyone is somewhere, regardless of gender, background, skills, etc.


Most people don't **need** a partner, especially starting off. Yes, there is a lot of stuff to do, but since you have few/no customers, the support, sales, management, etc efforts are much smaller.

That said, some people *should have* a partner to complement the skills they're missing. For example, I know the technical side and some of the marketing, but sales is my (biggest) weak spot. If I want a project to be successful, *should* get someone to help there.

On the bank account side, never open an account with someone you don't trust completely. Quite often it's easy for one person to spend/take a large sum (or all) of the money out with few controls. That is *good* in many cases where you need to buy high value equipment, services, etc.. but it is risky.

Regardless, you will want to have a separate bank account. I don't know what country you're in but a good rule is to keep finances as separate as possible.

<p><strong>Developing software is the easy part.</strong></p>

<p>Creating a business where specific customer segments are willing to pay for a solution which results in a cash flow positive effort is the real challenge here. </p>

<p>Given that the goal is profitability (which is my assumption) I believe you have some misconceptions about what marketing is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>..help with the marketing aspect which I will also help with since I have quite some knowledge in that field too. Or I just need to tell my friends about the business and get people to connect me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marketing isn't a software feature... its an ongoing effort that requires constant monitoring complete with trial and error experiments. In fact, marketing isn't important at this juncture if market validation / customer development hasn't been done and the value proposition to the customer and their willingness to pay isn't known. In short, a whole lot more effort than just telling your friends about it.  </p>

<p>If you read some of the books on Lean startups (vs articles), most would point out that customer development should be done by a senior member (you) to validate market / product fit, come up with a <a href="http://www.agilebok.org/index.php?title=Minimally_Marketable_Feature_%28MMF%29#Steps_towards_a_Minimal_Marketable_Product" rel="nofollow">minimal marketable product</a> and launch / modify / pivot as you get real feedback. </p>

<p>Many would say that marketing prior to validating market fit is a wasted effort. I would think that hiring 2 marketing heads in a pre-launch startup would be premature. But where you are in customer development and what you consider marketing efforts may be different that my interpretation.</p>

    Control is good.

If you'll get partners, what will they invest? Compare their possible investment to yours. Make it into what comprises 100%. Unless the investment is equal to your thoughts of how much your software is worth, they'll unlikely get anywhere near 30% anyway.

Then draft your contract/agreement for what they hold in the company.

At this point when you're suddenly getting technical, you might scare away possible partners.

However, don't let it bother you. A lot of people get burned for "trying" to come up with contracts after the fact.



But to answer your question, at this time, get yourself a team to work under you.

**Partners and shares**... these will cloud your early days. This is all just my opinion so I'd like to say that if you want control, get control. Lead a team under you. No shares, even if you might need the money for investments. At least for as long as you can. The reason for this is because-- 

    When you hit it big, you may want advice from people you trust, 
    but you won't want them eager to grab a piece of the cash-out pie.
    Many people act differently when it comes to money matters.

So keep your head above water, swim with a team, not with partners who have ropes tied to your waist -- the last thing you want is a partner who'd rather drown and take you with him/her.
