I am starting a for-profit online donation platform. My company currently is an LLC and I have gotten conflicting reports on whether or not I need to convert to a 501(c)(3) so that the passthrough funds are still tax-deductible. I don't think I should but one CPA said yes and the other no. This is a US-based company. I'm so confused!

As far as I know the 501c3 is only for Not For Profit organisations. See http://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=96099,00.html for eligablity criteria.

If your a for profit organisation then you are an LLC or similar variant.

In my experience and IANAL, it depends mostly on the purpose to which the funds will be put. 

Contact the CPA that does your company's books (you have one, right?) and follow her advice. That way, if you are advised incorrectly and the Fed come calling, you have some recourse.
