I am currently researching e-Learning, and I'm hoping to launch a service similar to Khan Academy in the next year. It would offer learning tools for students all over the world. How should such a service be monetised (i.e. start to make a profit) over time? How feasible is it?

There are 2 main ways to monetize an online product:

1. Advertising supported.  
**Pros:** Easy to get started with products like AdSense (Google's platform). If/when your traffic gets a steady/high traffic (over a million impressions a month) you could try to sell ads at higher rate or get sponsorship deals. 
**Cons:** It will probably not be enough to cover the cost of operations in the early years (sorry, yes it could take a few years to start making profit) unless traffic grows fast.

2. Subscription-based.
**Pros:** Users subscribing to service is pretty much proof that your product/service is something needed and users are willing to pay for. This model can help you cover expenses early on. 
**Cons:** It's easier to grow a business by offering your product for free and getting feedback on the product first. Processing subscriptions will require at a minimum a PayPal or Google checkout and eventually you want to be able to accept credit cards, so that requires some development time.
