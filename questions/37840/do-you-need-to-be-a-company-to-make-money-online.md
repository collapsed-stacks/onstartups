A friend and I have a great startup idea which we plan to put into action at the beginning of the summer. We've also worked some revenues into our business model by allowing users to pay for some perks.

By law, do we need to create a company to receive this cash? I saw another similar question, but only advice was given. We live in Canada, and we're unsure if we HAVE to be a registered company before receiving any kind of profits online.

No, you don't have to form a distinct entity to do so. This is called running a "sole proprietorship":

That said, business owners form distinct business entities to protect themselves from certain forms of liability. Furthermore, most online payment processors require the existence of such an entity.
