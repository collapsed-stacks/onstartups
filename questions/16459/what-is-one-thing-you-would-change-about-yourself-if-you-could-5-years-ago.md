I've got two things:

 1. **Obsessing over the little details.** I have a need for perfection. I would spend 50% of my time fixing that last 1% of imperfection. A lot of times good enough is good enough, but I have a hard time accepting that. I've actually ruined things in the process of trying to make them perfect. I've gotten a lot better about this over the last year, but it's still something I struggle with.
 2. **Lack of networking (being shy).** I used to have a terrible time with social events, and meeting new people. I guess it's my engineering mentality, but thinking about having to talk to people I don't know stresses me out. I've gotten a lot better about this over the years, but this is also something I still struggle with.

Stop playing games, learn English, and start a company. Don't let being 12 hold you down!

Ps: Maybe this is more of a programmers question?
