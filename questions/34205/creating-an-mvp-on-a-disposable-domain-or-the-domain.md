If you are putting together an MVP in the form of say a ppt presentation hosted at slidshare and then embedding it on a basic webpage, would you use a disposable domain, by disposable i mean still a purchased domain (not a freebie) or would you use a domain that you intend to be the actual startup domain used for the long term.?

Partly my reason for asking is that we all understand the reason for building a minimum viable product, and since an initial hypotheses might turn into something quite different im thinking about how a domain might become/sound less relevant as you work through the customer discovery step of customer development.

Personally I like the idea of having a "real" domain with a landing page as early as possible. The landing page can be simple and should perhaps include a link to signup to be notified when the beta becomes available. This helps you gather a list of potential customers, which is a good thing.

As for exposing to the world a PPT presentation or even a working, and possible buggy and incomplete, alpha stage prototype I would not want to do so. Put such items behind a password protected link so that your partners can get at it but search engines like Google will not.
