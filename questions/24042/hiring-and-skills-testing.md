Does anyone know of a comparable service to test a users skills to what they provide on elance?  I like the ability to test various skills but I'm not sure if it preferable to have them set up an account and be exposed to all that is elance if I want to hire them for a full time job.

I find the best way to test someone's skills is to look at previous work they have done.  And, if I know I'm going to need certain skills, to actually test for those skills in particular.  In my case this worked because I was knowledgeable about the problem domain I was hiring for.  If you don't have those skills, well, you might not actually know which skills to test for.

If you have friends that have the skill sets you are hiring for (but maybe you can't afford them), you might come out better getting them to do the interview/testing.
