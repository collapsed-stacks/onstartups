<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

I have been meaning to get on with my idea and first thing - the domain for its website. Naturally it was already taken, could not come up with alternatives. 

Given my supposedly non web-browser centric kind of business (I'm going to make some mobile app which will ultimately deliver information, so the site could be also browsed for info, blog entries, etc), would it be a safe practice not to choose a .com domain ?
So instead of having barge.com I am thinking about bar.ge. Hmm...

Thank you!

People and even browsers expect you to be a .com.  It's just a fact of today's network life.  After all, no one would even think of going to pep.si and they have serious brand name recognition.

The "big ones" for commercial types are .com (but register .net and perhaps even .org as well), .info, and .biz.  However, due to marketing and other pressures, .com is the de facto standard in the domain business.

Note also that ICANN is approving numerous other top level domains soon (TLD) but I doubt any of those are worth holding out for, and you'd not get a TLD on a shoestring budget.
