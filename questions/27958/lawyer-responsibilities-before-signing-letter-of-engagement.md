While searching for the best lawyer for my startup, I gave one of them some documents that I'd like to be returned. No letter of engagement was never signed with this lawyer/law firm. I know I can just ask for them back but I'd like to make sure he doesn't keep copies of them.  What's the industry standard? I'd like to know what my options are?

Write him a nice letter and ask him to return the documents and to destroy any copies that may exist.  

He should comply simply as a matter of professional courtesy, but as an attorney, he must comply unless there are unusual circumstances (e.g., he would need the document for a fee dispute or the documents relate to a crime).

Are there any reasons that you think he might not comply?  If so, please add those to your question.
