For a software business, how long did it take to get:

* Your first $1 in revenue?
* Your first $100 in revenue?
* Your first $10,000 in revenue?
* Your first $100,000 in revenue?


**Intent**

Hopefully we can get a whole bunch of results that can be averaged out... That way founders have a bit of a rough guide on when they maybe should be looking to alter things. "Hey, it has taken me to eight times longer than normal to generate my first $100 of revenue, what am I doing wrong?"

<p>I run a custom software development business. </p>

<p>We did our first job for $2000, which bought the first computer.</p>

<p>It took 1 year to get to $100,000
it took 2 years to get to $250,000</p>

<p>14 years later there is $xM per year.</p>

<p>But we don't sell product, we don't have a website which waits for a sale, we don't advertise, we didn't do any marketing besides word of mouth for the first 3-4 years.</p>

<p>If your trying to get a feel for the two extreemes have a listen to </p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://bit.ly/gpMmxM" rel="nofollow">This week in startups</a>. These people generally get funding for 2 years+ and the majority don't try and make much money within that time, they are focused on getting a huge amount of continual traffic which can then be monitised.</li>
</ul>
