The main difficulty is that you have chosen a theme (sports) that is already well covered and extremely competitive, due to all the money involved. You make it worse by suggesting you'll cover "multiple sports", which means you'll have no focus.

Your budget of $15,000 probably doesn't even cover the running costs for a day, for one of the big sports sites.

You shouldn't give up, but you need to find a niche that you can exploit, and build from.

**First a Plan**

After you have written a business plan you will know you actual cash need. The cash need will be the total amount that you need until your projected break even. The break even will be when your projected revenue exceeds your expenses. This is usually estimated on a monthly basis. Then you will be able to answer the question of whether the amount you have put aside is sufficient for launching your business. 

**Understanding the variables**

There are two significant variables that will impact the amount you will need. The first is the degree to which you can contain your costs and ramp up slowly and incrementally to match an increase in both users and customers. The second will be the ability you have to securing paying customers quickly. 

**Why We Can't Really Answer**

No one, not even the smartest people on this board can truly answer your question because we don't have sufficient information. We don't know how much of the work you will be bootstrapping, what creative and innovative marketing and advertising models you have for securing customers, if you will have customers right out of the gate. Heck-- based on what oyu have told us -- we don't even know what your business model is! 

**But, what the heck -- we will anyway.**

So of course we will all chime in based on assumption anyway. My assumption is that you are creating a content rich site that will try to attract users-- whose provide you will sell to prospective advertisers in the very competitive sports space. based o nthat I assume that you will need a super atrractive site-- which will cost some money -- with some super attractive features -- which  will cost money -- that display some super cool content -- which will cost money -- and that you will need to cut through the noise -- which will cost money.  

So based on all of those assumption -- I think it would be hard to see a credible business plan that showed an ability to break even with $10,000 cash and a $5,000 line of credit.

Some ways of reducing your operational costs: use YouTube/Vimeo for video until you have enough money to pay for streaming (which can get very expensive, esp. for sports videos that tend to get a lot of views).
