I am planning to start a blog that publishes information about our company and developments in the area of education and technology. Any pointers on which is better and more feature rich, Wordpress or Blogger. Specifically I am looking at the following points:

 - customization
 - RSS
 - ability to publish multimedia (images, video, audio)
 - Connecting to a custom domain (e.g. www.mydomain.com)

<p>Wordpress is much more feature rich than Blogger with many <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins" rel="nofollow">plugins</a> that you can use to tailor it to your requirements.</p>

<p>I would go with hosting your own instance of Wordpress rather than using the wordpress.org service.</p>

<p>It need not be expensive, and many hosts will provide a simple one click install.  GoDaddy are cheap, and served me well.</p>

<p>This will give you full control over your blog, it's plugins, designs, avoiding any restrictions which a hosted service places upon you, now or in the future.</p>

<p>Definitely <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/" rel="nofollow">MovableType</a> if you haven't consider it. The backtrack and template system is much better than wordpress.</p>

Combination of Wordpress and Headway theme has been a huge time saver for me. Blogger just does not give you enough hacking ability. I will be contrarian here and say that Thesis for Wordpress is WAY over-hyped. Headway is easier to mess with and takes less time to make it work. I have recently shown a friend how Headway works and she went back to Thesis folks for a refund.

Hope this helps.
