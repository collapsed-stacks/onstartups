<p>According to literature on the state of Delaware's website, LLC's formed in Delaware are at least liable for a flat fee:</p>

<p><em>Although Limited Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies and General Partnerships formed in the State of Delaware do not file an Annual Report, they are required to pay an annual tax of $250.00.  Taxes for these entities are to be received no later than June 1st of each year.</em></p>
