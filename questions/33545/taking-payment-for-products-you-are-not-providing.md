## Taking payment for products you are not providing

I'm wondering how companies operate that take credit card payment for products they are not providing.

For instance, half.com allows users to sell their books through their website. Buyers can purchase listed books with credit card, in which half.com then transfer the money to the seller through ACH.

I'm wondering how half.com prevents chargebacks and fraud. And how do they get accepted by merchant services?


If anyone has any knowledge on resources on this subject it would be very helpful. Thanks

1) They provide drop-dead outstanding customer service.

2) They typically have Terms of Service written that protect them VERY well (see eBay, Amazon, Half)
