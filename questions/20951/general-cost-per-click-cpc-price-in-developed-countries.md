I know this question is a bit artificial, please don't explain me the concept, etc. because I am a professional senior e-marketer. I was just wondering how much do you think one general link click (not really targeted in any ways, except from  maybe language or country) is worth. So, say I have a very general website (like youtube clone, or dating site, whatever) and I would like to attract attention of 1000 people (meaning get 1000 clicks). How much could I be charged for that in your opinion?

because the question is super general, but i am not allowed to argue that it can not be answered (see comments), then my answer is - between $0.01 and $1000 which is the only correct answer anyone can give given the information provided.

why it is impossible to answer it?

however this $3.50 is super general and not a representative sample, and it is therefore impossible even to give a percentage of statistical error 1, 5, 50,99%? anyone's guess.

I would say it all depends on the network and volumes you are looking at, for developed countries my last bulk campaign averaged $0.12 a click from 'search' And around 0.08 from 'other' sources.

These other sources are usually social media clicks sold on bulk, completely untargeted besides the country.

Then you can also buy by 'hit' with general e-mailers that at the end it would run you at about 0.03 per click.

I hope this helps.
