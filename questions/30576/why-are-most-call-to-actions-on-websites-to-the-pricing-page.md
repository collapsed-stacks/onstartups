I am just wondering why most standard web 2.0 websites have the main call to action button on the homepage send the visitor to the pricing page? This is assuming a pretty typical navigation structure for the site that includes a tour page. Even though ultimately you want the visitor to hit the pricing page and sign up, I would have thought the conversion rate would be higher if they went via the tour page first.

Why do people not have the tour page as the main call to action, with the tour page then trying to funnel them to the pricing page?

A good example is 37signals and http://www.basecamphq.com

Is this just a case of everyone following without questioning, or is there some solid logic/evidence behind it?

I realise that A/B testing will ultimately be the best way to know what works for your own site, but this is such a prolific trend that I am curious if it is evidence based.

When you refer to a "pricing page," what you're really talking about are landing pages. They are designed to convert visitors to customers - the ultimate objective of the site. Sending them to a "tour" page in between places obstacles in your conversion path that lower the chances that someone will convert.

It depends upon the product, of course. In the case of Base Camp, there's no tour because they're offering a free trial where users can get an inside look. And so the landing page concentrates on removing doubt with testimonials and assuring visitors how quick and easy it is. The idea is that the best way to convince folks to become customers is to get them to try it.
