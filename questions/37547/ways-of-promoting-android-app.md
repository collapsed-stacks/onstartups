I created a few applications. One of them is very good and users like it. However, I can not increase the number of installations to more than 50 per day. It is very small. The program is unique, complex, but very useful.

Within one month I did:

 1. Advertise on AdMob ($50)
 2. Advertise on AppBrain ($100)
 3. Announcements posted on 7-8 popular forums
 4. Announcements posted on Facebook pages
 5. I released a simple app with advertising the main app

But all these had very weak effect. Now, the app has 1700 installs. A month has passed!

What else can I do? Maybe my translation of texts so bad? English is not my native language and I know it badly.

<p>Search for App Store Optimization in google, it's a new branch of SEO which is catching on and is very relevant to you.</p>

<p>Also look at <a href="http://appannie.com" rel="nofollow">AppAnnie.com</a> to receive insights about apps and your ranking in different locations, that way you can know where to focus your marketing efforts in localized versions or what not.</p>

<p>I would also recommend doing some A/B testing with application name as key-word optimized app names will appear higher.</p>

Or you can try the following:

1) "Not so honest way": make a lot of google accounts, get the market install on emulator, download and rate 5 stars on your own app. Write your own nice reviews.

2) "More honest": embed in your app the reminder to rate. Don;t show it right away but after some time.

For increasing the number of installations or downloads you need to have a solid marketing strategy. You should try the following:

1. App review websites
2. Swap banner ads
3. Social Media Marketing
4. Video Marketing

I have used these ways for promoting my app, and it helped me a lot in increasing the number of downloads.

1. **Fix your translation.** If you think your translation to English is bad, pay someone to do it for you. You can probably outsource this to someone fairly inexpensively using a service like eLance or oDesk.
2. **Run a contest.** You might be able to create some buzz by sponsoring a contest around your app. The more creative your contest the better results you'll see.
3. **Get blogger reviews.** You mentioned that you posted announcements on popular forums, but it's more powerful if an independent party touts your app. Contact bloggers in your niche and ask them for a review. Take a look at http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6806/how-to-request-a-review-from-bloggers for advice on this. You may even want to consider giving the blogger a free copy to give away on his blog. For startup sites that do reviews take a look at:

- http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/13705/sites-where-you-can-promote-your-startup 
4. **Get app store reviews.** Having positive reviews in the app store is important. Give away a few free copies of your app in exchange for reviews in the app store. You can't *require* a positive review, but I think people tend to be more forgiving when reviewing apps in this situation. You can announce this on Facebook, Twitter, and relevant forums.
