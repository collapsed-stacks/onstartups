We have created a product which to date has been privately funded. From conceptual to working prototype with more success than expected. It is a B2B product and industry insiders see legitimacy and value for this product but this a traders business and not a well known environment for the general public. This is a product that we have been told will revolutionize the landscape of trade much like level 3 trading changed day trading methodology. This is very relevant to how stockbrokers trade and how unless you are in this business it would be foreign to most outsiders.

With this said, on the outside we are in a 370b global electronics manufacturing market and our product in truth protects shareholder profitability and counter acts against counterfeiting.

Here is our dilemma, we inadequately analyzed the need and the amount of resource needed to properly run this business. Hence the need for capitalization. To compound matters we have won exclusive distribution contracts from global EMS firms and with a skeleton staff we cannot properly go do expos and road shows for start up although we see a need.

Here is our question, should we find a high profile investment connected individual to get behind this product to go find us expansion capital OR abandon all the good we have created to go full bore into the investment sector ourselves? This obviously could affect our customer retention adversely though.

Thank you for and insight, it is always appreciated

<p>From your responses, it sounds like one approach would be to find a logistics partner.  You could talk to <a href="http://www.ups.com/bussol?loc=en_US&amp;WT.svl=PriNav" rel="nofollow">someone like UPS</a> about how they could help you navigate the logistics / "bricks and mortar" side of your business.</p>

<p>Apart from delivering packages, UPS can get deeply involved in the fulfillment side of any business.</p>

<p>They may also have suggestions as to how to capitalize what you need to do.</p>

If you have orders then you can find a factor and get a loan based on that.  Not sure though from your question. 

Luck

it sounds like you need to find a partner that has experience in logistics execution unless i am reading this all wrong - It sounds to me like you need a strategic partner that already is in position to help you execute with most of the resources you need already in place leaving you guys free to focus on what you do best - not sure it is helpful but it is my best read...
