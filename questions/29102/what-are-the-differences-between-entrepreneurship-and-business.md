In what ways is entrepreneurship different as compared to business? 


My intuition says that every entrepreneur is a businessman but the opposite is not necessarily true. Is there difference in the two in terms of innovation, risk, management, etc?

Not sure I am totally getting your question but here are my thoughts:

I think it is primarily about innovation and improvement.

If you start a landscaping company today you aren't really innovating and being that entrepreneurial.  Any business you get will be at the determent of another landscaping company. There isn't any creation of any 'new' jobs and you aren't probably moving that industry forward.

So, I think a lot of it is about making a way of creating new jobs, innovating, or offering a significant improvement to a current market or industry.

Also, if you are a banker, a land lord, accountant you are a 'businessman' but not necessarily an entrepreneur. 

Entrepreneurs create an atmosphere for others to grow, innovate and for others to get jobs and provide for their families.

<p>Steve Blank is famous for rightly saying that entrepreneurs (startups) are <a href="http://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-principles/" rel="nofollow">companies searching for business models</a>, while normal companies execute and grow existing business models.</p>

<p>I find it's a very accurate description.</p>

Marketing is creating a need. Entrepreneur. Push style marketing. 

Business owner is satisfying a want. Business owner. Pull style marketing.
