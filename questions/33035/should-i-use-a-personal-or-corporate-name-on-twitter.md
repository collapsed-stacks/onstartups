From reading a number of books on social media marketing, it seems that way to use Twitter is to build relationships in that universe that ultimately lead to greater traction for your principle business. 

We have secured the name of our company on twitter and even have a few followers despite never having tweeted.

My question before we start working this medium in earnest is whether instead of using our corporate name, we should register separately as individuals and establish ourselves as "experts" as individuals.

Any thoughts are appreciated,

You should do both.  Let's look at a few examples. 

 - Rand Fishkin, CEO of SEOMoz tweets under @randfish but the company tweets under @seomoz
 - Joel Spolsky, Founder of Fog Creek tweets under @spolsky but the company tweets under @fogcreek
 - Mark Pincus, CEO of Zynga tweets under @markpinc but the company tweets under @zynga

The company twitter account serves several purposes:

 1. Provides a channel for customers to interact with the company,
    provide feedback, ask for support, etc
 2. Provides a channel for the company to provide product and company updates
 3. Belongs to the company. The company account is a way to build a relationship with customers.  You may pass this off to another employee at some point

Your personal twitter account serves different but equally as important purposes:

 1. Can position you as a thought leader (expert) in the space
 2. Builds your personal reputation and brand
 3. Allows you to engage with friends and family
 4. Will always be yours
