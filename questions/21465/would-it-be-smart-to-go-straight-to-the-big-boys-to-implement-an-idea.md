## Would it be smart to go straight to the big boys to implement an idea?

I have an idea that I want to bring to life that I believe will revolutionize the way we take care of our health and as a result improve our healthcare industry by reducing costs for health care. So with that said, I am like many other entrepreneurs out here, 

I dont have money to cover my legal protections first, 
and then the rest for turning this idea into a reality. 

So as a result, I have been thinking about creating a business plan that is already done and heading out to the big corporate monsters that I think would be able to provide the care (financials, staffing, etc) that I need to make this a success and pitch my idea out to them. However, I am curious to know what people think of this before I do such a thing and if it is a smart step to take. Another thing that I would like for people to consider is that timing is essential to success and that is why I am in a bit of a rush to get this started but I dont have the support and the financial backing to make this happen.

From what I understand about your situation, it's going to be a waste of time to write a business plan and try for investment right now.

Why? Several reasons.

 - It's hard to raise money when you're unable to make any progress without it. If you're helpless without money why would you be helpful with?
 - Your business as-is will be very capital intensive (hiring a bunch of people) during the does-this-fit-with-reality phase of your idea. Investors stand to lose a lot of money during the riskiest phase of the business.
 - You compete with folks who have *something* (customers, prototype, etc) in the investor's eyes. Even though you don't really *compete* with any particular company that's raising, it sucks if you're "behind the curve".
 - Investors care more about execution and team than the raw idea. An idea is just a thought without the skill to make it real. Doesn't really matter how good it is.

Instead, you should do as much as you can to validate and de-risk your idea. How many customers can you find? Will any commit to pay? Can you convince others to join you? Can you build a prototype or proof-of-concept?

This goes beyond pitching investors, it's really great for *you*. You don't want to waste your valuable time/money going down the wrong path. You may discover you made a faulty assumption and will want to adjust. It's better when that happens sooner rather than later.

if you believe in the idea, and if you can acquire a patent for the idea or invention, do that before approaching any "big boys".  Dont expect a NDA to protect you, IT WILL NOT.  Even a patent will not protect you, but gives them incentive to take you out of the picture for a reasonable low dollar amount. 

I dont want to be a dick, but its very hard to raise investments for large innovations in healthcare and pharma.  These items take a long time and a lot of money to bring to the market.  If your idea is really good, dont be discouraged.  Might find an angel or vc who believes in the idea and has the right connects.  Make sure to cover your ass with a patent. 

PS patents can get EXPENSIVE!

Instead of talking to the corporate "big boys", how about approaching bright students and researchers studying health care and/or medicine at top universities with your idea? Get together a team that's interested and see if they can help you materialize it in exchange for some equity. Some of them may have connections to smaller health care providers that may be open to implementing your idea in some form.

"I have an idea that I want to bring to life that I believe will revolutionize the way we take care of our health and as a result improve our healthcare industry by reducing costs for health care."

I believe you. Now show me evidence it's practical, wanted, and no one else is trying to make it happen from the inside.

I have an idea that would do the same thing I think... require all health care to be non-profit. (Easier said just like most big ideas.)


(And you can't protect an idea ... patents protect instances of ideas, or a specific process for code.)
