<p>I'm in the process of creating an agreement with a business partner. He needs investors. I introduce potential investors to him. If someone I introduce to him invests in one of his projects, he is expected to pay me 10%. Now I am thinking about the  period of validity. Should there be a period of validity? I mean, if I introduce someone named A to him, and A invests in one of his projects 10 years later, should I still get paid 10%? I am thinking about a validity of 8 years? I'm thinking about if it is reasonable. I want to maximize my interests, but I don't want my proposal looks ridiculous or my partner thinks I am greedy. Please advise.</p>
