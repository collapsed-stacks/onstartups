Hope all is well. I just conducted a round of feedback interviews with 20 people(mostly students) about my startup. The results are 50% saying its a great idea and other 50% think its not worth it. I will be conducting more interviews. I am just wondering how many people should I be interviewing before trying to reach a conclusion.
My value proposition is to create a platform for fans to have a meaningful interaction with their heroes and icons from all walks of life. It is a platform that allows you to ask questions, and seek advice from people who have accomplished laurels in life. I am starting with a niche of sports. Already in communication with couple of athletes and have shown interest to come on board

Also I am trying to create buzz and awareness for few days before launch. 
Any feedback would be great.

Please consider this: Instead of asking their opinion, ask for their money. Or time. Or effort.

The "Yeah, that would be cool, sure dude, I would try it!" is too cheap to be reliable, and you should not rely on them. Something's gotta give.

Do not believe me, read up on this topic.

Really, you should be asking, "Is this feasible?" not "Is this a good idea?". Personally, I'm not a big fan of the idea (I don't think it's the next Facebook or Twitter) but I guarantee you that if you like it, a million other people will like it as well. The biggest issue you're going to face is the fact that you're trying to connect people. My first startup had this same issue. What person wants to traffic a site that tells you that you can catch up with your favorite stars when there are few, if any stars on the site? What stars will want to use a site to communicate with fans when there are no fans? If you have some stars that really love the idea and want to make it work, then I think it can work. Focus on getting fans of those stars on board first. Prove to the stars that it's worth it and the fans will follow. 

A few practical points: If you're expecting to make any money in the first 6-12 months, forget it. You're probably going to lose a decent amount of money. If you think it's going to replace Facebook or Twitter, forget it. Those are giants. Leverage them, and add value that someone won't find on those sites. Give fans a reason to come to your site instead of following the star on Facebook, Twitter or Google+.

Hope that helps!
