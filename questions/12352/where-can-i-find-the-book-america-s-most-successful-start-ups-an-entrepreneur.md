<p>welcome to this site! :-)</p>

<p>That thesis looks <em>very</em> interesting -- please write back here if you find it and it's useful for others.</p>

<p>As to how to get it; it seems to be out of print and uncommon in the second hand bookstores as well. You could try a research library or university library near you. I don't know which country you're in, but in my country these are often open to the public even if they don't advertise this, and the librarians are skilled at finding obscure scientific articles...</p>

<p>Last but not least, you could try <a href="http://www.europeanfounders.com/" rel="nofollow">emailing the author</a>. Maybe he has a PDF or similar lying around, which he might agree to send to you...</p>

I found "America's Most Successful Startups. Lessons for Entrepreneurs" through my university library. Took them a while .. but it is well worth waiting for.
