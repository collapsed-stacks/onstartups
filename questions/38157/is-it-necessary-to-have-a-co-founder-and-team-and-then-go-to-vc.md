I have  single-handedly written all code needed for an alpha/beta till date.

Now i want to go beta and hire marketing professionals and a developer.
For that i need money and VC funds.

Shall i look for a Co-founder before going to VCs?? 


Do they finance projects with only one founder and no team and let me hire it after funding.

Why do you want VCs?  Have you considered angel investment?  As a solopreneur you're more likely to get angel funding than VC funds.  VCs like to see solid teams and solid propositions before they give you a pile of cash.

At this stage I would look for a co-founder or mentor that can take you through the early stages of building the business.  My advice would be to go out to the market with your product as early as you can with *something*.  This would give you the validation that you're going down the right path.  Ask yourself if you need funding to do this.
