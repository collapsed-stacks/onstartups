What should a company do before they switching their domain name? (In my example it's a small change in the name like DropBox's **getdropbox.com** to **dropbox.com**)

I'm thinking about writing a blog post and newsletter to inform the customers about the domain change. 
Any other things?

**You should have both domains.**

Next, you must switch to serving your site on `dropbox.com` and create *301 redirection* from `getdropbox.com` to `dropbox.com`

Before you add this *301 redirection*, check that everything works great on new domain, maybe site have static references to old domain.
