<p>I'm new to all this, but I've begun looking into ways to seek investment for my startup idea. I've got enough experience I believe and skills to see my idea through development but I'm not sure if I should mention on my investment proposal that I flunked my final year of university.</p>

<p>On the one hand it's honest to mention it, do investors appreciate honesty? But on the other hand it may send alarm bells ringing. Personally I know it won't affect my ability to get the job done as my skills are mostly self taught.</p>

<p>If I don't mention it it's difficult to explain where I was for a quite recent three year period in my life.</p>

<p>Would greatly appreciate a bit of advice.</p>
