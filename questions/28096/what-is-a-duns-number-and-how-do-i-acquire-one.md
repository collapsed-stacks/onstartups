I'm looking into distributing an iOS app outside of the App Store. In order to join Apple's Enterprise development program, I am required to have a DUNS number. What exactly is a DUNS number and how do I acquire one? What is involved as a private individual, going from no official paperwork or incorporation?

<p>DUNS stands for "Data Universal Numbering System.". These numbers are issued by <a href="http://www.dnb.com/" rel="nofollow">Dun and Bradstreet</a> (D&amp;B), a private company that tracks information about businesses and their credit worthiness. DUNS numbers are nine digits long.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will find <a href="http://smallbusiness.dnb.com/establish-your-business/12334338-1.html" rel="nofollow">this information</a> helpful on D&amp;B's site and also <a href="http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/duns.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
