I will be offering services virtually through my online business.  What options are there for accepting payment electronically? There is the obvious one PayPal, but are there any others worth looking into?

<p><a href="http://www.paypal.com" rel="nofollow">Paypal</a> definitely has the lead, however you may find it simpler to use <a href="https://checkout.google.com/buyer/tour.html" rel="nofollow">Google Checkout</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/" rel="nofollow">Google Wallet</a>(for mobile), which are both easy to integrate using the <a href="http://code.google.com/more/table/" rel="nofollow">Google APIs</a>.</p>

<p>PayPal sucks.  Have your developer integrate w/ <a href="https://stripe.com/" rel="nofollow">stripe</a>, which will allow you to offer a seamless purchase experience while avoiding PCI compliance.</p>
