We are a small startup with a specialist IT software product. A well known company in our niche area has expressed an interest in working with us and to resell our products - possibly branded to them. What sort of margin would a reseller / distributor like this typically be given?

**From 20% to 40%**. It depends on your market and the position you hold in that market.

The more dominant you will be, the less margin you will give away.

30% is a fair margin to me. Propose 20% when you become famous.
