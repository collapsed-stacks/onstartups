Will there be any ego problems when founding CEO ( not necessarily CEO - any person who founded the company and now running it) has low educational qualification than his new employees?
What to do to avoid such ego problems? If those occurred how to solve them?

I always get the example of Dell founder, then Mr. Gates both of them left college in middle. Still they were successful. But did they never faced this ego problem?

In my case I will be hiring the first person for my company. Should I ask him in advance that if he is ok working with low educational qualification boss?

This sort of attitude is discriminatory - what the person brings to the table is more important than school, sex, creed, or orientation.  In my case, if someone asked me if I had a concern over the educational credentials of the CEO, I would take it as an organization that had a flawed sense of values and would decline to work with them.

It depends on person to person. This one is from my personal experience - I started my career with a firm where my boss is little lower than my educational background but I really neglected it and just try to push my best efforts into my work and for better prospects I followed these lines - `try try till you succeed` however another employee who joined but keep pointing the same what you mentioned in your concern still struggling in the same company due to his attitude.

For **CEO** - try to set an example and prove yourself.

For **employee**- try and learn to neglect such things because these things finally going to stuck your career path.

These people set examples and were very clear with the thoughts and implementation. Same punch line - `try try till you succeed` followed by these people :)

Just let him know what exactly you are willing to transform show him a better future with rock solid ideas and show your concern and care towards him. If you convince him with the ideas and your work transformation is on the right path with what you told him during the interview process, I believe NO employee will ever points you :)
