Will i get seed capital / angel investment for my venture if the capital that i am putting myself is zero? I mean my venture has a fund requirement of INR 2 Cr for the next 2 years, after which it will turn profitable. Will an investor be willing to fund it knowing fully well that i am not putting anything?

I don't see why you should be required to put in any money yourself at all. As a founder, you're required to put in *effort*, more than anything. Whether that be in the form of programming, design, or anything else depends on you and your startup, but in general I've never heard of an investment firm requiring founders to invest money in their own venture.

I will say this, however: If you have enough money to be able to fund your venture for a bit but haven't, that is something the investor might ask you about, just being curious why you didn't. That's a fair question and a valid concern on the investor's part.
