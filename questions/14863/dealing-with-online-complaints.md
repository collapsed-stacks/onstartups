The company I am working for has some complaints on the first page of Google. They have asked me to attempt to bump these off since they are untrue.  I realize this is not an easy task.  I was wondering if anyone has been dealt this hand and what steps would you take to rank higher on strictly your company name?  I have made some headway but I am curious to see how others might handle the same situation.  Thanks in advance!

In the case of Google rankings there are few things you need to do to get your site up in the rankings:

 1. Make sure your site is well written, if it is poorly written and just a couple of pages it is not going to rank high.
 2. Content is your best friend. If you have good quality and quantity of material on your site in regards to the keywords that are being searched you are going to rank higher.
 3. Linking. If you can get other sites to link to your site then this will increase your sites ranking.

Not knowing the full details it is hard to say, but if your site is essentially just a few pages of advertising for your product then it is hard to get it to the top.

If there are a few people out there writing negative words on high ranking community sites you are in a sticky situation.

In this case it's either one of two things:

 1. The person is lying. In this case you may want to contact the owner of the site and see if they are happy to remove the comments otherwise you may have to see what legal options you have available.
 2. The person is telling the truth. In this case you should contact the person and try and make amends. If you can give the person a positive experience after their initial bad experience, maybe they will be happy to remove the comments from the site.

I agree with xiaohouzi79, making sure you have good content, with solid keywords will help a lot. But something else to consider is getting your company onto other websites as well. Try expanding onto Twitter and Facebook and getting those as relevant search results. Another option might be to try and add a page to Wikipedia about your company or getting some friends to ask questions on Yahoo! Answers about your company. Sites like these might get to the front page and bump off the negative comments.

I also like the idea of making amends by responding to those negative comments with helpful feedback. People eat that up and it shows that you care about the quality of products/services you provide.
