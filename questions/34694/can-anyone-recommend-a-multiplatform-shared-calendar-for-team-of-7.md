I am looking for a shared calendar which works via Outlook, iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Web browser which will allow separate coloured entries for each user each person must be able to see each others or just their own schedule?

Does anyone know of any web apps which do this?

<p>Check out <a href="http://getflow.com/" rel="nofollow" title="Flow">flow!</a></p>

<p>It would be a little pricy for all 7 of you to have a copy, but I got my team set up on Flow when AppSumo had a deal, and its great. </p>

<p>You and your team can run the 14-day free trial and see if you like it. We only had it for a couple days when we decided to pull the trigger. </p>

<p>Great ability to delegate tasks and keep an eye on team progress. </p>
