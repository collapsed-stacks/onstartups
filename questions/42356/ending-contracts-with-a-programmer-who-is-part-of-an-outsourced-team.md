I hired a team of programmers through an outsourcing website to developer a web app.
The project is nearing completion, and I need to end some of contracts but keep the top performers working for a few more months. I'm a bit concerned about ending the contracts in this way, with concerns about IP, and morale amongst the ones who I want to continue employing. 

How can this staffing change be handled delicately and definitively?

Sounds like you did not let everyone know what the timeframe was for this project. 

Those you are keeping need to know you recognized their talents and the expectations are consistent. You don't want them to think they could be thrown off the project without any notice (Assuming they continue to perform.). They'll start looking for other projects before your's is complete.
