I launched a blog last week. I am looking to add some video blogs and I am looking for an inexpensive video camera that can output decent quality HD video, and reliable hosting for the site. Any suggestions?

Try Kodak's version of the Flip. It's around $200 and produces great HD video, has a nice view finder, and has a mic jack as well.  Drawbacks are the zoom is not very smooth and it can be touchy when shooting video inside.  If you want to jump up to a consumer level camera where you'll get great video and a better zoom try any of Canon's Vixia models.  All the video that we've done thus far is on the Kodak and we love it.  http://www.OperaPulse.com

Hope this was helpful!

Vimeo is the most reliable hosting site for video. They have very clear online tutorials, free and pro levels of membership, and great embedding.

Of course as the founder I'm biased, but you should use our WordPress hosting company: http://WPEngine.com.

As for dealing with large files and delivering quickly, just upload them to S3.  If you need a CDN (which you probably don't), something like MaxCDN can be configured in front of S3 for faster, world-wide delivery for a decent price.
