I have developed 2 electronics products and the manufacturer is in China.
I will sell them to some importers/distributors in many countries. Some of them will maybe sell my products with their own brand, some maybe with mine.

My question is, should I invest money to register a trade mark in EU and North America, or it's not necessary?

BTW, how to find customers when you are exporter? Contact many companies which could be interested in each targeted country by email first? Any better options?

Cheers 
GaÃ«tan

Hahaha. Bankrupt.

Ok, here we go:

* TRAVEL. You know. Email = spam, MOSTLY. Go to exhibitions, make yourself seen. Yes, costs money. Investmant. marketing is never cheap.

* Get agents. contact distributors. Get someone locally to grab some of your profits and do the groundwork. Many do that - try for example buying a SuperMicro Motherboard directly - you get pushed to a distributor.

For your final question you may like to try Alibaba.com. You can advertise your product there and let potential customers come to you (if they like your product that is).

If you are looking for Importers/Distributors, go to sites like:<br>
http://www.tradeboss.com<br>
http://www.tradekey.com<br>
http://www.wdtrade.com

If you want to sell under your own brand, it is not necessary to register a trademark, but it may make it better for you to fight product piracy. But a Trademark is only applicable for the registered business area, such as electronic devices. If someone is registering the same Trademark for Soaps, you will not be able to do something against it. That's why most small businesses don't register trademarks I guess.

Will that affect any relationships with current distributors? If the are selling your products under their own brand and spend their marketing funds to boost the sales why would you want to take over that expense? 

Simplified math would look something like:

10 distributors X $1000 marketing = $0 out of your pocket

...unless you can double the net revenue (+$10000) from own branding, then you're breaking even.
