Online, home-based company. Should I open a business bank account in WY or CA? Does this even matter?  What different things do I need to be considering when making this decision?

Now that we have interstate banking in the US, I think it really makes no difference where your bank has its headquarters. What matters are rates, services and convenience. You can easily find a bank with offices in both WY and CA if you like.
