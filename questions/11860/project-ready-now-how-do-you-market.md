I am a software developer and what I need now is some guidance as to the next steps that should be taken to get a 'finished' project off the ground. I don't need any financing, I just need some marketing. How do you even start spreading the word about it? Where would you spend money on ads? What steps would you take?

- Identify the type of customer who benefits from the offer.
- Get in touch with some of them and ask questions and listen.  (What would x need to do for you to be willing to buy it?)  (So if if it did x more would you be willing to spend more. etc..)
- Change the product so that the minimum set of features the customer is willing to buy is on the product.
- Communicate with the group you previously identified (Advertise) about your offer.
- Measure results and get feedback.
- Take feedback and go back to the change product step.  repeat.

We are software developers as well, and selling project time tracking software I got to say that being on page one on Google results is the best advertising. 
We spent some money on Google Adwords, but it didn't really work for us. 
What kind of software do you develop?

If you're aiming at smartphone users I would buy ad space in apps, smartphone blogs, etc. I would also contact industry bloggers and offer them an exclusive view of your product in exchange for a review on their site.
