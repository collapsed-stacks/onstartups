I have a habit of registering my own name on social sites, just to ensure that nobody impersonates me. Now, starting a business, I am doing the same with the business name and the product name:  
**Twitter account, Facebook page, Google+ page.**

So now I have these accounts. **What would a good strategy be to use social accounts - if at all?**

This ties into a bigger "online marketing strategy" that I don't (yet?) have, and I'm not sure whether it's worth to put a lot of effort into, as a 1-man niche business. Sure, Instagram probably has a very active Facebook page, but that's not true for every little niche product.

Level of social marketing is certainly specific to your product/service/industry; however, having a presence in all (including LinkedIn) can play an important role with search engines allowing consumers a general background/overview of your company.  It can also be a double-edged sword as inactivity can make your project look dated and out of touch.

You have the right idea Torben.

Now, all you need to do is put it all to use, along with a number of other additions of social media that you can utilize, all for free. It is essential that you track your results!
