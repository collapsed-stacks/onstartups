This is about starting elsewhere and not in the country one lives in. The reason is that there are countries that appear as a better starting place than the country I live in; livelier, more open community, more accepting -and matching- user profiles, location match -it is about a LBS.  

I am a non-EU citizen living in the EU. Considering EU only, I know that I am hence not allowed to start in another EU country other than the one I am living in. That said, I am not only concerned with EU; there are also countries out of EU that could be a good starting place.

You may ask what could be wrong with starting where I live; why should I struggle while growing when elsewhere is more accepting in every sense of the word? a startup from city X (in terms of connection "to and within" users and entrepreneurs) looks different from a startup from a renowned city. sorry, but this is it, right?  

I am inquiring about ways to circumvent this. What comes to mind are:

 1. start in your country and attract funding from the better matching countries. does a certain amount of capital enable it? or the prospect of advantages to the economy?
 2. do some countries in or out of Europe have a "welcome" policy for tech startups, thereby lowering the barriers? of course whether the place suits the project is the main question, but here I am curious to get general information of such places.
 3. referring back to (1), if I get financed from the funders of this other country right from the very start, can I found and start directly there?
 4. the project is by nature international. could this facilitate things to set up branches in other countries, say, within the EU?

Thank you very much for all your time and insights!

I can only say:

 - Your investors will want you be close to them (where they can see you)
 - You will want to be close to your first customers (travel expenses, support, face time)
 - You will want to be close to potential hires (where the talent is)
 - You will probably want your team together
