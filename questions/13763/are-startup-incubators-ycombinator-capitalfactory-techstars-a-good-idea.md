## Are startup incubators (YCombinator, CapitalFactory, TechStars) a good idea?

Most of us know by now about all the great programs and resources various startup accelerators or incubators offer. My question is, does it always makes sense to apply to one of these programs? is there a reason not to apply? and from the many options, does anyone have feedback based on personal experience?

These are the programs that I know about that are interesting to me:

 - [YCombinator][1] (for all the networking and buzz it generates).
 - [CapitalFactory][2] (because they are in Austin and it is run by great entrepreneurs from the area - I live in Austin, TX).
 - [Founder Institute][3] (I love Adeo Ressi' energy and brutal honesty when offering feedback to startups).
 - [TechStars][4] (they offer better food than YCombinator and an impressive list of mentors).

Do not apply if you have the following:

 1. You have an unlimited amount of money (or an already profitable, scalable and growing company)
 2. You are connected with several experienced angels and VCs
 3. You have an idea that is perfected and needs no iteration

Otherwise, in 99.9% of the cases you *should apply* and it will be well worth it.

I don't think it ALWAYS makes sense to use an incubator. It depends entirely on what your goals are. For instance, do you want to get VC finance eventually? Do you want to grow rapidly? Do you need access to resources or people you don't yet have? Do you want to run your business part-time while studying or working elsewhere? 

The answers to these types of questions will tell you whether incubators would be useful in your particular situation.

If you are very clear about what you want to achieve, then you will more easily be able to make a decision about which of these incubators, if any, would help you meet your goals.

<p>Hello fellow Austinite.  I would also suggest <a href="http://techranchaustin.com/" rel="nofollow">Tech Ranch Austin</a> as a good group to add to your list and would recommend them highly.  I met with Kevin and Jonas and got wonderful feedback on my ideas.  I ended up not following up on it, but a colleague is currently working with them (on Zehicle) and has nothing but good things to say about the community they have built.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend that you <a href="http://blog.fairsoftware.net/2010/08/20/what-they-eat-at-y-combinator-and-other-secrets-of-top-incubators-as-revealed-at-the-founder-conference2010/" rel="nofollow">watch this video from the Founder Conference</a>. What better to find out than ask entrepreneurs who have been through various incubators to share their experience?</p>

I think acceptance to one of these programs can provide great mentorship opportunities.

Don't do it for money. None of those is a good funding solution. If you need a quick access to $20K -- get a loan from a bank. The terms and rates are much better.

If you do not have resources and knowledge on how to go to the market then it's good idea. You will get lots of positive feedback and most of all - contacts. At the end of the day that's what really  matters.
