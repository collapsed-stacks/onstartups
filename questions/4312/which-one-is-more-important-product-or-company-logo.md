I want to create a logo by outsourcing it, but since I have little money in hand, I'm in the middle of deciding whether I should spend it for the product's logo or the company's logo. I would need to make a presentation as well to some investors therefore need to display the logo for my powerpoint slide. Besides for investors I also need the logo to build brand awareness amongst the community. From your experience which one is more important: product's logo or company's logo? And why?

<p>It depends on the type of company and the type of product. </p>

<p>If your product is something like a web site or iPhone application, then the product logo is more important, because people will see it way more often than your company logo. Think about 37signals - few people see their logo, but a ton of people see the logos of their products (Basecamp, Highrise, etc.).</p>

<p>If your product is something more like enterprise software, then the company logo is more important, since more people will see it on your business cards, proposals, presentations, etc. In fact, many companies like this don't even have logos for their individual products. My company is an <a href="http://www.bluefishgroup.com" rel="nofollow">enterprise content management consulting firm</a>, and while we do develop our own products, we've never really had to create individual logos for them. But we use our company logo a lot.</p>

<p>Not knowing your specific situation, I'll offer one piece of advice. Investors invest in companies, not in products, so if your primary use of the logo is to pitch investors, I'd go with the company logo.</p>

If you're asking this question, then you're probably not sure yet if your project is your product or your company (ie. is your company going to sell multiple products ? maybe not to start with ?). As such, I'd recommend to focus on the product if you can't pay for both.

In an ideal situation I would prefer you to use both company logo and a product logo but since are are low on budget therefore I would recommend you to go for company logo. The reason being that  I am a logo designer myself and I understand that a company logo design will portray your corporate identity. It will give your company a professional look. Your company at the moment might be dealing with one product only but if tomorrow you plan to expand your portfolio then that will fall under your company's brand umbrella. 

Give an image to your company and work in the corporate world via your company name. Once you have established your self and have the resources then get a product logo designed as well.

But if you think that all your dealings will be via your product name only and a company is just to show that you exist then do your product branding.

At this point of development I would recommended that you purchase a template logo ($25-30) as a holder until you are able to do the necessary market research to confirm your choice of names, positioning, and target market.


*A Note: It's the team*
With due respect to Michael whose answer on here I deeply respect -- investors invest in the team and the story. They want to know that your team can execute. They are presented hundreds and thousands of great ideas, with fancy logos and websites, they have seen the snap, the pop, and the crackle. They know that what separates the winners from the losers -- the team.

Is this an experienced team that will do what it takes to be successful. Will it take advice? Will it let go of concepts that are disprove in the market? Will they be willing to change track if the winds blow a new direction? Is this a team that will understand that our investment is from production and not consumption -- treating it with respectful dilligence?

***My Reccomendation:***
Go in and tell your story: The problem. The solution. The opportunity. The team. The ask. Don't worry about the logo.  Product, corporate or otherwise. 


Good Luck! Tell us how it goes.

<p>One can get a pretty good logo designed for $200 ish through services like <a href="http://99designs.com/" rel="nofollow">99designs</a>. Why not put your company and product logo requirements in a contest brief, add a few dollars ($300, perhaps) and see what comes of it? </p>
