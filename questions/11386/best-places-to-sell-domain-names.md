I have a domain name I would like to sell. What is the best bid auction site  for selling domain names? Is it OK to list it in different domain name bidding sites? I don't want to commit to selling it if I don't get a good price. I am aware of sedo.com.

for web 2.0 names, http://brandbucket.com seems like an interesting way to sell your domain.  I just signed one up; curious to see how it goes.
