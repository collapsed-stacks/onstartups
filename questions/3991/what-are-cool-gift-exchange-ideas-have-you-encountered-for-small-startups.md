Why go gift? Instead, take the team out for for a night they'll remember for a long time to come. Think crazy and team-building. One of my top picks is the gun range.

But if you're going to give gifts, I've found there are a few that fit well:

 * **personal electronics** - iPod, netbook, digital camera, etc... of course, the problem with these, everyone seems to have them already; so, if you go this route, then get them the latest and greatest gadget
 * **expensive edibles** - stuff no one in their right mind would buy otherwise; like those cookie arrangements, fancy nut mixtures, etc
 * **alcohol** - this is one of my favorites, and with [Your Gift LAbel](http://www.yourgiftlabel.com/) you can print custom label for a few good spirits

Instead of something material, why not turn it into a team-building experience?  Like paintball or Laser tag?  No one thinks to do those things over the holidays...
