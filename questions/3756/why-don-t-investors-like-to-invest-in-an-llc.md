I have read that if you are raising money, that an LLC is a dispreferred vehicle for your company.

Why do investors not like to invest in an LLC?

The main reason is the notion of preferred stock. Corporations have it, LLC's and S-Corps don't. VC's want preferred stock so they can:

1. Control the board by having the preferred stock control more of the company
2. Setup conditions that allow for favorable conversions for certain events and multiples. This has to do with getting their money out ahead of common stock.
3. Separate the different funding rounds (e.g. A, B, C).

LLC's also pass through losses every year (like a sole-proprietor) while the S-Corp has limitations on who can own them (e.g. corporations can't own S-Corps nor can foreigners).

You might want to compare the various structures available here:  http://www.themoneyalert.com/Corp-Entity-Table.html.  I would suspect that this difference is the one they aren't comfortable with:

Management Structure

**LLC:**

> Members can set up structure as they 
choose.


**S corp/C corp:**

> Shareholders elect  directors who 
> manage business  activities.

In short, they have templates for S & C-corps but LLCs require extensive definition ("operating agreements") because they are less implicitly structured.

As Jarie said, the main reason that LLCs are not preferred vehicles for raising capital is that many investors want "preferred stock," which will give them a leg up when the company goes public and all the private stock is converted to public common stock.

Basically, if a company wants to raise VC funding at any future stage, LLC is not the ideal entity type. Normally, startup businesses want to pass through losses in the first years of the business, so they choose an LLC or S Corporation. Then, when they want to get financing, they change to a C Corporation to issue preferred stock to investors.

While it is relatively simple to convert from an S Corporation to a C Corporation tax free, switching from an LLC to a C Corporation can trigger difficult tax issues that require an accountant if the business has bought and sold many assets. This makes LLCs a less optimal vehicle for passing through losses during the startup phase.
