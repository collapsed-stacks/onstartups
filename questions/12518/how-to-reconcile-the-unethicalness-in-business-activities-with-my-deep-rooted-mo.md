I want to be rich. But when it comes to do business, I find many people are cheating in business. If you don't cheat, you can't make a lot of money. I feel so sad. On the one hand, I don't want to cheat; on the other hand, I want to become rich. The business unethicalness is against my moral. If I press ahead, I think I will be half-hearted. How to justify the unethicalness in business activities? How to reconcile the unethicalness in business activities with my deep-rooted moral?

<p>Jack, opening 2 identical questions is uncool, it works against how this discussion platform was designed.</p>

<p>Assuming you are not a troll, you seem ... lethargic, sad, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/depression/DS00175/DSECTION=symptoms" rel="nofollow">possibly depressed</a>. I really think you should have a deep talk with your loved ones, and discuss seeing a psychiatrist.</p>

<p>Regarding your question; no, I generally don't see business people cheat around me. A very small minority do, and I have been unlucky enough to meet a real psychopath in my business life -- but it still remains a tiny minority who cheat.</p>

<p>There is a difference between selling and cheating. When you sell, you're allowed to focus on the good sides of your product, as long as you don't lie about or hide bad sides. It is very hard to say where the boundary lies between an acceptable and unacceptable level of selling the positives -- this comes with experience and empathy for the negotiation partner.</p>

<p>Generally, when you're dealing with private consumers and people who have no specific domain knowledge, then you have to be more plainspoken and tell everything. When you deal with industry professionals, you should more trust them to know what they're doing.</p>

I play Combat Arms, this is FPS game. I find this game to be some sort of model for the real business world. It seems that everybody cheats in the game to gain advantage,but it only seems. 

There are all sorts of people in game and in business. If you are approached by someone that do not play by rules, just avoid him, do not be provoked. Always stay on you moral foundations, whatever they are.
