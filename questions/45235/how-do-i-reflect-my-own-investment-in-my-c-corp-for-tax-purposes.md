I have a C-Corp I began, incorporated in 2012.  To bootstrap the business, I've invested $30K of my own funds into the business, and now as the calendar year (and fiscal calendar) draws to  a close, I am wondering how if at all I should reflect my investment for tax purposes.

For instance, can I write down any of this investment in 2012?
How should I structure my investment to best take advantage of tax benefits?

As you can tell, I am in the need of accounting expertise, but alas am bootstrapped hence my post to AOS!

I think it's usually done in the form of a loan. In this case you can only write down the interest (if any). Perhaps the best thing would be talking to a professional CPA - it should not be too expensive and the benefits might be quite substantial.
