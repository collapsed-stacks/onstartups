I wonder what is the typical, most often found, number of original founders of software startup ? I mean the number of people that come up with the idea not the one that put their money in it. 

The reason I ask is because I'm curious what works best for startup. People have different goals and ambitions which sometimes can colide. The larger the number of founders the more propable it is but on the other hand doing something alone is also hard. 

Another question is what is the size of original team that angel investors or seed funds are most likely to invest in ?
