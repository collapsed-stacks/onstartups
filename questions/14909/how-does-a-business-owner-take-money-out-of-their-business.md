Let's say I own a business selling widgets on the web. I'm incorporated, most likely an LLC. The business is doing really well and there is a lot of cash flow. Since I'm separated from the business by the LLC, how do I as the business owner reap the benefits of my successful online business? How do I take some of the profits out of the business?

<p>There are two main ways an LLC owner can obtain money from the LLC:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Withdrawals:</strong> This is money distributed to the LLC owners after net profits have been calculated. You need to show a profit to take a withdrawal from the LLC. How withdrawals are taxed depends on whether the LLC is taxed as a partnership or a corporation (see more on that below).</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed Payments:</strong> In essence this is a form of salary. Owners receive guaranteed payments in exchange for work performed, and it is done so before profits. Because guaranteed payments are distributed pre-profit they are treated as a business expense and can be deducted as such. Also, guaranteed payments are received by the owner regardless of whether the LLC turned a profit or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>These two methods have different tax implications, so speak to an attorney or accountant about these.</p>

<p>To make a point about Tim's comment, an LLC does not have to be a pass-through entity. An LLC can choose to be treated as a separate corporation for tax purposes. From the <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/article-29675.html">Nolo website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you will regularly need to keep a substantial amount of profits in your LLC (called "retained earnings"), you might benefit from electing corporate taxation. Any LLC can choose to be treated like a corporation for tax purposes by filing IRS Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, and checking the corporate tax treatment box on the form.</p>
