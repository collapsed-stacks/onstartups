I'm currently trying to decide if my startup should be an LLC or a Corp. (would probably make the S election for either case). This will be formed in Massachusettes, USA.

From what I've been reading online, it is easy with a C-Corp to make shares vest over time. But it looks like, to me at least, that an LLC needs to be owned by everybody at the start. You can't have a percentage and then vest.

Is this right?

Not so. It is true that an LLC issues interests as a percentage of 100%, but you can have people get membership interests vesting over time with concomitant dilution to the existing members. In fact, it's quite common.
