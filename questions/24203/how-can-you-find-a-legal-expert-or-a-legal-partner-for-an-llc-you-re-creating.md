How can you find a legal expert for an LLC you're creating? 

I'm in the Providence, Rhode Island region and am wondering where I should look to find legal experts so that I do not get fined or taxed for not knowing anything about the laws of an LLC.

Thanks

Try avvo.com - it's a Q&A site for lawyers and prospective clients. You can ask your question first and select whom to work with based on responses. You could also try linkedin Q&A or quora.

Andy, I am in the same area as you, I can refer you to a good lawyer if you are interested. Setting up a simple LLC should be pretty straightforward. â€“
