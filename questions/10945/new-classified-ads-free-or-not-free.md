I've develop a job portal with classified (Sell and Buy), due to the nature of spam or duplicate ads issue found in other popular classified sites - mocca.com by Mediacorp, should the ads still be free or a paid classified would control advertise from spamming post?

Would you mind to paid a low cost to advertise your services or items?

I think the traffic level and demography of your site is getting (and that you can prove) would be an indication of if you can charge or not.  Assuming you are from outside the States then you should answer your question about charging by looking at similar sites with similar characteristics. 

There are anti spam tools out there or as abenetis suggest you can write a script.

what about having your script check for double entries? You might even setup a function to block same advertisements from different users or even block IP-Addresses, if you know spammers are coming from a specific IP-Address.

For me it seems to be more a question of technical revision for your site. It might help if you charge a fee for ad postings, but only you could estimate to which extend you are loosing traffic and users.

However, low cost ads might be doing no harm to your site. Hope this helps.

I can't answer your direct question but what I can do is point you towards Kijiji.  They are a HUGE free classifieds site. They don't have any spam, at least none that I see. See how they do it.

I think have users sign up for an account is one way to minimize the spam.

If you have a large website with lots of people using it then you can make it a paid section.  If you are trying to grow it, go free.
