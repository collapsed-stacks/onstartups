I am planning to start my uISV business next summer. I am
out of US, and will start with one utility program for Windows.

In the moment I am exploring options for payment, and
am willing to consider all the alternatives out there.
However, some payment processors offer credit cards only, 
some offer phone, fax, mail orders etc. in addition. 

My questions are the following:

1. By your first hand experience, how important for me is to have
phone/fax/mail order as an option for my customers to purchase 
my product (small Windows utility program)? How many of your
selling activities are thru these XX century tools?

I hate to mix payment processors to cover all the possibilities, 
and would like to stay with one, (credit card) if possible, 
but if that's not the way ...


2. From your selling experience, which credit cards are most used 
in your International selling? How important is to have Diner's, 
Optima, Carte Bleue, JCB ... covered as an option for successfull selling?
I understand that the more the better, but if only 0-5% is from
this providers, than I can swollow that percent and go with
big US four (VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover).


Thanks in advance for your time and efforts answering these questions.

Have a nice day.

It depends slightly on the market for your product (individuals vs small business vs big business, etc) but in general simply supporting credit cards should be fine (in fact, I wouldn't even worry that much about amex/discover - visa & mc cover the bulk of the market).

For a cheap little program like yours, selling through a webshop that accepts major credit cards (and maybe paypal as well) should be all that it takes. Unless your program is to big for downloading, you (really!) want electronic delivery, to avoid the costs and hassle for shipping CDs etc. Phone orders and fax orders obviously don't play well with electronic delivery.

Over a 5 year period, I would say about 1-2% of my orders (for a C++ development library) were from a method other than credit cards. Most of those were not by phone or fax, but rather by wire transfer and almost all were from BRIC countries.

I would suggest going with whatever provider is easiest for you to set up (or whichever takes the lowest commission). If you get email from customers complaining that you don't take phone or fax orders it's easy enough to migrate to a provider who will do that.

Also, don't neglect the fact that, by default, you kind of already do take phone/fax orders. Just take them yourself using a US based Vonage phone number or something similar.
