I'm working on a business plan and estimating startup costs. I know the numbers vary wildly from enterprise to enterprise, but I'm trying to identify in my estimates how many people I would need to hire, and when. I am making some assumptions as best I can (e.g. one saleperson could sell (30) units per month) and I realize this is critical for VC's when determining how much capital we need and when. 

I can make some other assumptions about developers, and designers; but what about other functions? When do you hire a lawyer, for example, or an HR person? Who else am I missing? 

Social Media Manager
Lawyer
Accountant or Bookkeeper
Administrative Assistant(s)
Dedicated Marketing person

Are there any rules of thumb or guidelines? I don't want to look like a dunce for example if I say I need a lawyer before I need a social media manager, or that I'd want an Admin Assistant when I can do stuff myself.

No assistants, no lawyers, no HR.  Keep everything and I mean everything in two camps:  Producing the product and selling the product.  Tie it directly to revenue numbers.

Answer this question for potential investors:  "How much money do I need to get to [impressive number] of [users/sales] per year?"  Then add 33%.  

The rest is just a distraction that can be grouped into "professional services" and should be an insignificant portion of the budget.
