I'm a big fan of mechanical turk and often leverage it with smartsheet. I've used mturk for basic writing, gathering content from multiple sources, and some minimal research. However, I don't think I've truly tapped into its potential.

How do you use Mechanical Turk to crowdsource effectively? What are some of the biggest problems or challenges you have solved with Mechanical Turk? Or are there failures you'd like to share?

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.turkforce.com" rel="nofollow">TurkForce</a>.  Isaac Nichols was part of the original team at Amazon developing Mechanical Turk and now helps companies configure services that use it.  Plus, he's a great guy.</p>

<p>You should look into <a href="http://crowdflower.com/" rel="nofollow">Crowdflower</a>. They automatically determine the accuracy of workers and correct for bad workers, something that has always been difficult with Mechanical Turks.</p>

<p>You should also see the empirical evaluation of Mechanical Turk called "<a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~rion/papers/amt%5Femnlp08.pdf" rel="nofollow">Cheap and Fast - But is it Good? Evaluating Non-Expert Annotations for Natural Language Tasks</a>" by my colleague Rion Snow. There is a paper and easier to read <a href="http://blog.doloreslabs.com/2008/09/amt-fast-cheap-good-machine-learning/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>.</p>
