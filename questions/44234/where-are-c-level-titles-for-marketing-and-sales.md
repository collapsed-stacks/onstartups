I very often see these C-level titles: CEO, COO, CTO, CFO.

But what about marketing and sales? Are there any C-level titles for those roles?

I searched on Wikipedia and I found: CBDO (Chief Business Development Officer) and CCO (Chief Commercial Officer). I think they are the two which are most relevant. The fact is that was the first time I saw them. I most often see VP of Sales or VP of Marketing.

Why that distinction (C-level vs. VP)? Is there any practical consequence of such distinction?

<p>CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) or CSO (Chief Strategy Officer) may be want you are looking for. </p>

For sales one option could be 'Chief Revenue Officer' (CRO).
