I am working on my project full-time w/o income for a while, now it's getting to the end and I need someone with marketing experience to on board and help out, and a technical guy for final testing/polish, should they be considered as co-founders? I don't have budget to pay them at this moment. Or should I just dedicate a portion of equity to each of them for their hard works? both way, how much of percentage I should give them? they both have/keep their day time jobs

<p>Mainly I liked <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6949/forming-a-new-software-startup-how-do-i-allocate-ownership-fairly">Joel's approach</a> and, for me, the co-foundership is directly linked to the risk and value (resources, contacts, collaboration on the solution building) each person takes on the project.  </p>

<p>If someone adds value (regardless of the area or kind of resource) and is taking enough risk (you should reckon how much) he/she deserves to be your co-founder. But one point that may change your decision is:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Do you see yourself working closely with this person every day for many years?</li>
<li>Do you trust him/her?</li>
<li>Do you discuss/argue with this person constantly or frequently?</li>
<li>Do both of you have similar vision for the product and/or the project?</li>
<li>Do you complement him/her and your skills adds to his/her skills?</li>
</ul>
