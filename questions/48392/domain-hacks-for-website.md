I am trying to register a new domain for a software product website and thinking of using domain hacks. Something like http://del.icio.us or bit.ly or fold.it. In our case ending with **.it** or **.io**. But these extensions stands for Italy and British island and NOT sure any disadvantages of going with this approach.

Any feedback/recommendation?

Many thanks in advance.
