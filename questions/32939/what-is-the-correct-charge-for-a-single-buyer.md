We have a somewhat specific app/module that is requested by an enterprise so we don't know how much to charge, we are able to calculate the stimate of resources & time used, but being developers we have never charged (we are paid by hour normally).


 - So we have 1 product only sold to 1 enterprise, how much should be the profit based in that we can stimate the total production cost? 10% 50% 100% 300%?, also can you take care if the module/app is somewhat easy do develop versus a not easy task?

Charge as much as your customer will stand to pay.

This means you need to understand not what it cost you to create the system, but how much value the system delivers to your customer.
