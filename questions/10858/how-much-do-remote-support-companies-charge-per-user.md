I know this is a how long is a piece of string question but I'm looking to compete locally and assist small companies with their IT, usual stuff databases, Windows server etc. There are a few large "Remote support companies" around my area but they all want to send a sales guy. Does anyone have any ball park pricing for this sort of thing?

Thanks

One factor to narrow down the answer is answering the category of "user."

What I mean is:

* "Enterprise" customers typically charge $10k-$100k per customer and also designate 2-4 people at the customer who are allowed to talk to tech support.  This means it's really expensive "per user."
* B2B but non-enterprise is typically baked into the original purchase price, with an hourly rate for special needs or customization.  Hourly rates could be $100-$200/hour.
* B2C often has it baked in to the cost and it's impossible to charge extra for hourly rates.  There are exceptions; e.g. Microsoft charges even non-business customers for support but as far as I know, no one does that.

Hope this helps a little.  You could take this feedback and open another question with more detail too?
