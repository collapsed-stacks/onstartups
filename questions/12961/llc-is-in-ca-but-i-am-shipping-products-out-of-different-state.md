You may have to foreign register (some states call it foreign qualification) your current LLC in the other state. This is simpler than starting a new LLC in another state and also avoids complications over business ownership. Like John mentioned above, whether you do so depends on whether the state thinks you owe tax. However, it is legally REQUIRED that you foreign register (or create a new LLC) in the other state if you do business in that state (see below regarding substantial nexus). A lot of small companies are noncompliant in this regard and can get into trouble as a result.

>>In order to be taxed in a particular state, a business must have a “substantial nexus” to the state. This traditionally includes things like 1) Headquarters, 2) Employees, 3) Bank Accounts, 4) Servers, and 5) Return stores. If the company has one or any factor of these things, it is likely to have some “nexus” to the state so that the tax authorities might have to pay taxes there. No single factor is determinative, and each case must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

I'm no account no lawyer so seek that advice out before making any decision.  The potential complications are around taxes.  Obviously there if you have a propety there is already different property taxes and if you have employees you have different payroll taxes to make so the third thing to think about is sales taxes.  Most sales taxes have to do with have a physical location that sells the item for collection but I'm not sure if that is true for all the states.   Sales taxes are actually always (if the state has sales taxes for that category of good) applicable for each resident no matter where they buy from but the collection for the resident occurs for them when it is at a physical location and online if the business has a physicall location for selling their merchandise.  You do not though need to create another LLC for another location within the US.
