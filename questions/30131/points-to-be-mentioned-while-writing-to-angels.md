I am about to start writing to Angel investors about my project. Can anybody tell me what are the bullet points to be included while writing to Angels.

Should I follow any steps while writing to them?

1. The problem. (What it is, who experiences, and how big of a problem - in dollars - it is)
2. The solution (What you will you do and how it solves the problem)
3. The opportunity. (Size of market, percentage you will get, resulting value of the company)

Should be able to do that in three sentances or so. Through your ability to present simply you will be able to communicate your command on your business and market. 

So -- three paragprahs:
1. Your introduction and personal connection/link to them.
2. The P.S.O. (as above)
3. The ask (meeting, phone call, meet at the conference they are attending. . . . )

Remember these a busy people who will be scanning the letter not really reading it. They get hundreds of these. By keeping it short and simple you are respecting their time -- and maximizing the opportunity you will get a warm response when you follow up with a phone call.
