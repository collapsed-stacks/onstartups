I created a C-Corp a year ago thinking that I needed a company when I really never did. I haven't ever done anything with it and haven't heard about it since I created it. I want to shut it down to avoid ever having to deal with it. 

What is the fastest/easiest way to do this?

File the 1120 tax return marked as "final", similarly to the state if it requires tax returns, and whatever form the state you registered with requires to close the corporation. Some paperwork might be required to show that there are no outstanding liabilities.

Check the Secretary of State/Department of Corporations of the state where you're registered for detailed instructions.
