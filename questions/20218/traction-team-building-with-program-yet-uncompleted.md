To-date I'm self funding a new start-up.  I've hired two programmers who have helped me get the web-based program to about 85% completion.  At this point due to unexpected financial obligations on the personal front, I need to look at bringing in an investor (50k).  I know that traction and team are incredibly important.  How can I build traction with the program still incomplete?  How do I find a co-founder/build a team?

In short

 - You need a great angel to lure a great technical co-founder 
       
 - You need a great co-founder to get a great angel
        
 - You don't choose a co-founder, it just happens.

Not sure? DIY

   * Just hack something together that works as close approximation of your design

   * Make minimal viable product

   * get traction

   * Pimp it

Of course it's difficult to answer without knowing anything about your business. Generally speaking, **it's very hard to prove traction without a product or working prototype**.

If it's a B2B or B2C business, you could start presenting your prototype (or idea) to some companies to understand if they are interested in becoming beta customers. In that case, a few Letters Of Intent (of customers saying "I'm interested to try this product when it's ready") might prove to a potential investor that your product is interesting.

If it's a pure consumer product, I'm afraid there's no better way to show traction than having a product up and running. Someone could say that you might want to create a landing page presenting your product, and ask interested users to give their email address to be notified when the product is ready; honestly, unless your product is a niche software with no competition, I don't believe a few hundreds of email addresses can prove traction.

The best thing to do is to try to package the 85% you have in a prototype to be used only by a few, friendly beta users. And listen to their feedback. I've seen that users who love a new product often are the first to offer their suggestions and even help to improve it. At least that's what I do.

**"How can I build traction with the program still incomplete?"**

Basically, you can't, unless you have a history, pedigree and/or domain expertise you can sell to prospects. You have to have enough prototype to give people a solid feel for the products direction, appropriateness and useability. Establish an MVP (minimum viable product) and prototype that with representative web pages that use random data.

**"How do I find a co-founder/build a team?"**

By putting together a convincing business plan that will make people want to join, then selling it. Of course, this is obviously much harder than it seems.

To solve your incomplete issue have you considered offering your developers equity to complete the app?

Would bring you some technical partners. Dont assume its done, its never done. But that should allow you to prove it and then bring in more money.
