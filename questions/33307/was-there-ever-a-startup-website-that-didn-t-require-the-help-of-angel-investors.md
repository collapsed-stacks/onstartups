## Was there ever a startup website that didn't require the help of angel investors?

I guess what I meant to say is;

Has there ever been a startup that started small then became successful on its own, instead of having a large financial backup beforehand? If so, may I ask for a list of them?

Thank you!

UPDATE:
Thanks to [NetTecture][1], I have found out that angel investors aren't the very sole investors for a business but rather, they often become the startup's mentors in that they would give advice and provide initial financial support to get the startup ready for real investors.

7 startups that didn't take investing: GitHub, Red Sweater Software, Panic, Flying Meat, Pixelmator, Hamachi, Cocoatech. Also Microsoft and there really is plenty more.

I have collected more information about the 7 startups above at http://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/uISV-stories.html

Ok, reality checks:

* Angel investors do not provide a large budget. They provide a small budget to get something into a state to make a real investment offer and get "real" investors on board. 100.000 to 200.000 USD that an angel typically provides are small change for many business operations - seed money.

* Sure ther are. 37signals.com. The guy starting Minecraft. I think AngryBirds was also started without external money. Not real "websites" though but businesses based on a gain that use a website as a tool. Starting a website (financed by advertising) - ah, rarely these days. Crowded market and crappy income. Hard to sell to any investor.

As another note - you should have learned in school to properly word your questions. For example, lets asume it is totally impossible to make a successfull web startup without angel investor... the answer would STILL be yes, because, you can be sure with thousands of startups coming up.... there is one guy somewhere that did not have an angel investor and successed or failed (hey, you dont even say successfull startup - and yes, some grow then grow bankrupt, so they are still failures). So, the answer is so badly formulated it only allows yes as an answer.
