## Inventory stacking in other countries

Let's say I am based in US, and I want to sell gadgets in UK via online store. 

Due to shipping cost consideration, I would like to ship the gadgets to a UK location ( somewhere like a small "warehouse") first, and then only then I ship the gadgets from the warehouse to each buyers. The size of one batch of shipment would not occupy too large a space ( maybe a box of 0.5m*0.5m*0.5m), and if I had a relative at UK, I could just easily get her to be my warehouse and handle all the local shipping stuff.

The problem is that I don't have anyone in UK, and so I am looking at if there are some third party warehouses that handle this for me? I know about [Virtual Office][1], but I am just not too sure whether Virtual Office covers this kind of warehouse inventory outsourcing or not.

<p>What you're looking for are "Fulfilment Services".</p>

<p>Typically</p>

<ul>
<li>You (or your suppliers) send products to their warehouse </li>
<li>They store them </li>
<li>When customer places an order you send info to them </li>
<li>They pick,pack and deliver</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits/" rel="nofollow">Amazon do this</a> - but there are <em>lots</em> of other suppliers, some targeting niches like small players, fresh produce etc and many that won't even bother talking to you for small volumes.</p>
