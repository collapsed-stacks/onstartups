**I wonder if publishing a NO-refund policy will prevent the chargeback?**

As a business, we'll show it where the customers can see it -- on the website and include in emails invoices and sales receipts. By taking these actions, we demonstrate that we have taken measures so customers are well informed that we do NOT offer refunds after purchases have been made.

Is that enough to avoid a chargeback?

Now ofcourse, before anyone says it, we do not intend to cheat the customer with this policy in place, its just that we're basically a service provider who collects payment on behalf of the client from the customer (who paid the charge). Although we verify client details (phone, address etc..) and run occasional checks but just in case the client is unable to deliver the product/service for some reason, we don't want to be liable for the chargeback and the associated costs.

If not this, is there any other better way to deal with the situation? What do you do? Just absorb the charge and ban the client? Thats obvious, but what if you have more than one such client?

Edited to add:

What if we: 

1. Inform the user a few days before the charge (so they can't claim it was surprise). 
2. Charge at the END of the month when the customer has already consumed the service (so they can't possibly argue it was "not as described").
3. Provide option to instantly unsubscribe prorated (so they can't argue that they couldn't opt out when they wanted) 

... I hope then we can win most chargebacks?

Thanks

<p>If you are in the United States, or any other country with similar laws, your terms will have <strong>no</strong> effect on chargebacks. The US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargeback" rel="nofollow"><strong>Truth in Lending Act</strong></a> governs all credit card transactions. In addition, if the credit card is not physically present at the time the transaction is made, other rules apply. Since the credit card is not physically present in most internet transactions, the stricter rules normally apply. To summarize them in simple English, if the consumer disputes the charge <em>(card not present)</em> the issuing bank must side with the consumer over the merchant, unless the merchant can prove what the consumer says is false. All your customer has to do is state you software or service doesn't work, or they never received it and you lose the case.</p>

<p>If you are in the US, nothing you do trumps the <a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0219-fair-credit-billing" rel="nofollow">Fair Credit Billing Act</a> of 1975. Take a look at the law and note that if your terms don't follow the law, your terms have no meaning.</p>

You don't specify what you're selling, so I'll be general:

In my e-commerce experience, any time you gird yourself for battle with you customers over money, you are setting yourself (and your customers) up for pain.  Not only are these practices hard to enforce and win, they can easily scare off potential customers, lower your conversion rates, and eat up your time and energy.  People hate seeing asterisks and fine-print. 

... Even with a well-published no-refund policy, what if your customer simply told their bank "I never received the goods or services promised"?

Yes, its a good idea to prevent chargebacks.

See: http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/chargeback-management-guidelines-for-visa-merchants.pdf

> [...] Visa will support your policies, provided they are clearly
> disclosed to cardholders before the completion of a transaction.
> 
>  Your website must communicate its refund policy to the cardholder and
> require 
>     the cardholder to select a “click-to-accept” or other affirmative button to 
>     acknowledge the policy . The terms and conditions of the purchase must be 
>     displayed on the same screen view as the checkout screen that presents the 
>     total purchase amount, or within the sequence of website pages the cardholder 
>     accesses during the checkout process

Edited to add: 

Mastercard also states the same: http://www.mastercard.com/us/merchant/pdf/BM-Entire_Manual_public.pdf

>In the event of a dispute, and subject to compliance with other Standards,
>such specific terms shall be given effect, provided that such specific terms
>were disclosed to and accepted by the Cardholder before completion of the
>Transaction.

**Edit #2**:

Although Google says different: https://support.google.com/checkout/sell/bin/answer.py?hl=en&hlrm=en&answer=165604

> The Fair Credit Billing Act protects customers' rights to dispute
> charges for a number of accepted reasons. Generally, a policy that
> allows no refunds will not be upheld by the credit card associations.
> 
> As a best practice, make your business policies visible to buyers
> before they place an order. The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA)
> entitles buyers to issue chargebacks regardless of a merchant's
> business policies. However, if there's evidence that the buyer had the
> option to view your policies before placing the order, your chance of
