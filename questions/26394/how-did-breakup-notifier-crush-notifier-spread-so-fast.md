Breakup Notifier was a huge hit within three days, after which it got banned by Facebook. I understand that Crush Notifier got a push with the buzz generated for Breakup Notifier, but what was their marketing strategy for both of them?

How did they make them viral so quickly? Does that require being featured on a big site, or just catching up with usual user attention?

I'm sure it's just because the apps were so interesting from a human perspective that when people heard about them, they immediately told their friends. Everybody has relationships, everybody has experienced unrequited love, and everybody could immediately understand how these apps might be interesting to them. When things are novel and interesting, they spread like crazy.
