## Instead of finding a technical cofounder, can I just make a "hacker collective?"

<p>I recently had the thought that instead of trying to find a cofounder or two, and promising them inexact amounts of equity (we never hear of 23.61% cofounder equity), I could instead just leverage an entire <em>community</em> of programmers.</p>

<p>For the people accepted into this "collective," they'd get equity according to whatever they contributed to the project. We'd measure this with GitHub, and the ideas would be tracked in a similar way (agreed-upon Excel.)</p>

<p>I also think this would be a really interesting way for a group to work on <strong>several projects at once</strong>. They'd all have a shared plan/vision for the future, and they'd also understand that equity changes with how much work they actually put in. </p>

<p>When it comes time to get outside investment for one of the projects, we'd treat the collective as a single entity. If say, Paul Graham invests $xx for say, 7% equity, the collective goes to 93% equity (and all shares are obviously lessened in proportion.)</p>

<p>I know accelerators, say, don't like 4+ cofounders, but that's why the collective operates as one entity.</p>

<p>I'm curious, if anyone might see any legal missteps this might entail? Also I'm concerned about what outside investors might think, having a seemingly uncommon way of managing projects and cofounders. </p>

<p>This collective would be better defined as an entity of contractors rather than cofounders. Cofounders are supposed to go above and beyond all others.</p>

<p>I like to think you would still need a dedicated cofounder to bounce ideas and fill knowledge gaps regarding your workforce collective.</p>

<p>As a startup you will have to pivot your idea- in this case pivot your collective. Its tough to do this alone.</p>

<p>What you are referring to is a "grunt fund" - as defined by <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/users/17640/mike-moyer">Mike Moyer</a> in his book, <a href="http://www.slicingpie.com/slicing-pie-a-guide-to-dividing-up-early-stage-startup-equity/" rel="nofollow">slicing pie</a>.  Each participant can be awarded equity based on what they bring to the table - be it funds, expertise, or hourly efforts.  </p>
