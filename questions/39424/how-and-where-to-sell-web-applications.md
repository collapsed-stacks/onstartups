I have couple of good quality web applications. Personally I never got time to market them. I am just a web enthusiast who love to make web products.

Is there any good market place other than Flippa where you can put up the products for sale ? At Flippa people are more interested in buying running businesses with proof of revenue. In my case, I don't have revenue but the product themselves are really of good quality. With a little marketing, it can generate good income.

If what you say is true, why don't you do "a little marketing", then sit back and enjoy the "good income"?

The problem is, of course, that without a proven track record, it is very hard to value, so hard to sell.

Writing an app doesn't make you an entrepreneur. All you have is some apps - they are not businesses to sell. You have very little chance of selling your apps unless you have also created a business model and validated it in the market, with some customers and a clear concept of how you will make money from it.

Take some time to learn these skills and then you will have a full tool box both to create apps and to create businesses.
