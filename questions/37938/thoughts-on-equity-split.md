I'd appreciate your thoughts on this situation:

I am a developer that has worked on a on 2 products for the past 4 years.  Product 1 has been somewhat successful capturing a small niche market, and lifestyle business size revenue.  Product 2 seeks to capture a much larger/mature market segment.  Product 2 is a fairly large (in terms of feature set) SaaS type product.  I've been able to acquire 4 customers since the product was released late last year, but the recurring revenue is very small at this point.  However, there is a lot of interest and promise in this market.    

In order to grow the business, I believe I need a partner/co-founder.  I had looked last year for a co-founder, but never found one and just kept focusing on the product.  Earlier this year, I started working with someone, who has helped on the Sales/Marketing side.  She has been able to get more meetings/demos with potential customers, although we have not signed a new customer yet - but things look good.  She has expressed a desire to come on full time as co-founder.  

I can provide more details if necessary, but based on this info, what would you say the split should be?
