We are considering running a competition to promote the use of our website.  We run a directory style site full of acting talent.  We want to promote to advertising agencies and encourage them to hire our talent.  Our concept is to run a competition, giving away a holiday as a prize, to the person who hires the most amount of talent.  

Has anyone here run a competition like this?  Any tips or advice on how worthwhile they are?

When I was in the Auto Business we ran a 3 month promotion to give away a car.  It was worthwhile because it generated a lot of buzz, and credit apps.  Promotions in general are a very good return on your investment.

Where it gets complicated is complying with your state lottery and raffle laws.  Make sure you seek the correct legal advice for your "fine print"

I would say it would be worthwhile if you encouraged people to go to your site and enter their email addresses to be included in the competition.  That way, you can grow your email list for the future.  You should also promote it on Facebook and encourage people to "like" and "share" the competition to boost your brand.  It's great PR.
