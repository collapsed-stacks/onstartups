We are about to launch a Website Builder product(Allows anyone to create a website with a few clicks and without any programming or Photoshop knowledge).

Regarding Affiliate Marketing - what do you think is the best way to reach affiliates?

By creating our own affiliate network(Writing to each potential affiliate, closing affiliate agreement and putting banner ads) or by using affiliate networks? Or both?

I would be happy to hear what is the expected output of Affiliate Networks(how many impressions will our banners see, in what time?)

Thanks

I would say any action is better than no action. 

In either case "it depends" is a relevant answer. It depends on your price point as well as your market, projections, affiliate commission and more. 

I would advise you to create a survey with surveymonkey and take the time to contact affiliates one at a time and build up a feedback of 100 active affiliates. In this survey ask them what they want and what they dont want. This will give you more than enough information to make a informed decision. 

Note that this will be relevant and realistic information. 

Good luck with your new venture.
