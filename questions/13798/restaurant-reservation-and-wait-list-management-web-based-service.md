I need a little help here I have approached few restaurants in my area (India) and most of them told me it's good but most of them don't have access to internet in their restaurants..

Would like to inform you that I am in talks with poptates in India and they liked my idea but like you said they don't have access to internet so I have made a presentation to make them understand how this idea works, However i'd like to know whom should I approach for website development freelancers or small time web designing company.

I am not sure about how to form a company?? will a proprietary firm help me get funding from investors at a later stage or I need to form an LLP in India.

Need your advice .....

Thanks,
Nimesh

I'm not Barghev, but I'll respond anyway.

I wouldn't bother going ahead with any development at all if none of the restaurants that you talked to have internet access.  What is the point of making something a product that your customer can't use?  Maybe keep looking for some restaurants that do have internet access and then move ahead with development.

I'll be of no help on the rest of your question as I have no idea how the law re: company formation works in India.
