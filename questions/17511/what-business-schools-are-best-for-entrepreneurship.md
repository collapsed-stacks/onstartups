<p>I strongly recommend <a href="http://babson.edu" rel="nofollow" title="Babson College">Babson College</a> in Wellesley, MA. There's a reason it's been ranked the #1 school for entrepreneurship (both undergrad and graduate, in multiple rankings) for nearly 20 straight years.</p>

According to Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, and according to other people I've talked to, people go to schools like Harvard or MIT in large part because of the networks they can build there.

In Paul Graham's opinion, the best places to start startups are Silicon Valley and Boston, in that order.

If your end goal is to get a good academic experience, I realize I'm not really answering your question, but if your question is "What school will maximize my chance of business success?" you might want to read what Paul Graham has to say about it.

<p>I've found from my research that smaller schools tend to be better for entrepreneurs. There is a great program at <a href="http://www.weber.edu/Majors/busadministration.html" rel="nofollow">Weber St</a>. (in Utah).</p>

<p>But there's also something to be said for the school of hard knocks. Not to say that education doesn't help, but applying that education in real world situations is <em>key</em>.</p>

This is a bit off subject, but I may be valuable.
An important fact is you dont ever interview yourself to work for yourself.
Therefore what you know is more important than where you learned that knowledge. 

You can also look outside formal education.  Working for a small business and getting involved in the daily details such as payroll, property leases, agreements, employee politics, motivation, leadership, management, can yield great value.

I got my experience in the Car Business giving me exposure both to small business, high profit demands, competition, marketing, and most of all SALES.

Might consider doing some time working for a small business where you can take a lead role.  Instead of paying for tuition you may get a decent wage.  

If you decide to go the Book route, you can probably read 2 books a week on business, and learn a lot more in your own den then in a classroom with an idiot sitting in the back, asking questions, and slowing down your class.  School is great for making contacts, but look at your other options as well.

Stanford Graduate School of Business. 
http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/12/pf/jobs/harvard_stanford_entrepreneurs.fortune/index.htm

"As a percentage, more Stanford grads (about 15%) are likely to either start companies or immediately work for startups than Harvard grads. Indeed, nearly 10% of Stanford's graduating class launch companies right out of school, versus about 4% to 6% at Harvard -- numbers significantly lower than during the 1999 dot-com-era boom."


Btw, there are some excellent entrepreneurship videos and resources at http://ecorner.stanford.edu
