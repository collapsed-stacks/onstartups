I'm a freelancer who is trying to transition toward a heading a small consultancy for the first time.  I'm doing this so that I can focus on using my high-value skills to solve interesting problems for clients, hire out the technical grunt work to commodity programmers, and grow a brand that handles more and better clients than I could handle working alone.

About 6 months ago, I decided on a good company name composed of two English words, registered it as a .com domain, put up a business-card style page, made myself an email address, and got myself a phone number.  All of this is officially under my legal name, not a company name.

Then I noticed that I have a doppleganger: another person who runs a small consultancy doing similar work with a nearly-identical company name (My Company Name + "& Business") and a domain name that is the same as mine but with a hyphen between the words.  The whois record says they registered the domain a couple years earlier.  Don't ask me why they chose the hyphenated version and NOT the unhyphenated.  Their website says they are located in the same country as me but far from my local market.  I am, however, interested in eventually doing business globally under my brand.

Question: Should I worry and hurry to rebrand my business with a different name? What if any problems might arise if I stick with what I have?

What problems might arise?

Legal problems...infringement of a trademark, unfair competition, or cybersquatting, depending on the facts.
