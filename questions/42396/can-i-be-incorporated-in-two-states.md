I am currently incorporated in NC and am expanding my business to NY.  Can I operate in NY with my NC incorporation? Or must I form a new corporation in NY?  Can I possibly just use a DBA in NY?

<p>You need to <a href="http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/buscorp.html#appauth" rel="nofollow">register (apply for authority)</a> your NC business in NY as a "foreign" entity.</p>

Yes, in most states you just register as "foreign" corporation and pay the fees. Just make sure you understand what is that threshold when you actually have to do it. It varies state to state.
