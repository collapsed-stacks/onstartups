## How to find users of my extra credit card charging capacity, for business expenses?

Does anyone know of a way to find small businesses who need credit card charging capacity, but don't have it?  For example, it's difficult for some LLCs to get business credit cards.

For several years, I've placed all of the business expenses for my company on my personal credit cards.  It's been several hundred thousand dollars per month, and I am reimbursed for everything and pay everything in full.  Unfortunately the business is now reworking things, and so there go all of the rewards points that I was getting- several million per year- which I really needed, as I do a ton of personal travel.

I'm seeking another business that doesn't have its own credit card and needs or prefers to use someone else's?  I am fine with taking the risk and I have looked into the legality of this, and it's fine.  I would expect that all charges would be prepaid or I'd have a security interest in assets.

Thanks.
