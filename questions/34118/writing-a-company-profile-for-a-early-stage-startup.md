Some key aspects include:

1] Writing the product desciption (obvious).<br/>
2] Describing unique features of the product.<br/>
3] Adding some personality to writing.<br/>
4] Describing use cases for the product.<br/>
5] Writing about the company's founders.<br/>
6] Avoid marketing-speak to make your idea sound more exciting <br/>

I want to know what is the standard template? How many more points do I need to consider while writing the company profile?

And is the company profile enough to pitch? or Do I need an Executive Summary?<br/>
Or Am I completely off track here?

Thanks for clarifying, I have only experience with pitches in person where time is the key component in in-person pitches. Thus, I would merge some items: product description with 1 or 2 clear use cases. There is a reasonable book out there: http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/

Particularly he points out a checklist focusing on telling a story.
The most important concepts perhaps are: Concise & Clear & Consistent

I also like a lot a book Presenting to Win:The art of telling your story by Jerry Weissman. He makes emphasis on how you should develop your story, your pitch about your product.

Hope it helps,
