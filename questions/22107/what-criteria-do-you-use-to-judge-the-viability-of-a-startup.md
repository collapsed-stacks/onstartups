I'm currently building an evaluation grid to help me pick my next venture from my list

I would like to get more criteria to complete it.

Criteria can be both objective and subjective. I prefer subjective ones.

One of the subjective criterion I have is "`Will I use the product personally?`" which is an important criterion for me.

I have added the following three criteria that seems to be very common requirement for some VC:

- Can the business be mostly automated?
- Is the product subscription based?
- Is the customer base large and paying a small amount per customer (rather than having few customers paying a lot)?

**What are the most important criteria I should add in the grid?**

Here are the 3 questions I ask myself before considering seriously a startup:

 1. How **PAINFUL** is the problem being solved ? 
 2. How **BIG** is the Target market ?
 3. How **REALISTIC** is the revenue model ?

Atleast, those are the MAIN ones i'm interested in.

Quick background: I have founded 5 companies, one of them was acquired, one merged, one failed, one just reached commercialization and raised the fourth round of VC and I'm in the process of raising a seed round for my next venture. This will be the fourth company I've founded with venture funding. 

Here is my experience, "Team" and "execution" are kind of a given when you evaluate ideas, but when you look at an idea, strip it away from the team and everything else so you can size it up without being distracted by passion and emotion from the founders. I think it's an overused fallacy that VC's invest only in great teams. VC's know that sometimes all they need is a team that is "good enough" to build a product so they can replace the team with a more experienced one when (and if) necessary. Statistically (according NVCA) 80% of VC-backed CEO's are replaced by a VC-appointed CEO at some point. It's not a stretch to say that many VC's fully expect to replace the founders at some point. My point is that I think the idea itself is much more important than many folks admit. I often read things like, "everyone has great ideas, it's the team that matters". That's just plain wrong. Great ideas are rare, as are great teams. 

As for evaluating the actual business model, I use three things: 1) a "strategic control" scale to help me size up the potential of every idea I consider, 2) I look for ideas that overlap with, dovetail, or threaten competing businesses or business models, 3) I look for business models that will allow me (the founder) to create an irrational relationship between earning potential and valuation. I like revenue models that are really simple, but I don't care if a company can reach profitability in the first five years. It doesn't have to if you have a clear exit strategy and you can get sufficient momentum with customers. 

The strategic control scale works like this: the very best business concepts will give the company the absolute highest amount of strategic control in a marketplace. Strategic control gives companies the ability to protect their revenue, customers and profit from the competition. On the other hand, bad ideas provide no strategic control at all. Here it is in a nutshell, with 10 being the highest amount of strategic control:

9/10 - Can we develop a platform and/or own the standard for something? This is the highest amount of control. A platform always beats an "app". The iPod is a brilliant product, but the App Store is a platform that gives the iPod strategic control. Facebook is a platform, Twitter is a platform, MySpace is (was) an app. Would you rather own the app or the app store? 

8 - Control the value chain

7 - Own customer/distributor relationships

6 - Brand

5 - Two year development lead

4 - one year development lead (a development lead alone is very superficial) 

3 - Selling a commodity at a cost advantage

2 - Selling a commodity at cost parity

1 - Selling a commodity at a cost disadvantage

Keep in mind that many companies use a combination of several of these points at once to exert strategic control, so it's not necessary for a concept to have a 10 to be successful.

By the way, there is a big difference between "sketching out a business model", as with the business model canvas, and determining the viability and potential of a concept. You're not looking for a checklist of things that need to be accomplished when you start a business, you're looking for a way to decide whether or not to invest time, money and energy in something.

I like your criteria, but I do think you're missing one critical aspect:

How well can the founders execute? 
Have they demonstrated an ability to execute in this field?
and
(very important)
Can the founders identify what they need to do, beyond the obvious?
and
(most important)
Can the founders quickly go from "I need to do X but I don't know how" to "I now know how to do X and I will dominate it."

Knowing what you're missing and being able to master something you have no idea how to do are the two most important attributes of a startup founder. 

ie
Make SURE the guys running the show are solid.

Here is my checklist:

Product Idea Checklist

    * Minimum viable product
          o what is the simplest version of this idea?
          o can version 1 be developed in 1 month?
          o can you do less? can you accomplish things by subtracting rather than adding?
          o can the biz model be simplified?
    * Customer & Market Research
          o Compete with non-consumption
          o what is the market size
          o if you are competing on price, or have a lower margin, do you have cost advantages in your business model that competitors do not
          o will version 1 be beneficial to customers?
          o are the biggest competitors in the market focusing on other areas
    * Strength & Weakness
          o do you have an unfair advantage?
          o is this a product you will use yourself?
    * Product Vision
          o what problem are you solving?
          o why is it important to solve this problem?
          o what is the pain this product resolves?
          o what makes your product different
          o can you describe what you are going to make as a generative metaphor
                + It's eBay for jobs.
                + it's like Wikipedia, but within an organization. 
    * Dependencies
          o What external events are the products success dependent on?
          o How will you measure the external event?
          o What happens if the external event doesn't happen?
    * Planning
          o Pre Mortem: Imagine the project has failed horribly : “What could have caused this?”
          o what thinking can be done upfront - thinking is faster than programming
          o Chicken & Egg problem - does the value of this product require it already have traction?

If I had to condense it I would go with:

 - do you have an unfair advantage?
 - what is the simplest version of this idea

I would probably start with a SWOT analysis of each idea. Seriously! 

There are a million things to think about. I think a big one to add to the list right off the bat is, what does the sales cycle look like and what is your anticipated effort per sale. Is there a point of no return where sales start driving themselves?

*The main problems of growing a startup are finding the motivation, the right advisors, the right coworkers and the right customers. If you can't solve these four problems before starting up, they will bite you later, when you are too busy with many other things.*

In bullets points:

 - Am I **passionate** enough about the topic to be able to dedicate all my time for the next 1-2 years to it?
 - Do I know or can easily get access to **2-3 high profile people who can advise** me on how to succeed in my target market? I talk about people like "been there, done that", not the self-proclaimed business consultants that pollutes startup forums :)
 - **Can I convince right now 1-2 great people to work with me** on the project for equities only (no salary)?
 - Even without those advisors, can I **easily set up NOW meetings with 5-10** potential customers? In other word, no more "build it, buyers will come" for me!

A corollary to having a large user base who pay small amounts is a small user base who will pay large amounts. For example, a enterprise-service company, serving a small number of clients (Fortune 1000 companies, perhaps), but these clients can pay a lot of money for a service or product they think will benefit. Clearwater Analytics is a great example of this kind of model.

I always ask myself three questions:

 - What customer pain can I solve profitability?
 - Would I do this for free?
 - What's my strategic advantage against competitors?

If I don't have good answers for these three questions, it's not worth it for me.

All those other criteria like how big is the market? or can the team pull this off? or will it get funded? are all fine but without getting past your internal doubts, you will never get to a place where it's even a viable idea for funding.

A few of mine:

Is this an enterprise or consumer-focused application? For me, everything that I dislike about business is wrapped up in enterprise applications. Why? The long sales cycle (in my experience, it's a year minimum from first handshake to signature-on-contract) requires external investment, and for me, investors == anxiety, compromise and lack of control.

Is there a clear plan to generate revenue? If the founders don't have a clear plan to make money, they don't know what they are doing. If they are planning to gain market share and figure out the money later, they didn't learn a damned thing from the last bubble.

Do the founders have an exit strategy? If they do, then I'm skeptical. I want to work for people who are building a business that they love and wouldn't want to leave. If they are planning on doing it just to rake in a big payday, they are less likely to act in my best interests.

I have around 90 ideas for ventures myself, which I update regularly. When considering ideas I use the following questions:

Since you are not considering this as a VC, but yourself I would consider whether there is a realistic exit strategy. Can you exit even if you only partially succeeded and grew tired quickly?

I would also consider the idea in relation to the expected cash flow. I really do not want to end up in a situation where I am financing an idea myself and have bitten over something too big to finish version 1.

Is the general field of the ventue interesting and in growth? This means that if your venture fails after three years, you would not be in a dead end with lots of knowledge in an obsolete field.

Is it patentable or are there likely to be patents already on the idea?
