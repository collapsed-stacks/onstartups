I currently have a simple form for customer feedback / customer issues, this form send an email to support@ourwebsite.com and then we check that and reply to any inquiries.

I'd like to implement a proper ticketing system where a ticket is opened for each issue, and replies can be done via email or via a form (that displays all previous replies), etc.

Does anybody know of such a beast ?

I think the thing you need is TRAC.

Their own site is the best demo of their tools, since it is actually rendered by it !
http://trac.edgewall.org/

It provides a ticketing system, a wiki, can be linked to SVN and has a lot of plugin/extension

We use at in my company and are very happy with it

The type of software you're describing sounds like Customer Relationship Management (CRM). I often use Freshmeat to browse for Free, Open Source Software (F/OSS). You can find all the F/OSS tagged as CRM, sorted by popularity, by following this link:

http://freshmeat.net/tags/crm?sort=popularity&with=&without=

There are currently 69 CRM projects listed there!

DISCLAIMER: I've developed proprietary CRM s/w before, but I've never used any of these F/OSS CRM projects, so I can't vouch for any of them. However, this list should provide a good starting point for your search and evaluation. Good luck!
