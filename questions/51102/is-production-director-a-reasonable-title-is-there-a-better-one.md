<p>We will have three directors in a small UK software company:</p>

<ol>
<li>Managing Director - builds business links and manages projects</li>
<li>Technical Director - our senior architect and sys admin</li>
<li>? - senior developer and manager of the development team - makes sure products get out on time</li>
</ol>

<p>What's the most suitable title for the third role? Is "Production Director" a reasonable title? Is there a better one? </p>

<p>Nowadays, the titles are almost "meaningless" - you and companies in general can chose whatever. Even create new titles. </p>

<p><strong>So as far as it reflects +/- the content and it is understandable by the stakeholders, it doesn't really matter.</strong></p>

<p>In you case (as you want to have "director" in it), what about <strong>"Operational Director"</strong>? The "Production Director" is IMHO more appropriate to some manufacturing company (with a "real" tangible product)...</p>
