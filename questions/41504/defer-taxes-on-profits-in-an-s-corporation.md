If you wish to do this then you should consider C-corp status.  

The simple answer to your question is, "No", but it looks like you are looking for more detailed ways to play games with revenue, etc.  (based on the comment(s) you have for other response(s).)

You need the help of an accountant and/or attorney.  You should probably get professional help for this question.

Generally no. The S-Corp earnings flow to the owners, and the owners are the ones who pay taxes on it. The income is taxed when earned, according to the corporation accounting method.

Our clients have used a structured sale, which is based on IRC 453.  It allows deferred installment sale treatment.  So you can defer the tax obligation into the future while earning interest based on your risk tolerance.  Feel free to contact me with any further questions.
