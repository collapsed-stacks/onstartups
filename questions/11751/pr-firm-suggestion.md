I am part of a startup that offers accommodations across the world. We are hoping to hire a PR firm that has experience with startups (and knows digital marketing clearly). 

Does anybody have suggestions of a good one to speak with? 

Jim

P.S. If we end up engaging this firm theres a bounty for ya!

Assuming you can afford a PR agency (say $8K/month for 6 months minimum), here's a simple way to find the one for your space (you seem to be in the travel space). Look up your competitors and similar businesses. Find their press releases. 

Write down the names of the PR agents mentioned at the end. Repeat for a while. Notice a trend? Call the one you identified and talk to them.

Then think again and make your decision.

In the past we've engaged with PointBlank. The contact there is Aaron Wessels.
They're a small firm which is ideal for a startup in it's early stages.

Currently we use SpeakerBox, which is good when you're volume starts to grow and you need to increase your reach. They have a good grasp into the social media scene. 
You can talk to Stephanie or John.

<p>Here in Austin <a href="http://joshdilworth.com/" rel="nofollow">Josh Jones-Dilworth</a> has a boutique firm which caters <em>only</em> to startups.  He used to work at a high-powered PR firm so he knows that world, but now he's an entrepreneur himself and wants to stay small and focused.</p>

<p>Tell him I sent you.</p>
