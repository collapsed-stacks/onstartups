I am planning to work as a partner in a startup along with my friend. Since he is a critical resource so he is taking a major chunk of the equity and holds the decision making power. I being a part time guy is getting a minimal equity. I am little bit worried being a minority partner whether it would be a good decision to be part of it or not. Can I be a full time guy ever with such a minimal equity make up the good profits. Just wanted to know the factors that I have to considered before I get into it as I have a limited knowledge on the partnership.

Any insights would be helpful.

Being part time and having minimal equity seems to put you in a position of very little risk at the moment. 

If it gets to the point where you want to go full time in the venture then they need to be profitable enough to pay you to do so. Either they pay you a salary, or the profit distributions paid out to you based on your equity is enough to pay you to work full time. 

So the company just needs to get to the point where it has enough income to hire you. Until then you work part time at your convenience.
