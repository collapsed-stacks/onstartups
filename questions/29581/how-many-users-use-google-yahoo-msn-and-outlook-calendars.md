I'm working on a product and needs to check how many users are using web based calendars. Or how many users create calendar events per year. I need this to figure out the market size. I tried to google those terms but did not turn up anything. 

Worst case scenario, how can I calculate rough #'s if no concrete information is found?
Any help is much appreciated.

<p>Off the top of my head, unless you can find a source that explicitly reveals this information, you can try and work backwards through their traffic data for the strictly web-based calendars.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/google.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/yahoo.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/msn.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/msn.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You'd need to find out the sub-domain associated with the calendar, then try and use that to filter out the traffic. Though it looks like Yahoo is the only one that still uses calendar.yahoo.com I believe, the others redirect so you'll have to do some research. A 'fuzzy' answer at best, but possibly better than nothing.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could try digging through their <a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml" rel="nofollow">SEC filings</a>. Just a guess, but they may actually discuss user/traffic figures when talking about their products.</p>

There's really no good way to figure this out based on web traffic stats (things like Alexa & Compete are highly inaccurate and even worse for something like this).  Odds are that the only way to really get a solid estimation of this would be through a survey conducted by a market research firm (which can carry a substantial cost)
