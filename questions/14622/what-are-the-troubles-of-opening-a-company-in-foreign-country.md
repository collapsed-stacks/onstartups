Has anybody here actually done this? What were the problems? How can cultural differences affect businesses? Was the non-citizenship troubling? Maybe it is best to stay where you are? Or maybe it is best to try in your country first?

I am asking this, because I want to immigrate from my country, having industry problems (Russia), to something more stable (U.K. preferable) later on, and I don't want to write code full-day all my life.

Well, just be realistic and accept that it will be harder. You'll inevitably face additional barriers for all the obvious reasons - language, culture, local possibly longer established competitors, learning curve to understand local markets, etc.

But, having said that, there is no one thing that will stop you. Perserverance (and luck) don't respect cultural boundaries. Perhaps your outsider's fresh view will give you advantages over locals.
