This is a non tech small business marketing question but hopefully you guys don't mind. If you do I guess it will be closed down.

My wife has started a small cake business in London: Art of Sumptuous Cakes

We have very small advertising budget but virtually all our business comes from Google adwords. Of the bidding options available what is the best choice for a business like ours?

[A] Focus on clicks - manual bidding. Have tried this with auto adjustment for when a keyword was not first page but frequently hit the daily budget quickly

[B] Focus on clicks - automatic bidding - started with this, high number of clicks but not many conversions

[C] Focus on conversions - have just started using this method as we are starting to collect conversion data. Having tried direct online purchase, it was not successful. People ordering cakes seem want to have a conversation via email / phone, so defined our conversion as form submit on the Contact Us page. Bit worried this option does not seem to provide as many clicks and can use up the daily budget quite quickly. Advice on whether the Max CPA or Target CPA is the better option

Have started to gather data on all three and is that just the best option? There doesn't appear to be a way to A/B test bidding options so run each for a month at a time with the same keywords and AD's and just measure conversions?

<p>I'm rusty with Adwords, but if you're asking that question I'm pretty sure you're not using your budget efficiently.  Standard settings tend to err on the side of more money for Google.</p>

<p>Manual is best - but once you know what you're doing.</p>

<p>Here's some resources that will help:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ppchero.com/" rel="nofollow">PPC Hero</a> Ugly website, but good
information</li>
<li><a href="http://ppcblog.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">PPC Blog</a> Good for background</li>
<li><a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/sew_archive_experts&amp;type=search-advertising&amp;issue=2011" rel="nofollow">Search Engine Watch PPC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pagezero.com/publications/google-adwords-guide.php" rel="nofollow">Free Adwords Intro ebook</a> Basic
intro from the author of The Winning
Guide to Adwords</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're burning the budget too fast, try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exclude your own domain - people who
search for
artofsumptuouscakes already
know who you are, so don't need to be
paid for.</li>
<li>Consider excluding idle interest
searches you may be getting -
"birthday cake ideas" "birthday cake
jpeg" "football cake pictures" and the like.</li>
<li>Consider focussing on money out
searches - "buy birthday cake" "buy
novelty cake" etc</li>
<li>Try and find lower volume searches where the bid price will be cheaper - for example "buy birthday cake chelsea" for wherever you're based, then surrounding areas etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your logs and conversions will tell you which are costing you.  Often excluding has most effect as you trim those who aren't going to convert, so your budget runs the campaign for longer.</p>

<p>Once you have some active bids running, and your click through rate goes up, try dropping the amount - bid price isn't the only thing deciding your ad placement.  Click through rate, bounce rate and site "quality" have an effect too.  So regularly tune your pricing, or you'll end up overpaying.</p>

<p>Here is how I would advise handling AdWords:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a list of your best buying
phrases and choose the best phrase
according to likely commercial
intent (how likely someone will be
to be in the buying mood given what
they are searching for), competition
(cost-per-click), and local search
popularity (how many people are
searching for the term in your area). In order of importance, it should be commercial intent, popularity, and then competition. It's
important to start with only one key
phrase, but keep your list for later
use.</li>
<li>Exclude all ad locations except for
those appearing on the search engine
results pages (SERPs). It's not that
website ads don't work, it's just
that SERPs give you more information
and you can control the exact phrase
you want to be found under.</li>
<li>Since you're also a local business,
make sure that you aren't appearing
under global results. You'll want to
limit appearing to your potential
delivery area. You might want to include a city or area name in your search phrase.</li>
<li>AdWords also allows you to do broad
or exact matches. A broad match will
display your ad if your target words
appear in the search query, no
matter what else in the query or in
what order the words appear. You
don't want broad match, you want to
control absolutely every aspect of
your ad, so you should select exact
match which will cause your ad to
appear under the exact phrase that
you enter.</li>
<li>It looks like you're already doing
this, but <strong>always</strong> set a daily budget.</li>
<li>Always bid for the first spot. It
converts at a higher rate and because of Google's
bid system, you will very
rarely end up paying the full price
of your bid.</li>
<li>The whole point of your ad should be
to get the user to click on the
link. The title should include the
search phrase but should also make
sense grammatically and be
compelling. The description should
give further incentive to click on
the title. Everything you've ever
heard or read about link bait and
<a href="http://www.virtuosimedia.com/business/copywriting/secret-formula-how-to-write-viral-content-for-your-website" rel="nofollow">viral content</a> (disclosure: a tutorial on my site) can be applied
here.</li>
<li>Now it's time to begin testing the
ad. To do this, you need to have
several versions for the same
keyword phrase, testing out
different combinations of titles and
descriptions. What you're testing
here is which has the best
click-through rate (CTR). Once
you've established a winner, use
that as your control group against
which you'll test the performance of
future ads for the same keyword
phrase.</li>
<li>Your landing page should match the
promise of your ad. In fact, you should use the same wording. Don't surprise the user in any way or you'll lose the conversion. Your landing page should
have one testable action that you
want the user to perform when they
get there. The number of users that
arrive at your page from the ad
divided by the number that perform
your action is your conversion rate.</li>
<li>Just like you tested different ad
variations, you should also test
various landing pages. Test copy,
images, colors, and even your offer.</li>
<li>You should test both your CTR and
 your conversion rates
 simultaneously and continuously
 until your campaign becomes
 profitable. Then, test more
 variations to see if you can make
 it more profitable.</li>
<li>It's important to understand that
 you're going to need a budget for
 testing. There really isn't any way
 around this, but the good news is
 that when you're done testing a
 campaign, it should be profitable. Once you've made one campaign profitable and you're positive that for every X dollars you put into advertising, you'll get X+Y dollars back, turn up the budget. Then, move on to the next keyword phrase. Rinse, repeat.</li>
</ol>
