We've been thinking of offering hosted/managed service of SugarCRM to our client.
The community edition is licensed under Affero GPL.
My questions, with this license in place, can we:

 1. Offer the hosted service at all? 
 2. Change the SugarCRM's UI layout, such that our company logo is put somewhere in there?
 3. Develop an app that interact with SugarCRM's database without releasing the code?

Thanks before,

Of course you can offer hosted service, why couldn't you? You also can change anything as long as you provide a download link for the modified code as well. For all the rest, see here: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/107883/agpl-what-you-can-do-and-what-you-cant
