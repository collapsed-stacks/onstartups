Myself and a few others have been doing a bit of research and couldn’t find anything on the following. 

A virtual pc, where I could use my not-so-good current pc but have access to a much better, higher specified one in the cloud. There I could access all of the programs and applications that I want just as if I had the pc in front of me. I understand this would be a monumental task to undertake for anyone but it would change computing. Its like "GoToMyPc" but its not your pc, its a high spec remote server.

I don’t know if there is anything being developed at the moment so if you know of any please leave a comment.Is this even possible?

Thanks

<p>It sounds like you're talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_virtualization" rel="nofollow">desktop virtualization</a>, or more generally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" rel="nofollow">software as a service</a>? It's not a new idea; I believe it goes back to the concept of dummy terminals way back in the day.</p>

<p>There are many companies that offer these services to both enterprises and small businesses, but one name that seems to come up a lot is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrix" rel="nofollow">Citrix</a>. Hope this helps!</p>

What you will find is that your not-so-current pc will become the bottleneck in accessing the much better one in the cloud.  It will begin to drag down the performance of the better one.  As Alex mentioned, this already exists with Citrix, PC Anywhere and some others.
