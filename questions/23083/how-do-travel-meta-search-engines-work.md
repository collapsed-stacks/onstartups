I am a member of a travel startup and would like to include a travel meta-search on the website.  However, I would like for it to function similar to Kayak's engine (referral only).  

How would one accomplish this?  I am confused between the following three options:

1.  Crawling the web.
2.  Many travel vendors (i.e. airlines, hotels, Expedia) have affiliate programs.
3.  Individual partnership agreements.

I understand the concept of GDSes but since I do not intend on selling any travel products on my website, I am wondering how I search others' fares/rates and include that in my meta-search engine.


Thanks,

Li Zhou

Most companies that are doing this (Orbitz, Hipmunk) have contracts to get the data from [ITA](http://www.itasoftware.com/).
