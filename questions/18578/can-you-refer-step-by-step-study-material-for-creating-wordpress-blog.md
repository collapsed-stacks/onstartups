I am a newbie to Wordpress and have set up a hosted blog with wordpress but the default theme is not what i am looking for. I am looking for a theme that is SEO optimised and then also have the ability to have rss feed, add email subscriber and option of users to retweet/facebook like.

Can you suggest a theme/template that will have these features builtin and also looking for a good source where i can read and learn about setting up my blog effectively like changing the appearance, using plugins and widgets.

You response is highly appreciated

<p>I also use <a href="http://www.woothemes.com" rel="nofollow">WooThemes</a> extensively and recommend them. Another very popular theme that has strong SEO performance is <a href="http://diythemes.com/" rel="nofollow">Thesis</a>.</p>
