We are trying to target the education sector for our business, we are developing the resources with the following features:

* Interactive animation for subject content
* Examination
* Tracking system (Provide charts for Strength/Weakness in any Subject/Chapter/Topics)
* Growth tracking system
* Viewing animated videos
* Audio books for subjects
* Q/A forum
* Messaging

For all above facilities we are making a website as well as a desktop application, that will be available to students on and offline.
Our prime idea is to provide the technological, interactive learning backbone to the schools.

I have 2 question on this,<br>
1. What is missing in our model? What should be added and what should be clarified? <br>
2. What should be the strategy to market the product?

Note: Coming from technical background, what kind of managerial points should we keep in mind?

You should narrow your target segment. Go a step down from the "Educational sector". Describe the typical profile of your end-user and re-think the portfolio of your service(s).
The list you provided could be shortened. Make it sharper. It's easier (and less costly) to market "one" product than a whole list of items.
