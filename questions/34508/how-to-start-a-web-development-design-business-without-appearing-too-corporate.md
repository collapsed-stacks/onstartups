## How to start a web development/design business without appearing too "corporate"?

These days, I've noticed that a lot of the one man (woman) shops all try to appear larger than life, i.e. go for a corporate look. I find that given how Social Media has progressed, this isn't a very smart strategy as, eventually, you will get called out... in my humble opinion.

So here's my question: I have a good number of skills, but I don't want to use my personal name/domain as my business. I want to start a company, but how do I portray myself as 1 - 2 person shop? For example, in the copywriting, do I say "<em>WE</em> offer design services" or "<em>I</em> offer design services"?

With "We", I fear that it's falling into the corporate appearance trap and with "I", my worry is that clients won't take me seriously enough.

Any thoughts? Can you show me links of companies that are run by 1 to 2 people but have crafted their services well? In other words, they look super professional (but not "IBM" type corporate), but at the same time, they offer a more personal level of service.

In short:

1) Be very authentic for where you are right now. "I" as a subject is fine (although web copy really needs to emphasize the reader's problems and needs, not you.) When you turn into a "we" you can edit or rewrite your stuff accordingly. Don't worry about not being taken seriously for this reason: everyone wants something a little different. You won't sell to the client that has to see an agency with bodies at desks. But you will sell to value conscious clients who are looking for substance.

2) Invent a company name. Register a domain that matches that name. Then register a "doing business as" or trademark for your business, in order to stake an exclusive legal claim to the name. Visit your state's secretary of state web site for details on this procedure. (Note: the application process with the state will reveal whether the trade name is available or is in use. It would be best to research this before committing to a domain name based on the trade name.)

3) Yes, your instincts about not using your personal name or domain for your business are correct. Almost all business clients (IE, all B2B customers) will expect to deal with businesses. However, it's common for one person businesses to operate under a trade name. It looks more professional.
