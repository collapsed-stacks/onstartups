I am trying to build my email list and have used several different ways to do this without any success. I have used social media sites and have Company Pages on Facebook and Google. I have used polls, surveys, etc. I have made many attempts at offering free items such as free consults, free services, discounted services, free e-books. I have put a signup box on every page of my website. My target markets are other small businesses and nonprofit organizations. I am just out of possible solutions and would greatly appreciate any suggestions.

All of the methods you list involve people coming to you(r site/FB/etc).

Figure out who your target audience is and then go to them.
