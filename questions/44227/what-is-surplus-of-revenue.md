What is the definition of 'surplus of revenue'? My textbook's explanation of revenue doesn't cover this. 

For some context, here is a question from my textbook:

>In the financial year 2008-2009, Liverpool Football Club announced a rise in operating profits to £8.5 millions.

>This information necessarily means the Liverpool FC's

>C (answer) - surplus of revenue over costs increased in 2008-2009

Simply, this is the amount over which a business is willing to accept for a product.

Put another way, if the market price is £10, but you are willing to accept a price of £5, because that covers your costs and gives you reasonable margin, your surplus of revenue is £5, as long as you charge £10.  In this case you might only charge £8 or £9, just so you can price under market, and still have a surplus of revenue.  The ideal is to maximise surplus of revenue, as that's money that's theoretically "on the table"
