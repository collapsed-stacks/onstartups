<p>I am working on a hardware-software combo B2B startup in Seattle. We've only been around for 2 weeks on a part-time basis. We are two somewhat experienced software/web devs. Together we secured a $30K @ 6% investment lined up from a VC who wants us to head to their San Francisco accelerator. This is our first startup.</p>

<p>The two of us think we are outgoing and "business minded" as we have some experience with accounting, incorporating, investing (warrants/private placements/stock), and love reading the laws.  Of course we also use google analytics and kissmetrics. We pitched to the VCs and had secured a few meetings from potential future customers collecting feedback of our plans and mockups.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>are we are simply playing dressup on the business side of things</strong> in a brick and mortar B2B industry that probably requires an experienced Hustler? Our product also won't be done for at minimum, three more months. Is now the time to worry or can the business/sales focus wait till the product is complete?</p>

<p>It's better if you do this yourself at first. You'll miss out on things you could have learned from these conversations if you're not involved in this stuff early on. Your "hustler is just that, he's hustling. Plus it's really gratifying. </p>

<p>Be careful though. You need to find a balance between biz dev and production. Biz dev can suck up time really fast and you'll wonder where the day went. </p>

<p>I would say, handle the biz dev side yourself at first until you're ready to ramp up and have somebody hit the road. </p>

<p>Your job, as a startup entrepreneurs, is to figure out how to make the business model work. That means you need to talk to customers to determine what they need. Then, you can figure out how to sell it to them.</p>

<p>Once you get a viable product that people will pay for, you can hire people to hustle for you. But if you skip the "learning" step and try to outsource it, I think you're in big trouble.</p>

<p>B2B makes deciding this reasonable simple, as long as you can be objective about your skills: </p>

<p>Who are your customers? Can you get in front of the people who need to make the decision, and can you speak their language? I don't mean English or Spanish, I mean do you know the language used in their business world?</p>

<p>Do you know, and I mean really understand, the problems they have (not just the symptoms), how they impact their business, how you're going to solve this, and can you convince them that your product/service is what they need in exchange for money?</p>

<p>You know the answer already.</p>
