I am starting a design studio after doing freelance and employed work for a number of years. When pitching to new clients on behalf of the new studio, is in acceptable to refer to my old work, and if so how should it be presented ? E.g in different contexts; in the board room, in a web portfolio etc. what's the important info to include and what to leave out.

I assume your design studio is just you. If that's the case, why wouldn't you show potential clients everything you have done. It doesn't matter who you were working for at the time you did the work. Don't misrepresent the work as something your design studio did, just show it as **your** work.

Nope, but you should have a link to your personal portfolio when you introduce yourself. You don't want to misrepresent that your company did the work, not you.
