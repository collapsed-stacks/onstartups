In my experiment, I have been able to prove that I can acquire a customer (thru SEM) for $X on average. I have done this experiment N number of times, so the amount of money I have had to spend is $X/customer x N. Statistically speaking, how can I be sure that if I continue to put the X times N dollars, I will get N customers? At what point do I say that my experiment is successful in proving that I can acquire a customer for $X?

Thanks,
Apoorva

PS: Jason, I read your article on statistically significant A/B comparisons and found that very helpful. Thank You.

Thanks Apoorva!  :-)

If you've done it a few times and it works, I say go ahead and don't worry about statistical significance.

Instead, simply continue to monitor how much it's costing you.  The reason: Over time that number will change anyway due to the shifting sands of internet marketing and potential competition.

At Smart Bear we have 30+ marketing campaigns at any give time, all being montiored, all performing at various levels which change over time.  So you just have to jump in (once you've found something decent, which it sounds like you have).

If you wanted to do it purely from a numbers point of view, then you need to figure out what confidence interval and level you want and then what sample size will give you that. Check out this online calculator, http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm, for an example.

For example, let's say there are a total of 1,000 customers that you want to test your theory on. If you want a Confidence Level of 95% with an Confidence Interval of 4, then you would need a sample size of 278.
