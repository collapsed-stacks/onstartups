I am looking for a cheap transcription service for video blog material (interviews, etc).

I don't need subtitles or time syncing. Just cheap and relatively accurate transcription of video.

Does anyone have any recommendations?

<p>The Stack Overflow podcast set up a <a href="https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W4" rel="nofollow">wiki for transcripts</a>. Do you have enough listeners/viewers who would be willing to participate in a transcript wiki of your video blog?</p>

So I've used:

<pre>
TranscriptionStar â€“ iSource solution Inc. 
transcription@transcriptionstar.com
http://transcriptionstar.leapfile.com
1291 Weber Street| Pomona |CA |91768
Ph: 714-277-3909
</pre>

before and they transcribed audio files that went with videos for about $1.25/minute (advertised $1.00 but it ran a bit higher).  They did a good job although we had to go in and fix the engineering terms.

Their billing leaves a lot to be desired.

On the This Week in Google podcast, they said Google is rolling out something like this functionality for videos.  No idea if it's publicly available.

<p>We've used Mechanical Turk and it has been great.  If you don't want to figure out all of the tips and tricks of the system, there are services like <a href="http://castingwords.com/" rel="nofollow">Casting Words</a> that will organize it for you.</p>
