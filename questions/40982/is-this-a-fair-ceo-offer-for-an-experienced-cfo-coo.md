My question/story is this: two years ago I broke ground on a startup.  We planned and planned, raised some funds and broke ground writing code.  Two years later we put $250k into the business, have some good people involved, have some revenue (less than $10k), and about 4,500 users.  We have a couple proposals out to some F500 companies, and if we close them we'll be off to the races.

I have been Founder & CEO (and every other position in the book) during this time period, and recently, a CFO/COO of another large software company wants to get involved as CEO.  He has experience and connections and grew his other software company to $40mm/year biz.  

This is our offer, is it fair?

2% up front, 8% vested out over 4 years.  The equity vests on company/fundraising milestones.  He'd be paid $8k/mo when we raise $500k, and 6 months later we would discuss a raise if all is going well.

Please let me know, I have no idea.

<p><strong>Of note</strong>: an experienced large company person may not have the correct skillset to run a startup. I know some may disagree, but it is one thing to have a staff / secretary / expense account, and quite another to have to sweep the floors before you leave the building every night (because no one else will do it).  </p>

<p>I would take a look at the vesting - any reason why a <a href="http://startuplawyer.com/incorporation/what-is-four-years-with-a-one-year-cliff">1 year cliff</a> isn't in place? Performance vested and Performance accelerated vesting are considerations - but you may want to keep these incentive type programs separate and distinct from the standard options. <a href="http://capgenius.com/2011/04/24/foundervesting/">Repurchase agreement</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Single-or-double-trigger-acceleration-for-option-vesting-Which-method-is-preferred-for-startups">double-trigger</a> clauses should also be spelled out.</p>

<p>I would also be wary of issuing shares at the start - it's risky, since you likely don't know if things are going to work out - and if it doesn't, then you have an non-participant with 2% ownership.  </p>

So You are NOT paying this person who you think has the potential to run your company anything until it raises $500k.  Why would he/she do that?  Who is taking all the risk here.  You or the prospective CEO.  If he or she is as capable as you believe then they must be putting a hold on other avenues that they could travel.

The offering for a position that has a guaranteed salary and then offering shares is a lot different that offering a person a position with no salary and no guarantee.  I wouldn't touch it for your offering.

And I agree with jimg.  A start up CEO is much different than an an expansion CEO.  Start up CEO generally would have a lower cash position but a higher equity position.  An expansion CEO would generally have a higher cash position and less equity.
