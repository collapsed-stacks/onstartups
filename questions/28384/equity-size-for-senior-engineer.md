This doesn't sound like a startup to me.  You're saying company has 20-40 employees, no outside investment, and is profitable.

That's a founder's home run.

Anyhow, usually, stock options are part of the risk premium of joining a biz that has a dangerous future.

But in this scenario, there's way less risk!

How many stock options would this engineer get if he joined Microsoft or Google or Facebook?  He'd get a few (probably).  

If I were a founder, I would look at employee stock ownership plans at places like that and then design a plan like theirs.

Frankly, I think the smarter move is to design some kind of profit sharing program, rather than stock options.

This company looks like a lifestyle biz; why would the founders ever sell it?  I know I wouldn't.

And if the founders never sell, those options are worthless.
