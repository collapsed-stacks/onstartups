<p>Why aren't there popular examples (actually I haven't seen any) of the franchise model applied to online services?</p>

<p>E.g. franchise of a given service for local (different language) versions or franchise for maintaining specific sections of a broad service (for example an online apparel shop offering franchise opportunities for the shoes section or the scarves section.</p>

<p>Franchising is necessary if you want to grow fast in a capital-intensive business. Typical example: McDonalds. Opening a new restaurant requires quite a bit of a capital and is risky. McDonalds avoids the need to have cash (or debt) to open a new restaurant and it reduces its risk. McDonalds provides services (marketing, R&amp;D of creating new product, sourcing raw ingredients cheaply) that scale without lots of investment.</p>

<p>Those capital restrictions don't apply to web services. Tumblr became one of the biggest sites on the internet with a handful of employees. They simply don't need anyone's help in reaching, say, Brazilian market.</p>

<p>Then there's an issue of trust. To offer hypothetical Brazilian Tumblr, someone would have to have access to Tumblr's servers. This level of access is not how physical franchises work: McDonalds reveals very little (relatively speaking) to their franchises.</p>

<p>In the older days franchising of sorts was actually popular. For example, a game that was popular on Commodore 64 would often be licensed by some third party and published on other platforms (Atari, Amiga etc.).</p>

<p>There were also cases of companies localizing e.g. early word processing software, for their home markets.</p>

<p>But those days are gone because today a company that is successful can easily afford to do the relatively small amount of work needed to localize/translate software.</p>

<p>I guess white-labeling applies better to online services. You will find tons of examples of services that offer the white-labeling model. It is not exactly the same as franchising but there are definitely similarities.</p>
