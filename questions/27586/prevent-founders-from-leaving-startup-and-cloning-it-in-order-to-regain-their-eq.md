It seems like there can be incentive for founders to give away equity to incubators, seed investors and co-founders, and then drop the startup and build a new one doing a similar thing but keeping most of the equity.

I'm hoping to find options to reduce the chances this could make my equity as a co-founder worthless in the future.

<p><strong>That's a valid concern.</strong> It doesn't happen much, but it's still a good idea to guard against it, within reason.</p>

<p><strong>There are 'market' reasons against:</strong> Every startup requires time to build brand awareness, web presence, connections, etc. Leaving a startup that already has some momentum implies loosing this, and having to start over from scratch.</p>

<p><strong>There are 'reputation' reasons against:</strong> This would be especially strong if institutional investors (VCs) are required for the 'cloned' startup -- a call from the old VC team to the new VC team could sink the founders reputation.</p>

<p><strong>There can be / should be legal reasons against:</strong> The specifics will vary from country to country, but there are several possible places to attempt to regulate this.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Non-compete_clause" rel="nofollow">Non-compete clauses</a>, typically in the employment contract, can be effective in this case.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Shareholders_agreement" rel="nofollow">Shareholders' Agreement</a> can in some countries be used to prohibit a shareholder from launching a new company, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should go see a lawyer and obtain qualified advice relevant to your legal system and your specific situation. But bottom line, this issue can be addressed with a little bit of forethought.</p>
