There are a variety of tips for YCombinator, but we haven't been able to find anything related to TechStars. Anyone out there have experience with them?

<p>Andrew Rollins, of TechStars alumnus Localytics wrote <a href="http://www.andrewrollins.com/2009/12/29/techstars-application-tips/" rel="nofollow">a great series of tips</a> recently.</p>

<p>Andrew Hyde, TechStars' community director, <a href="http://andrewhy.de/techstars-application-tips/" rel="nofollow">covers many of the basics in his post</a>. The one startup he specifically mentions, Foodzie, wrote <a href="http://foodzie.com/blog/2009/02/applying-to-techstars-act-like-an-underdog/" rel="nofollow">their own post of advice</a>, which to me really highlights how they stood out.</p>

<p>And Healy Jones, a TechStars adviser from this summer, has <a href="http://www.startable.com/2009/12/27/techstars-boston-application-tips/" rel="nofollow">a post with application tips</a>, but I find his <a href="http://www.startable.com/2009/06/13/tips-for-the-techstars-entrepreneurs/" rel="nofollow">post of tips for once you're in</a> much more useful, in content and in insight it provides about the type of people TechStars wants.</p>

<p>The only piece of advice I can give you as a non-TechStars applicant, but Boston startupper, is make yourself known to the TechStars people. Everyone involved that I've met has been very friendly and open -- these are people who want more startups to succeed, and are just trying to find those they think are most likely to make it happen.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

Another tip I'd give you is to reach out to past TechStars founders. They're generally super helpful in providing ideas. They've also been known to provide a "heads up, these guys seem really smart" when they run into an interesting team. And don't over-focus on the application itself. you've got to have good stuff to go along with it, like continued progress, a great team, etc. Oh, and I run TechStars, so I'm not randomly making stuff up. ;-)  Feel free to reach out to me directly at David at TechStars.org or in Boston to Shawn at TechStars.org (or Andy@ in Seattle).

Another thing to think about is showing a "path of capability". Lots of people have neat ideas, but can't get the ball rolling. Thomas Edison was dead-on when he said that genius was 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.

Make progress happen on your idea. If you're a coder, code! If you're not a coder, sketch and design. Talk to real live prospective customers and get their feedback. Talk to real live prospective partners and get their feedback. Each day make a step forward in your idea / business. If you do that every single day, in the course of a week you've made 7 steps forward - which is tremendous. Even if you have to take a step back you're still WAY ahead of the game.

Make continuous progress. Show a path of capability so that we can say "hey, these folks have a clue and are working hard to push the boulder uphill - cool!".

[Disclosure: I run TechStars Boston, so as David suggests, reach out to past founders - as well as mentors - to get other perspectives too!]
