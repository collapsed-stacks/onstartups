Does anyone have an idea of what a revenue multiple for a tech startup with a transactional business model would be?

I know it would be highly variable, but any resources, thoughts or known multiples would be useful. Thanks!

Jim

<p>What do you mean by "revenue multiple"?</p>

<p>If you're thinking about estimating the fair market value of the startup based on its gross revenue (a.k.a. total sales + capital gains), then you're going wrong. The company's value will be determined by many things, of which revenue is less important -- earnings (a.k.a profit), unique technology advantages, and strategic fit with the buyer are more important.</p>

First, congratulations if you are a tech startup with revenue -- you are already ahead of the game!

I agree with Jesper that the valuation will depend a lot on the type of business, the profitability, the growth potential of the business, and any perceived "premiums."  Also, is this a valuation for seeking investment, or for exiting?

In general, I would say <1 - 4x.  For software and Saas businesses with growth and perceived premiums, maybe 10x EBIT, which might be about 2-4x.  

There are plenty of blogs and articles on this topic -- just Google "valuation for XXXX business".  Also, you can read some SEC filings on companies in your industry that are involved in acquisitions.

I think most web business can be valuated or actually sold for 2x - 3x annual revenue as long as there is room for growth, and positive growth (business is not sinking).
