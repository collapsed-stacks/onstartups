I started a company in 6/09 as a SP - In 9/09 I joined ventures with another company that took my company name and LLC it. In 8/10 I bought 100% of the company back from them. I am in the process of creating a new operating agreement.

Question is what date do I use when I say I am creating this new OA? I have the purchase date from when I purchased it from the other company, I have the date that the State recognized the LLC and then there is todays date as I am creating a new OA?

I just don't want to have an issue if someone ask for me OA and I have different dates.

Thanks,
MD

Sign with today's date and have a clause that older OA's are overridden.

You own 100% of the company (state that in the OA with your signature), so you can reset the rules whenever you like.

Note: I'm no lawyer, this is not legal advice, etc :P
