I have software product and I found myself doing lot's of demos which is not needed. I also don't want to create text manuals.

So, my idea is to create video training and demonstration materials.

I'm looking for some tool which will help me doing this. I will need things like:

1. Take video of desktop and portions of it - allowing zoop, etc.
2. Edit video - add captions, arrows, etc.
3. Edit video - add soundtrack.

My idea is to make video, than write text and let dedicated person to read it out in sync with video and record audio like this.

Any suggestions on what I should use? I'm not even sure if question belongs to startups but it is kind of startup problem

<p>My recommendation is <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html" rel="nofollow">Camtasia</a>. It is available for Mac and Windows and will do everything you listed.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html" rel="nofollow">Jing</a> for this.  It captures video from the screen (note: it has a 5 minutes recording limit, so sometimes you need to do multiple recording chunks).</p>

<p>After I've captured the videos, I import them into iMovie to do all voiceovers, background audio, and visual effects bits.</p>

I personally use and recommend Camtasia (Mac or PC).

If you're using a Mac you could also try SnapZ Pro X or ScreenFlow.

Screenr is another freemium screen recorder not mentioned yet.

If you want something even more powerful (and have money to spend) I would recommend Articulate's new Storyline software:
