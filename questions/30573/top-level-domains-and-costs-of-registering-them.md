Top level domains are going to cost a lot to register so for instance www.drink.coke could be around $100,000+.

However, once .coke has been registered, would it be cheaper to then register let's say www.buy.coke or is it a one time massive fee for every single domain on that top level domain?

Let me explain it in this way: .xxx will cost $100000 to purchase, aaa.xxx will cost $10 to purchase from registrar that purchased .xxx

what you are talking about there is a subdomain...top domains are word.ext. Subdomains are created by the top level domain owner and cost nothing to create

top level domains can be created/bought for under $10

steer away from anything that is trademarked too

Haha... yeah! what you said is buying domain extension not domain.


.com, .net, .org etc are domain extensions.

where something.com, nothing.net, company.org are called as domains.

From your question I understood that you wanna buy a new domain extension instead of domain and to sell the domain of your extension. Of course this is a good idea.

As you said drink.coke domain will be costlier than `.coke` extension its false.

There is an organization for it called ICCAN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) You can contact ICCAN and buy a new domain extension from them. New domain extension costs $50Mn from that you can derive unlimited domains and you can fix your own price. Per domain registration you have to pay $0.10 as ICCAN fee.

But this is a great business. If you purchase a smart extension you can earn millions of dollar by selling domains.

Hope this is what you want...



All the best.
