Do you feel that you should always look for earlyvangelists for each startup? For example with an existing market and your differentiator being that your service is cheaper, or easier to use, would it still be necessary to seek out those earlyvangelists? 

Two characteristics of an Earlyvangelist being:

1. Has put together a solution out of piece parts.
2. Has or can aquire a budget.

I guess that if something is cheaper or easier to use then it's still addressing a pain point, a problem, to some extent, but less likely that the earlyvangelist is using a homemade solution if a solution already exists and just happens to be expensive or quite difficult to use.

I have a concern that the existence of earlyvangelists might not extend to potential customers beyond that group, i know that finding that out would be a part of the process anyway and its got to be tested to find out.

Yes, I believe a you still need to find earlyvangelists when creating a low-cost disrupter.  You'll basically be targeting two types of people.

 **1. Users of existing products in your market:** Many argue that your product or service needs to be significantly better (by as much as 10x) than the competition in order to get an existing consumer to switch. Basically, there are switching costs for a consumer in the form of time, effort, learning curve, unknowns, etc. So the product needs to so good that it's worth the risk and effort involved in switching.  The notable exception would be the early adopters who are willing to try many different products. They are the ones who are happy to pay a little extra to try a product that may only be slightly better.  But the earlyvangelists of that group will help you get to 10x better, if they see that you are responsive to their feedback and are working with them to build the killer product.  Ultimately, for this group you need a signicantly better product.

 **2. Non-consumers:**  These are folks who didn't use any of the existing products typically due to price.  Finding an earlyvangelist, one who put their own solution together, could help you identify with the group and determine the needs of these non-consumers.  In this case, you aren't competing on functionality with the major competitors.  You are actually competing on a combination of price and functionality with their cobbled-together solution.

In both cases, earlyvangelists give you great feedback and help you improve your offering.
