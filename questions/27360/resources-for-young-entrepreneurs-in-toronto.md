I'm going to be finishing my master's degree in computer science soon, and am interested in pursuing entrepreneurship. I'm currently based in Montreal, but for personal reasons, am considering moving to Toronto after I finish my degree. In Montreal, I know there are many resources to help young entrepreneurs, including the following:

* Regular social events, such as [Startup Drinks][1] (there is a Startup Drinks for Toronto listed on the linked site, but the site hasn't been updated for awhile, so I'm not sure if it's active)
* Sporadic social events such as hackathons and [conferences][2]
* [Blogs][3] dedicated specifically to covering technology startups in Montreal
* [Angel investor groups][4]
* Co-working spaces (including free, shared spaces) such as [RPM][5] and [Notman House][6]

I'd appreciate it if someone could point me to similar resources in Toronto, if they exist. Any other useful information regarding pursuing entrepreneurship in Toronto would also be appreciated.

<p>hey there: there are lots of resources in Toronto. </p>

<p>StartupDrinks happens here every month as well: our last Toronto <a href="http://sud21to-eorg.eventbrite.com/" rel="nofollow">startup drinks</a> just happened in June</p>

<p>Check out: <a href="http://startupnorth.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://startupnorth.ca/</a> for startup info about Toronto startups and events. Startupnorth also has a calendar of events</p>

[DemoCamp](http://democamp.com/) started in Toronto, and while it's a bit less regular than it used to be, it's still the biggest more-than-annual gathering of tech/entrepreneur types in TO.  [The Entrepreneurship 101 course at MaRS](http://www.marsdd.com/events/event_series/entrepreneurship-101/) should start up again in September; it's a great place to learn and network.

Democamp is probably the best place to meet the most people in one evening. Start there and get some introductions.  A few other suggestions...

Ryerson Digital Media Zone - http://digitalmediazone.ryerson.ca/ - open to more than just Ryerson students and alumni. They have space for promising projects.

http://www.Davidcrow.ca - read back through his blog posts and you will find just about everything that has happened or is happening here.

Advisory services at marsdd.com, venturelab.ca (Markham / York Region) and riccentre.ca (Mississauga) once you are past the idea stage. MaRS has posted a lot of their material from courses and events on-line.

Techvibes.com has reasonable coverage of Toronto events in addition to StartupNorth.ca as suggested.

Extreme U at Extreme Venture Partners extremevp.com/extreme-university-2011/

This blog has some interesting posts from time to time...

People in Toronto know people in Montreal, ask your network in Montreal for some introductions.

<p>Also make sure to take a look and get involved with the <a href="http://www.thec100.org/" rel="nofollow">C100</a>. They're a great group of people who have a lot to offer, and can help you find a mentor.  On top of that, a lot of independents, both consultants and startup creators hang out at the following coffee shops:</p>

<p>Dark Horse, Spadina</p>

<p>Aroma, Bathurst and Bloor-ish</p>

<p>Linux cafe, Harbord and Grace</p>

<p>Finally, don't forget Betty's, on King Street, it's a great pub in the middle of a bustling Toronto tech area.  People from Alias (now Autodesk), SAS, PlateSpin, Monster, VMLogix, Stars/DKP, and other smaller ventures hang out there - we have for years.</p>
