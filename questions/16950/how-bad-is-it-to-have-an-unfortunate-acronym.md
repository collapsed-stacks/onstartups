We've all heard the sad story of ExpertsExchange.com, where an unintended misreading turned out to be quite unfortunate for them.  

What about if the company/product/domain name is fine, but if shortened to an acronym it is just as dodgy? People often acronymize long names...   
E.g. Avid Security Software...

It's unfortunate and worth changing if it distracts from getting stuff done.  

In the early '90s I worked for a company that, when founded in the '60s, was called **PMS** Corporation.  Then, in the '80s folks began to understand and recognize Premenstrual syndrome as a real issue.  And *then* the jokes started to the point of distraction.  So the company renamed itself PMSC and later other varations.

All publicity is good publicity.   And nothing beats free publicity, even for the wrong reasons.  

I think for my next venture I am going to start an online Fountain Pen store...
And I think I will specialize in refilling and repairing Antique Fountain Pens!
And I will name it....

If you could, kim kardashian would be working at Hooters.

It's bad!

ExpertsExchange actually added a hyphen in their name to try to prevent the misreading. They are actually: www.experts-exchange.com
