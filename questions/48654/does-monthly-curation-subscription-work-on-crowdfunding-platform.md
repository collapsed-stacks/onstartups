Currently, I launched a monthly discovery business; I have yet to find another monthly discovery business started off on crowd-funding. We launched roughly 2 days ago (marketing on Facebook right now), I'm just curious what can I do to relieve the barrier for people to "purchase"?

1. Possibility fear of not knowing what you will get. (This is our 1st month so we do not have reference for a previous month duration.)
2. My price is too high. (We want to value high quality chocolates as well as good quantity for those to enjoy with friends and family.)
3. ??? Need more marketing to demographics. (We think its early adopters female 25+)
