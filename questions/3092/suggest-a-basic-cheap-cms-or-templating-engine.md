I run a software company selling downloadable software. Currently my site is written entirely in HTML, using a text editor. I upload it by FTP.

The chief problem I have identified with this approach is duplication. The following items are duplicated in every page:

 - Logo
 - Header
 - Footer
 - Common links (e.g. the link to my download page is in many different places)

This becomes a maintenance nightmare.

I want some way to resolve this. I want:
 - Templates - e.g. for the header and footer
 - Variables - e.g. to reference common links

I want the solution to allow plain HTML coding.

It has to be cheap, say less than $15/Â£10 a month.

What is the next step after plain HTML?

Edit - I've found that there are different classes of these systems:
 - Static site generators ( [http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=700031][1] )
 - Dynamic server side

I tend to prefer the first, because the simpler hosting keeps my costs low.

<p>You should check out Joomla, Drupal or WordPress.</p>

<p>They are more than sufficient for your needs.</p>

<p>Checkout <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/42523/joomla-wordpress-and-drupal-which-one-is-more-suitable-for-building-static-html" rel="nofollow">this question</a> at <a href="http://superuser.com" rel="nofollow">superuser.com</a>.</p>

<p>Another option that you can look at is <a href="http://sites.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Sites</a>. It does everything you need.</p>

<p>Edit: All these CMSes are free; and all that you have to pay, is the domain name and the hosting space, which works out to be less than 40 usd <em>per year</em>, in my case. </p>

<p>You can try to use a static site generator like <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a>. </p>

<p>It's designed exactly to avoid the headers and footers duplication using a template mechanism.</p>

<p>A full blow Wordpress install is really powerful, but learning to use all this power can take a lot of time.</p>

<p>Forget about CMS. It's very difficult to customize once your business needs something specific. I would suggest try django instead. See <a href="http://blog.scrum8.com/2009/nov/01/why-django-perfect-choice-startup/" rel="nofollow">my reason why</a>. It's very easy to get running, but it doesn't tied you from doing anything specific.</p>

Checkout CMS like Joomla or Drupal. 
They are extremley well designed and easy to use if you have some basic knowledge and patience to tinker around. The reason Joomla is amazing is because its like firefox browser. It has got thousands of extensions built by the community. Think of a new use, and probably there's already an extension for it.

I would highly recommend newbie CMS here: http://newbie-cms.com/demo/admin/  
Unbeatable price and very intuitive interface just for any newbie. As the ad says, it's CMS but easy and you can actually get any website template off the web and use it in 3 minutes. The video is on the website.

Joomla I find is easier to use than Drupal, however they both have many 3rd party add-ons which make either of them very versatile. I prefer Joomla both for ease of use and more third party extensions.

CityDesk might fit your needs: http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/

A 50 page version is free. It's Windows software where you componentize your pages just as you describe and then CityDesk puts them together and generates the final HTML pages.
