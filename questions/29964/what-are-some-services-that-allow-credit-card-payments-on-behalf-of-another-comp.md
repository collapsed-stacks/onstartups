## What are some services that allow credit card payments on behalf of another company (i.e. Groupon, LivingSocial, etc)?

My startup operates in a similar fashion to that of the typical daily deal sites - we accept payment from our users, take a cut off the top, and pay out the person\company providing the goods or services that we sold to our users.

BrainTree calls this "Third Party Payment Aggregation" but I think that is a BrainTree-inspired term, rather than an industry term.

I know there are many daily deals sites out there today that are doing this, but I do not know of any companies that provide such a service other than BrainTree.

Has anyone here had an experience with this or can offer any information?  It will be much appreciated.

Paypal offer a similar service called Adaptive Payments I believe, I think that relies on the end users (the people supplying your goods) to have Paypal accounts themselves. But that in itself may save you some money on the transaction fees.
