There are a lot of people marketing software libraries, components, add-ons, etc. But the overall market seems pretty small. And small scale developers seem suprisingly cheap- they often opt to develop their own solution to a problem rather than buy a library component that costs only $50.

Check out the <a href="http://www.asp-software.org">ASP</a> *(Association of Shareware Professionals)* for more information. Many of their members develop components and libraries and virtually all of them use these tools.

Targetted marketing of these components can be difficult. There is a web site <a href="http://www.componentsource.com/">Component Source</a> that specializes in selling tools like this. You can list and sell your product with them for a fee.
