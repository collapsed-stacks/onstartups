I have a site that I'd like to build in PHP/MySQL and preferably using CodeIgniter, but I don't have the time that I need to devote to building the site.  I'd like to find a developer who is willing to work with me on the project as a partner and receive payment once the site is making money.  I'm covering any costs as far as the need for servers and I also have a designer who is interested in helping.

I've posted an ad on Craigslist and got a few bites, but nothing that was serious or wasn't just an advertisement for a development company.

I'm confident that the site will make money, as it's something that fills a need for companies in the IT Consulting/Managed Services Provider field and will allow them to easily bring in more money by offering an additional service that they may not already be offering.  The service that they would offer would generate recurring monthly income for them and the site would charge a recurring monthly fee based on the number of clients that they have signed up for the service.

**That's because you don't sound serious.** You want someone to work for free, on the promise that you *might* make money - because why? Because you are footing the bill for some hardware? Hardware is cheap. Time and years of expertise is **not**.

Software development requires time. **Lots of time.** Unless you come to the table with a solid offering equal partnership in writing, you should *expect what you are offering - very little*. (and even then, it just sounds sketchy) These kinds of "partnerships" are usually done through networking - between people that have known each other for years. (see Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google)

I suggest you spend more time networking rather than advertising.

Put some time into a decent proposal, something that you think would be worthwhile and could entice a friend if they had the skills required.

Once you have a decent plan, start networking: attend start-up groups in your local area and get the word out that you are looking for someone to work with. In most major cities now there are web start-up groups that focus primarily on online start-ups. Your best bet would be to attend some of their meetings and show them your plan and let them know what you can bring to the table.

You should detail clearly what each partner gets in return for the work put in and the roles you will be filling. Make sure the other person agrees that their effort is equal to yours or at least their share of the rewards will be equal to the work they put in.

I appreciate all of the comments and advice, I definitely agree with all of you.  I did find a site that allowed me to find a developer to work with and we'll see how it ends up, but it's looking pretty good.  I just wanted to share the site with others who may be in the same boat that I'm in.

The site is http://www.builditwith.me and it allows you to post your ideas as well as search for developers looking for people with ideas.
