What is the average, or an expected, monthly income per user (daily or monthly) that you can expect from a facebook game? How does that change based on different monetization strategies, like highly aggressive strategies with lots of limited time offers?

Also, what is the average COST per user per month for facebook games as far as bandwidth, hosting, etc? I'm assuming a game that's something like farmville or happy aquarium, that's a "typical" flash facebook game. 

Round numbers are appreciated if you don't have specifics because I'm looking for any good data that's available at the moment. =)

Here is an interesting report that may answer all of the questions and more, but I believe it requires purchasing: http://www.screendigest.com/reports/201119b/2011_01_facebook_gaming_in_2010_games_market_monitor/view.html
