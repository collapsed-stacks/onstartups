OK Here is the situation: I am looking for investors, and have a group interested in my idea, so they have asked to see my business plan.
I have nearly completed my business plan, but want to be fairly sure they arent going to be scared off.

The projected figures: (it is a photography and design business) 

Investment sought: £120,000 for £32% 

Startup costs: £55,000 (which includes a large investment in equipment)

Running costs: £76,000 (Year 1), £109,000 (Year 2), £140k (Year 3)

(profit/loss based on average between my worst case and best case scenarios)

Year 1: Turnover £125,000, Break even

Year 2: Turnover £227,000, £95,000 net profit after tax

Year 3: Turnover £370,000, £182,000 net profit after tax

(these figures include additional staff members and MD's salary)

So by year 5 I hope the company to have a net worth (assets and cash) of around £850k, therefore if the investors were to cash out after 5 years, they are expected to see about £282k back from their original £120k.
Annual ROI ITRO 30% (I think?)

Is this tempting enough? or do investors expect a huge return?

The answer is not so easy. **In fact the expected ROI reflects mainly the risk of failiure.** So if you are sure (and that's not possible) that your project will succeed, then 30% ROI/year is fantastic...

But back to the real world again. I don't know particullary your business sector, but first, **ask the "industry association" what is the average bankrupcy rate within 5Y in that sector**. It varies a lot - e.g. here in Europe, it's the food & tourism (restaurants & co.) where the bankrupcy rate is the highest (if I remember well it reaches 80% within the 5 years...) 

**So that information will give you a first idea. Then add the level of competition, the actual crisis period, your (in)experience in that business and in the business in general and so on. All of this determines your chance to survive, to make benefits** (+ the REAL amount of your benefits - sorry but the BP is in 90% of cases just a tale) **and thus the chance for the investor to get his money back + some benefit.**

So in short, you can't just focus on the percentage. **In some cases, 10% per year is more than enough, sometimes even 100% will not do it.**

But OK, *with the uncomplete description of your situation*, I should say that the 30% looks adequate.

Good luck!

PS: **what looks "suspicious" in your Business Plan is that the "costs" don't vary in the time.** I suppose there are some variable costs, the amortization of your costly equipment (sooner or later you will have to replace it -> so you need to put the money aside) and what about new costs that come when the company grows (new employee, higher costs for your website, more money for marketing,...)?

Have a look at it! Maybe you did it already but if you presents the figures as you did it here, it will look "suspicious"...
