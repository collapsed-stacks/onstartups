<p>We are running a "pay what you can" charity campaign for the second year in a row. Basically, one can purchase an entry-level version of our product (a tool for Java developers) and have the net proceeds donated to our local foundation that helps kids with cancer in Siberia, whose families cannot afford expensive treatment.</p>

<p>A last year's participant has posted a link to our campaign to MyDeals.de, and we had dozens of donors from Germany in the next 48 hours. Now I am wondering what English-language deal sites could have the same effect, and what might be other ways to spread the news for free.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate any pointers, intros and thoughts that you can spare.</p>

<p>I would talk to sites like AppSumo and see if they are interested. Similarly, you could check out sites like HumbleBundle who have a similar sales mechanism.</p>
