I'm working to "relaunch" my diagramming/modeling software product in november and wondering about having or not a user-approved e-mail campaign (with whatever these types of campaigns should have for software products). Personally I dislike that type of marketing, but don't know how much would hurt/loss by not having it.

In the same line... would it be sufficient to only have a Twitter + RSS feed + blog to maintain my users informed about product/company news and info?

Thanks!

I highly recommend it. I own a site (http://fontbundlr.com) and I made sure one of the first things I did was create an email list. I use MailChimp (http://mailchimp.com). I sell font at a discount, and of every 100 people on the list at least 10 buy, which is really good. A twitter and RSS are good, but you should definitely have email lists.
