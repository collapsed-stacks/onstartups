I have a list of potential customers who I must 'interrupt' in order to get their attention. I have a website where they can join a mailing list, but for one reason or another my potential customers don't or won't search for my software. I expect to finish the software around Aug 2010, but I would like to start a marketing campaign before the product is at v1.0.

I have a rough plan of what is needed, but not sure if this is right or not.

**Step 1:** Break the current list of potential customers I have down into geographical areas so that I can target an area at a time. The reason for this is that my software is likely to need a demo in person and it makes sense to set up demo's in the same area, instead of spread around the country.

**Step 2:** Email the list of people in the geographical area I've selected with information telling them about my software. I won't supply too much information here just enough to see if they are interested and maybe a screenshot. The idea would be to generate some interest and get them to join my mailing list.

**Step 3:** Collate the list of people who have responded and send them regular updates of progress and try to entice them in offering suggestions and features as a way of building a relationship.

**Step 4:** Once a relationship is built then I can suggest a demo.

My questions are

 - Is this a good approach?
 - What do I do about people who didn't respond? Maybe the email went to the wrong person.
 - Do I follow up the people who didn't respond with a phone call or another email, or a mailshot?

How does this sound as a strategy?

I'm glad you asked, because nowadays all anyone talks about is online, permission marketing, and while I do agree that's the best kind, it's not true that 100% of software or services can be sold that way.

Unfortunately, the other way is harder.  :-)

Some thoughts:

1. You're right to start geographically.  I'd go further and say: Can you start with just the city/area you live in?  It's easier to get the meeting when you say you're a native.
1. A cold email without much information doesn't sound interesting does it?  How about a cold email WITH information?  I don't mean long, but how about informal but tell them one amazing thing that will really get their attention?
1. The main problem with cold emails is deliverability -- how will you not hit the spam filter?  This is a career by itself but you need to be thinking about it.
1. A/B test your emails.  You'll find massive differences with even simple things like subject line.
1. Send emails more than once, but with plenty of time in between.  Sometimes it takes a few hits.
1. If you send a newsletter with real info rather than just an email, that's more valuable and thus more likely to be read and not be spam.
1. Suggest a demo immediately.  You're making this into too many steps.
1. Make a 5-minute Flash demo you can push right away.  If they like that, do the in-person demo.  If you can't boil down the interesting parts into 5 minutes you have another problem.  Remember the goal isn't to show EVERYTHING it's to get them excited.

I don't recommend interupting potential customers, you are most likely to get your message discarded.  

I have had success and been successfully marketed to with a phone call, first.  Early morning, or late afternoon are typically the easiest times to get through.  If you segment your list by geography, you can call people from 9 to 10 AM or 4 to 5PM in their time across multiple time zones.

If I'm interested, I will give you my email.  Send an email thanking me for my time, providing your contact info, and an overview of your service offerings.  Follow up with me again in a week or two.  If I have a pressing need for your product or service, I will probably call you back after I read your email.  Otherwise, I'll bookmark it or archive it for later when the need arises.

It's hard work but your hustle is rewarded.

<p>Do you know where your potential customers congregate? If they're similar, do they belong to a core group of forums, professional associations or key companies? Why not target your message through these groups?</p>

<p>If you're going to interrupt someone, why not do it in front of their peers, who are facing the same issue as your target? They might be willing to comment on what you have to say.</p>
