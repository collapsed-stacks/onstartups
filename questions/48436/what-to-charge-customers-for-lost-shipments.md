I'm a very small business with limited means.  I sent a shipment to Australia from the United States via USPS Priority Mail.  I charged the customer the USPS's cost $34.80 for shipping plus for three of my products which are $39 each.  USPS promises delivery in 6 to 10 business days.  The shipment didn't arrive in 10 business days.  The tracking information says its in Australia somewhere.  I asked the customer to wait and if nothing was received I would re-send.

It's now been almost a month.  I requested my insurance money from USPS.  They said they will pay me in one month if the shipment hasn't arrived.  I suppose they're betting that it will eventually show up.  I bet they're right.

I got a quote from UPS and they want to charge $143 (FedEx was similar).  Resending three products plus $143 would cost me months of profit.

What if anything should I charge the customer for reshipment?

If the customer didn't do anything to cause the reshipment - rejecting delivery, mail forwarding, etc - then you shouldn't charge them anything.

Yes, I know it sucks.. but think about it:

*Would **you** do business with a company that punished you when someone else made a mistake when you had no control, influence, or even information on what happened?*


On another point, if $143 is "months of profit" you should re-evaluate your numbers and process. Maybe it's just not cost effective for you to ship internationally?
