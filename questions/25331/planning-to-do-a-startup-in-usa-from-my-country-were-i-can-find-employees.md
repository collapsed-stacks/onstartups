Im planning to hire 3 employees in a soon to be corporation in USA, but I would be only a director because of my passive role as a non immigrant. How I can find qualified people, meet them in a trip or something. Also is important to have resources to manage all their needs in salary or benefits in the best way possible. I would manage them by distance so is important to seek for good people. I'm looking for any opinions or good ideas. FYI Im doing my incorporation by incorporate.com or something similar because Im in another country. Im just starting and don't have a lot of money. Thanks.

Do you absolutely have to have employees in the US, or do you just need local sales? I've seen similar scenarios where technology have been started overseas, and people visit the US regularly to conduct business.
