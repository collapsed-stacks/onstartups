<p>I belong to a non english speaking country and I have no knowledge about finance and/or accounting. However, I try to learn their basics since they are mandatory for the success of a startup.</p>

<p>One of the words I often encounter is "issue" and "issuance", but unfortunately I still cannot understand them. Some examples will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>For example, what does it mean in wikipedia definition of capital stock:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stock of a corporation is partitioned into shares, the total of
  which are stated at the time of business formation. Additional shares
  may subsequently be authorized by the existing shareholders and issued
  by the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>thank you</p>
