I have been approached by a company called "Cavendish Management Resources" (http://www.cmrworld.com/) - They say they are interested in putting my business idea forwards to their investors, which is nice! (this was via a pitch that i put on AngelInvestmentNetwork.co.uk)

So my question is, are they a known company, are they legit? and am i likely to pay through the nose...?

<p>They are looking for you to add your listing on their exchange - a free service.  </p>

<p>CMR seem to be listed on duedil as an active company:
<a href="https://www.duedil.com/company/IE354111/cavendish-management-resources-limited" rel="nofollow">https://www.duedil.com/company/IE354111/cavendish-management-resources-limited</a></p>

<p>and (from the <a href="http://www.cmrworld.com/bexchange/" rel="nofollow">fundex page</a>) they charge a minor 2% success fee (reducing to .25% on larger investment size).  Whether or not this approach is useful / cost effective is something only you can determine. </p>
