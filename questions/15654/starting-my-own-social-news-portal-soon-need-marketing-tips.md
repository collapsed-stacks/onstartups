I am starting my own social news portal called TrimHold.com , a project that I have been working on for over a year now. It is a Trilingual website ( Arabic, French, English).

The site basically aggregates news from top sources around the internet and categorize them.

User can Trim news, comment, follow other users, get followed, etc... All the stuff we know.

I want to start marketing my site. I was thinking writing a news entry for mashable that describes my site ? What do u think guys ?

I think submitting an article to Mashable is a great idea, I've never done and would be curious to know if they openly accept articles.  In addition would try to think of other verticals that would have a following similar to the type of user you are looking to engage.

This requires that you really understand the 'Who' and 'Why' of your marketing plan.  Why do people want to use your service?  Who are they?  Knowing these things will allow you to be where they are so they can know who you are.  In addition make sure your site has strong social integration so people can 'like' and 'share' the news from your site out to their social network.  This will help to create a viral effect for your product promotion.
