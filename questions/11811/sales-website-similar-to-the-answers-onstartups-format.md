I recently joined a startup and am glad that I found this website to help out with startup related questions etc...

I was wondering, does anyone know if there exists a similar website to that of Answers.Onstartups.com but specifically focused on B2B Sales?

It would be great to connect with our Sales executives, share and discuss challenges/successes as well as benefit from some coaching.

Thank you kindly,

-Danny

No reason you can't ask those questions here... lots of us (me included) specialize in B2B.

In general there's no other StackExchange-based site for that.  Of course there are forums etc but it would take some research to find which, if any, are high-fidelity.
