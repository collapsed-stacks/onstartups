My parents have been using a satellite connection for several years - it's the only thing available in their area that has reasonable bandwidth.  They can theoretically use cell service, and in some cases that would be preferred but not when it comes to downloading anything of significance.

Because of the extraordinary latency of a satellite connection (which ultimately is based on how long it takes the signal to go up to geosynch orbit and back down, then repeat to come back - about .65 seconds best case) many applications have trouble with it.  On the other hand, when you want to download a big file it actually works very well - streaming protocols (and even a TCP/IP socket, if doing a sustained transfer) will optimize to the latency.  

I ended up setting up a caching proxy server for their computers to share and their experience has been pretty reasonable.  But, if 3G coverage comes to their area (likely eventually...) I would ditch it provided that an "all you can eat" data plan was available.

**Bottom line:  It's better than a modem or 2G cell service**.  Otherwise, keep looking.  Don't forget about line-of-site wireless options:  Depending on your geography those can be done for 10-50 miles.

It depends on where you are, where you will be surfing from and what your requirements are.

So, if you want to surf while on your boat, then it may be helpful, if you are out of reach of cell towers.

If you want to surf from home then it may not make as much sense.

So, will you be needing to frequently surf when there are no cell phone towers available?

Do you mean you want to get a connection from an ISP who gives its users satellite internet connection ?
well it will depend on the speed and the price then.

If satellite is your only choice and you do not have 2G, 3G or 4G services available in your area, then you really have no other choice. However if you're wanting to browse the internet on a satellite connection when other options are viable, you're wasting money as satellite services are generally more limited and expensive.
