We started freelancing. However, most of our projects have failed because we had to do what we are not experienced with. For example, say our expertise is ASP, but we can't wait for ASP projects to become available, so we take a JSP project instead, which we are not experienced with.

How did you succeed and sustain freelancer jobs?

Our next target is to find local customers in need of a software solution and develop what they need. Is this a good idea? Or should we develop a generic product (say a CRM) and present it to customers and deliver it on demand (a customized one)?

Firstly you need to make sure you operate a business with integrity or you will have real trouble getting a growing list of customers. It sounds concerning that you have been accepting projects for work that you cannot do.  If you only know ASP, don't take on JSP projects, I assume your clients didn't know that you weren't experienced in JSP.

As for getting success with freelancer jobs, there is no magic answer.  You need to find jobs and deliver successful outcomes.  Word of mouth will then work for you and not against you.

As for starting a product, you are going to find it really challenging if you just choose a product for the sake of it. You need to be passionate about the product, but also have expertise in the problem you are solving. "developing a generic product" is going to be very hard, there are going to be many competitors in the market already, and they have time and money behind them, how are you going to differentiate or be better?

I would recommend get your freelancer work going, and make sure you have successful projects. Once you have a steady income stream from this, you can start to spend some of your time building a product. I would also wait to you have a real need or passion for a product, don't just create anything because it seems like a good lifestyle, it is hard work, and hard to be successful.

D-Shan, I bet there is loads of work out there. If you can't get work for X and you are an expert in X, then X is not the problem. Something else is.

I suspect it's that you don't know how to sell your services. The biggest mistake I made as an IT professional was thinking that just because I was good at X I would get work for X.  Nope. 

You need a salesman to get sales. A programmer to do the work. Sounds like you've got the wrong man for the salesman's job.

The biggest problem we have when selling our own services is because we're so damn good at what we do, and because it comes so naturally, we end up under valuing it, and not being able to sell it efficiently.  

Find someone (or learn yourself) how to value what you do, learn how to demonstrate value to prospective clients, and when your value (in their eyes) is higher than your price. You'll start getting business.

And when you learn how to do this. Business won't stop coming in.

Your question has elements of long range business planning mixed with "survival" activities. I assume that the freelancing is to get started and your long range plan is to have products.

About freelancing and how I stayed in business doing software contracting for about 18 years:

So you say you have had problems accepting work that you aren't qualified to perform. 

Almost all clients hire contractors because they are expert at some skill that the client doesn't have in-house. You simply must not accept projects that require knowledge and skills that you do not have. Unless: you are prepared to invest whatever effort is necessary to overcome your learning curve, and to do so at your expense and not the client's expense. 

Almost all freelancers make a steady living by being really good at one particular thing such as a language skill set applied in a particular domain. 

For example, I made a living for years developing Windows client applications and actual products using C++ and Delphi. 

To freelance successfully and consistently you have to be kind of a "one stop shop" for a particular kind of solution. In general, most freelancers have better luck when they specialize somehow. This would be the absolute remedy for accepting projects that don't fit your skills. 

> Our next target is to find local customers in need of a software solution and develop what they need. Is this a good idea? 

If you are trying to build a business, it's only a good idea if you can keep the rights to the code that you develop. Ideally, you build a base of code assets from past freelance projects that you can re-use. In other words, avoid work-for-hire arrangements and assigning all rights to the client. In that instance it becomes temporary labor. 

Also, it's only a good idea if you can actually sell the ability to create those solutions. Again, you need to specialize in particular types of problems. 

> Or should we develop a generic product (say a CRM) and present it to customers and deliver it on demand (a customized one)?

A few things:

Good luck presenting a CRM or any other plain old tool to business customers and having them understand what they just saw. Besides, a CRM may not fit the client's needs at all. 

Demos DO work but only when the demo shows things that the prospect can relate to. You would have no luck showing a CRM to an end user. Show a prospect something that appears to solve one of their current problems and perhaps you can win them as a possible client. 

Find unique business problems that clients have and solve them. And define a niche to go after, like a particular kind of business (example: insurance agencies; or restaurants.) 

Just one warning: line of business applications are an incredibly saturated market simply because so many developers have been developing solutions for decades. However, there may be opportunities in creating modernized versions of existing applications, such as cloud or server based versions of workstation applications.

**You need to make a plan.** Whether it is a business plan or just a practical written plan, you need something!

You should not necessarily pursue whatever projects are available. You should be willing to be flexible, but there is a line to be drawn.

**The path to sustainable business is finding a few things you do really well**, and doing them. Business will grow naturally. This is assuming you've made sure that the market is there for the service(s) you are offering. When you are providing good services, sales will be natural too.

**Consider what you and your team are passionate about.** When you are doing work you enjoy, you will see better quality, a happier culture, and less turn-over. Don't just think about where you can make money. What is your company about? What kind of work is the best fit for your team?


As far as developing software products, there are pro's and con's. Subscription based software products can allow you to build some stable regular income. However, trying to do much can sink you as well. It is really hard to manage software products and continue doing other projects. The software is a longer term investment and hard to make a priority when the shorter term projects tend to pay the bills, at least initially.
