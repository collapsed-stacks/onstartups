I want to create a "social search engine" website. The idea is for people to search for jobs (or articles, or recipes -- I am necessarily targeting jobs), and be able to **view them on my site**, comment on them, vote on them, share them, etc. An example of this kind of idea is http://www.yummly.com which targets recipes. 

My problem is with the copyright. Do I need to get permission from every site I want to crawl to display their content on my own site -- even if I am linking back to them as the source? If so, how would I go about this?

Also, are there any good ways I can have the social features while still being treated as merely a search engine? (As opposed to "stealing" content.)

<p>Most sites have a file called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard" rel="nofollow">Robots.txt</a>, placed in the site root, that tells which parts of the site you may, or may not, access with non-human behaviour. Also make sure you follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#The_economic_benefit_of_fair_use" rel="nofollow">fair use</a> when you publish content (publish an abstract, always link to the source site etc.). The Electronic Frontier Foundation has <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP" rel="nofollow">some good info</a> on legals.</p>

<p>In some cases you may collect the data using the site's API. Just make sure the Terms of Service, the EULA or whatever agreement covers the API allows for your usage.</p>

If you are doing as google does, just putting a title in the search results and description you are fine.  Just give your site owners the option to verify that they own a domain name and opt out.
