Our business involves developing iPhone/iPad apps now we have a lot of ideas for the apps and we want to develop all of them. Now my problem is Im not sure how we can go about keeping up with each app, support and receive and use the feedback from the users. can and should we outsource this or are there tools out there that can help with this?

Start off simple. Setup a gmail account and set up labels for each app you create. 

I know this is a short answer.. but that's really all you need. 

If you start getting overwhelmed via email, then you may need to look into support software with knowledge bases attached, so you can scale your answers across a large amount of support questions.

Hope this helps!

I found the solution for my app support was to sign up at Get Satisfaction. People know and trust the name and you can have all of their support tools and feedback mechanisms without having to reinvent the wheel.

Agreed with the previous posters.  Build the app and focus on simple user experience.  If you put the work in in the beginning, you'll need less support.  As for getting feedback, I've had really good success with Uservoice.  I set up a uservoice page under feedback.myapplication.com and it's been great for collecting, categorizing, and responding to feedback.
