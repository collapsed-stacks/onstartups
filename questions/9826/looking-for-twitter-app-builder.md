I have a small fun Twitter app idea and I was wondering if there are Twitter app builders such as the ones you can find for iPhone? Similar to [MobileRoadie](http://mobileroadie.com/) or [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/) for Twitter specific for non-programmers.

If there aren't any. Are there good resources of learning how to put a simple Twitter app together?

If you have some knowledge of flash, you can make apps so easily now. You can use Flash Catalyst (basically its same as Flash but it lets you make things without touching any kind of ode) and Flash builder (basically Flash but more complex). It'll be a flash file basically but you can export it as an iphone app or even a desktop app. 

Edit: Let it be known, Flash is awesome. You might think this is easy but you'll make some really, really complex apps from this.

*Some sites where you can learn this* : <br />
Gotoandlearn.com (They make a dummy iphone app even... watch that and you can make apps)
Active.tutsplus.com (A flash tutorial site, it'll help)
