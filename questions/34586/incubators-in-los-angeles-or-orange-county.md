Does anyone know where I could find a (comprehensive) list of start-up incubators around Los Angeles or in Orange County? I already have some connections in the area, but most seem to be oriented towards "social networking" or "e-commerce" which doesn't quite fit our theme (e-sports/gaming).

I've never gone the incubator route before and I'm trying to tread carefully :P If anyone could provide some leads it would be appreciated!

<p>For sure <a href="http://fi.co" rel="nofollow">Founder Institute</a> has a chapter in LA (and one in San Diego as well).</p>
