I am finding it difficult to catch  the best way to find keywords. I have read to use ones that my clients would ask basically in "client language" and I just cannot do it. I try but always end up using terms that I know my clients would not look for a service in that manner. I have used Google Keywords and couldn't really found any keywords that were relevant and  not already  popular that I (as a start-up) have no chance at competing there...yet; anyway.
