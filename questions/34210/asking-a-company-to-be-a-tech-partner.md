I have been on a fruitless search for a technical partner to help me build a web startup.  In the meantime, I went ahead and had the MVP built by an offshore company.  They've done a pretty good job, are very responsive, and I'm pretty happy with them.  

Since my luck with finding a technical person still hasn't turned around, I would like to enter a partnership agreement with the offshore company.

I cannot offer any more funds but I would like to offer them equity.  Also, I will continue my search to find a technical co-founder so I would like to take that into consideration as well when deciding upon the terms.

Since I will be approaching the offshore firm with this idea, I was wondering if I could get the help of the people on this forum with regards to the type of terms I should be thinking about.

Thanks,
LZ

You seem to have successfully navigated the treacherous waters of outsourcing. That's a strong point right there.

If I understand your question properly, you are basically running out of money, so you can't pay the offshore company anymore (at least not at the desired level). Since you are happy with the quality of their work, it's ok for you to switch to a more equity-based compensation. I have no idea if that would be ok for them, though. You need to ask. Usually, the whole point of offshore is to work for cash, equity is just too risky.

You may be able to lower the cash rate by offering equity, so keep an open mind. And just ask them. Be ready to be convincing when they ask you how likely it is that your project will one day generate profits. You are asking them to invest their resources into a highly risky venture.

If you are a US (or other first world) company and you are going to have a substantial portion of your equity owned by a foreign entity be aware that this will have substantial tax and reporting implications.

A reality check: virtually **all** consulting companies are established with the idea of charging fees for their services. I have never, ever seen a consultant or a consulting company that had as part of its business proposition that it was going to work for royalties or equity. 

It is a significant risk to start and run a consulting company. A consulting company that enters into equity agreements is creating compounded risks for themselves. They still need to pay their people to do the work. 

Of course, that is not your problem, but you really need to understand the consulting company's side of the proposition in order to understand why they only work for fees. 

Who knows, maybe you can keep offering and perhaps someone will accept.  But I think ultimately this is a bad - fruitless and pointless - approach. Because it is a bad bet for the consulting company. It would probably only work if the consulting company executives were extremely young and inexperienced. In other words, if they did not understand fully that they need to maintain cash revenues.
