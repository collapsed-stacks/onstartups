So here's the deal..I have a developed product and for the  next few months all I need is someone to support me with a presales call if necessary and or keep my demo and infrastructure going until I can bring in a project. I am not a tecky so I can't do it myself and I don't need someone on a weekly basis right now more on an on call basis..what do you suggest to do here? Other issue is I can't pay consultants in my space $75 hour to work which is what they are asking for..The other problem is if I bring in a project and need someone to start it while we hire..he is the risk as well..

I think an important thing to accept is that not every business is sustainable.  If you need $75/hour talent but your market won't support a profit margin that can pay that rate, you don't have a tenable business.

One option you will consider, I am sure, is to find a way to "work something out" and get a developer that will work for less.  Trust me, if you find someone willing to work for less, there is a reason.  Either they are good, but don't have the time to dedicate or they suck.  In the first case, you are buying "if I am available" time, and in the second case, you are buying a nightmare.

If you haven't already checked into it, you should look at elance.com.  You can post your requirements there and get bids from all over the world, many of which will be in a range you can support.  But again, I think you are going to get what you pay for.

At the end of the day, you need to accept that your business might not be tenable.  I know that is not what you are wanting to hear, but it is better to accept now than 6 months from now after you have spent $ and time you will never get back.    But don't let that make you lose heart... many, many entrepreneurs failed ALOT before they hit the one that works.  Just keep trying.

Go with a part-time programmer; this way you keep the knowledge in-house. This is crucial to my opinion. Consultants won't care for your company as much as an employee.

Later, if things go well, you can hire him full-time.

Post on forums that developers frequent. You may be able to find a stay-at-home mom that will be more than happy to put a few hours of work, as long as it is on her time. The good think about online business is that the developer could be working with you virtually. 

Do it a s contract arrangement basis and short term. You can always renew or extend. If $75/hr sounds too steep, try adding all costs associated with a full-time employee.

You may want to bring someone on at a lesser rate and either increase the rate or pay a bonus contingent on getting the first sale.

Another option is to bring someone in as a partner.
