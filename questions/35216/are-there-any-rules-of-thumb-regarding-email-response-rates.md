I am running a startup and I reached out to an industry publication that I read while I was working for my last employer (for advertising our product with them).  I am interested in their email blast as their readers would be the exact type of person we will be targeting, but I want to see if it makes sense from a monetary standpoint.  They mentioned that they have an average 14% open rate (across a variety of advertisers), but either didn't have or wouldn't share click through rates, etc.  I was wondering if anyone had any experience on email response rates (e.g., is 0.5% reasonable or is it more likely to be 0.1% ... or 1% ... etc.).

In my last job, I worked with marketing a lot and a 0.5% response rate was average (for direct mail) while 0.75% or more was quite good.  But I have a sneaky suspicion that email may be much worse.

<p>Mailchimp's <a href="http://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-benchmarks-by-industry/" rel="nofollow">Email Marketing Benchmarks by Industry</a> should do the trick.</p>

If they are able to detect open rate then you can be sure they have the numbers on click-through rates.  

Reasons for not sharing that information could include:
1. Email click through rates are going to be based in part on the actual content of the message.  It's hard to predict what your click through rate might be compared to another business.

2. They are so low that they don't want to scare you off.

That said, click through rates aren't that important.  What's important are conversions. In other words I couldn't care less about how many people link to my site from google.  However, I am 100% interested in how many buy when coming from google.  Make sense?

If you send 1000 emails and 1 person buys, is that acceptable?  What about if it was 10,000 to 1?  Considering email blasts are extremely cheap it might be a relatively cheap way to get a few clients.
