I want to search the SERP position of my website keywords in google.us. The problem is that when I type google.us it redirects me to google.com. So how to find the position of the keywords in google.us.  Any tool or any other way to find out?
Suggestion would be appreciated...
Thanks

If you want to see how your keywords appear in the US version of google.com, you can sign out of google, clear cookies / disk cache / whatever and enter this URL:

http://www.google.com/search?q=QUERY&gl=us&pws=0

I keep a separate "clean" profile in firefox where cookies and whatnot have never been enabled and I use it only to check rankings.

<p>I'd advise <strong>against</strong> using a software to check your ranking.</p>

<p>It uses your IP address, and two cases can happen :</p>

<ul>
<li>The software will query google at a normal rate and your IP will get banned by Google. That's the worst case scenario because it's your office IP address.</li>
<li>The software will query google at a slowed rate, if you're tracking dozens of keywords it'll take consequent amount of time and the result will be biaised : your IP address is geolocalised and has an history. </li>
<li>Sometimes you'll get CAPTCHA that require human intervention.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest using a SaaS tool, like <a href="http://www.myposeo.com/en/" rel="nofollow">myposeo.com</a>, as it'll use its own IP pool and doesn't take your computer's data, but theirs.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

There is no site google.us. Google owns it and redirect visitors to main site google.com

It's best if you use a software such as rank tracker to check your rankings and record them for meaningful analysis.

And yes there is no google.us :)

<p><strong>Use software to check rankings...</strong>
To be able to select which Google datacenter you are checking you need to use a tool like <a href="http://www.advancedwebranking.com/" rel="nofollow">AWR</a> (AdvancedWebRanking).</p>

<p>This will let you enter a list of keywords you want to track, the search engines you want to monitor and specifically which datacenters you want to query (e.g. Google US).  Furthermore it saves your results so you can trend the data over time.</p>

<p>Note: use of this sort of software is against Google's Terms of Use.</p>

<p>Subnote: everybody does it.</p>

<p>Agree with edralphs comment - software / SaaS is the best way to do this. 
Another alternative - <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/rank-tracker" rel="nofollow">seomoz's</a> tools.  Less chance of getting your ip banned with local tools - allows you to monitor multiple competitor sites over time, and provides good feedback on what changes you should consider.  </p>

<p>Not cheap, but good.</p>
