You can receive remittance from USA as an individual as well as an organisation. As an organization the biggest advantage you will have is, you will be paying taxes after deducting your expenses. The tax will be on the profit you would be making. 

As an individual you will have to pay the taxes on everything you will earn.

Moreover, having a company instills more confidence in the buyers. At the start of business when you have nothing, its mainly about the perception. The way people perceive you or your organization is the way people do business with you. 

Having a company would help you employ people in future. 

Do not worry, registering a company does not require much money. With 12-15k expense you can get a Pvt. Ltd. company registered in India. This cost can vary. As such cost by Govt is around 5k but there are various paper works, Memorandum of Association etc are to be drafted. CAs or Lawyers take their fee in the range of 7-10k to get the company registered.

Bottom line is - having a company is far more advantageous than working as an individual.
