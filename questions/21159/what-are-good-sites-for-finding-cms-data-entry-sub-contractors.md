I prefer to do work on my own sites, but I occasionally take one-off small business website jobs where I work with a designer, who owns the client relationship.  Most of these sites are content management sites where I hand off ownership and maintenance of the content to the designer for posterity - I build the site, hand off a zip file and I am done.

I enjoy the CMS theming/skinning and configuration, but hate the tedium initially populating the content (page text and images), which is something the designer and client want me to do.  I try to dissuade them from this by offering to train them for an hour at my usual rate and then they can do it, or alternatively pay my development rate to do the copy/paste button-click-click-click tedium of putting their content into the CMS (which to me seems like a waste of money...they could hire a high school student to do it for less than $15/hr I would think).

Then I thought I could hire this work out, which gets me to my question:  

What labor marketplaces are best for getting someone to do this piece work:  log into the CMS from wherever, create pages, and populate them with provided text and images.

Mechanical Turk?  or something else?

The solution I decided on is to just hire my 12 year old daughter to do it.  She is fully capable of performing this work, and is looking for ways to earn money to buy an iPad 2.

<p>If I can suggest an alternative, have you ever tried returning a site populated with <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" rel="nofollow">"lorem ipsum"</a> text?</p>

<p>Anytime I have done contractual development on websites I populate lorem ipsum with the correct fonts and headers, then let the client input their own text.</p>
