I would like to know, what operating systems are used for development in startups.
Are startups using

 - Linux
 - Mac OS X
 - Windows

as there Platform. I am talking about inhouse infrastructure, not for their productive
system. Because we want to start a business and I have no idea, how to approach the topic. Linux with Desktop PC may be cheaper, but is Apple in the long run more productive? etc.  

I would appreciate any experiences and informative links/answers.

**Edit:**
I should ad, that it will be a JavaEE application. And we will have a Designer (he will have an Apple).

My advice would to evaluate the tools your business will be dependent on and then get the platform best suited for those tools to develop on. 

IE buying a Windows PC probably isn't the best way to develop a rails application but is best if you're developing an MVC project.

Typically, designers will use a Mac (Photoshop) and programmers will use Windows if developing windows tools or Linux/Mac for everything else (rails,php,python etc)
