<p>I am trying to determine the best way to structure support offerings for obsolete/retired products. We only provide support for customers paying annual maintenance fees, and up to this date we have been supporting all the major releases the company has made. </p>

<p>Other players in our industry have very long mainstream support phases, 5+ years, however at our stage I feel that doing the same would limit our agility. I am considering supporting only the most current and previous major release of the product, but still want to acknowledge that some of our customers may want to remain on an older version for a longer period of time. I would therefore like to introduce an "extended support" plan.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if this "extended support" plan should be something that we provide at extra cost, or at same cost but with some limitations (ex: only showstopper bugs will be fixed). A  <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/rob-addy/2012/03/18/are-extended-support-fees-immoral-and-indefensible/" rel="nofollow">blog bost</a> that I found call such fees "immoral" and "indefensible", and even argues that extended support should be discounted. </p>

<p>At this point, I strongly believe that we should be encouraging customers to stay current but I'm unsure about the best way to achieve it. </p>

<p>On one hand, keeping support staff and developers trained and available for older versions can be costly. On the other hand, customers running older versions are usually very stable and require less support. Increasing maintenance costs for those customers could force them to reevaluate their decision to pay for maintenance. In extreme cases, a customer could start looking for alternate products. Letting customers stay on very old versions forever also has its own drawbacks - eventually, those customers will also stop paying maintenance once they stop seeing any value for it (not upgrading+not using support).</p>

<p>I'm trying to strike the right balance between keeping customers happy, making sure our efforts are not spread across multiple product versions, while maximizing our recurring maintenance revenue.</p>

<p>Do what's right for your business. End-of-life old products, that's completely fine. If a hugely critical bug shows up in an old version and you feel like fixing it, you still can. Just don't commit to it in advance. If you charge money, you will feel obligated to fix it. So just end of life some versions, with reasonable notice, and no reasonable user will be upset.</p>
