I'll try to make this simple: 
I started at my startup over a year ago, apx 6 mos before we raised a second round of funding (helping with this was a big part of my hire), in my offer letter I was told I would receive (Subject to board approval) a number of options. 

A year later (just after my cliff date) and 6 mos after we raised the round, I finally received my options agreement with my vesting commencement date = to my start date, but the grant date being the year later - after the round, after the board finally approved it, and after we were revaluated, so my strike price is approximately 3 x what it would have been had the options been granted at the time of my start date - or even within months after. 

I know multiple coworkers who received their options package within a month of their start date and received the earlier strike price. 

Do I have any legal/compliance/anything ground to get the strike price when I started vs. the year-later, 3x higher price at grant date?

<p>While you should probably talk to a lawyer to get a definitive answer, it looks like you don't have any grounds for complaints.</p>

<p>The grant date is the date of the actual grant, which in your case was a year after the hire. Playing with it may be very costly to the company - read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_backdating" rel="nofollow">backdating and related backdating scandals in the past here</a>.</p>
