Are you assuming that VLC, SMPlayer were created with making profit in mind? 
Because that may not be the case.

In case of VLC Wikipedia writes:
"The VideoLan project was originally started as an academic project in 1996 (....) it is now developed by contributors worldwide and is coordinated by the VideoLAN non-profit organization."
(see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player )

The videoLAN organisation works with volunteer developers and asks for donations for server costs and for organizing events. Some of the VLC developers have set up companies offering services to mone4
ize their experience gained in the project.
(see: http://www.videolan.org/videolan/partners.html )

It seems that profit can be 'bolted on' afterwards by adding services to the product or process for businesses that uses open source software. Most examples are in B2B market.

Business market examples:

1. Red Hat is the example of a company making profit. It adds services to an open source product they assembled. 

2. Drupal's developer raised a company called Aquia that provides services to a limited part of the open source product. This a) gives clients quality assurance and a managable scope of the product and b) gives the open source community its space to initiate and contribute to development. 

3. You can develop closed source software and organize a buy-out to open source it. Examples in this range are Blender and maybe also StarOffice. 

Governement market example:

4. You can use the arguments for open source to win government/EU tenders. This does not necessarely mean that the end product will be open sourced since there are also arguements that governents should not compete with or damage markets. Either way, you will have the advantage of the contacts, the source, the product, the services and the market. Example is DocWorks.

Consumer market example:

5. You can develop for mobile markets. price tag can be less than one dollar so easy to buy (not much too loose) for consumer. profit per product will be determined by number of sales (huge market size) and by time it takes the competition to copy the product and rebrand/remarket it or for you to stay ahead and create community or client base around your product which makes it difficult to compete by simply copying. Examples (not open source by my knowledge): Wordfeud.

Simple answer is they aren't. The work on these projects was donated freely by the programmers. This is not their full time job but a side project

That's not to say that you can't make money from open source projects. Red hat for example makes a huge amount selling support for their free software.
