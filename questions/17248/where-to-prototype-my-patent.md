I am looking for a prototyping company for some of my patents. Does anyone know any good but cheap ones, coming out of China? I've browsed on Alibaba.com but I haven't found anything credible. Has anyone had better luck?

Thanks!

Are we talking about an issued patent or a provisional patent?

Either way, I would be a bit leery of outsourcing a "proof of concept" to the lowest bidder. If the concept is sound, that would give an unscrupulous developer enough access to understand what workarounds would be necessary to create a competitive offering that would not violate the patent. If the patent is provisional, then you give them a leg up in taking the concept, tweak the claims and patenting it themselves.

Sure, sounds a bit alarmist - but ideas are worthless unless something is developed - and since you're outsourcing the development side, you need to be absolutely confident that the outsourced group will not cut and run with your idea.

<p>I think it really depends which domain your patents cater to, I feel there are lot of cost effective providers looking for challenging work but choosing a good one amidst thousands of run of the mill vendors is the real task at hand. If you are also looking at India then there are lot of mailing lists that you can subscribe to and monitor for quality vendors. Some of the mailing lists that would be able to recommend you vendors in India are:</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/punestartups" rel="nofollow">Pune startups mailing list</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/headstart-network" rel="nofollow">Headstart Network</a></p>

<p><a href="http://occbangalore.org/" rel="nofollow">OCC Bangalore</a></p>

<p>These mailing lists are inhabited both by product startups who build for end users and vendors. It will be advisable to form up strong contracts and judge on communication not just on skills before proceeding. </p>
