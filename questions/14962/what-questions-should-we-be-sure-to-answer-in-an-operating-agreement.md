I'm at the point of forming an LLC with a partner, and wondering about questions that aren't obvious but that should definitely be included in an operating agreement.  Questions like,

* What are the conditions under which the company will dissolve?
* How are decisions about company direction / focus resolved?

Anything else?

Thanks!

<p>I recommend you read <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1413310540" rel="nofollow">Form Your Own Limited Liability Company</a> by Nolo. That's what I used when creating our Operating Agreement and it was extremely helpful. The book contains a CD with a fill-in the blank Operating Agreement template you can use.</p>

<p>Here's an outline:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS:</strong> Effective Date; Formation; Name; Registered Office and Agent; Business Purposes; Duration of LLC</li>
<li><strong>MEMBERSHIP PROVISIONS:</strong> Nonliability of Members; Reimbursement for Organizational Costs; Management; Members' Percentage Interests; Membership Voting; Compensation; Members' Meetings; Membership Certificates; Other Business by Members  </li>
<li><strong>TAX AND FINANCIAL PROVISIONS:</strong> Tax Classification of LLC; Tax Year and Accounting Method; Tax Matters Partner; Annual Income Tax Returns and Reports; Bank Accounts; Title to Assets</li>
<li><strong>CAPITAL PROVISIONS:</strong> Capital Contributions by Members; Additional Contributions by Members; Failure to Make Contributions; No Interest on Capital Contributions; Capital Account Bookkeeping; Consent to Capital Contribution Withdrawals and Distributions; Allocations of Profits and Losses; Allocation and Distribution of Cash to Members; Allocation of Noncash Distributions; Allocation and Distribution of Liquidation Proceeds;         </li>
<li><strong>MEMBERSHIP WITHDRAWAL AND TRANSFER PROVISIONS:</strong> Withdrawal of Members; Restrictions on the Transfer of Membership</li>
<li><strong>DISSOLUTION PROVISIONS:</strong> Events That Trigger Dissolution of the LLC</li>
<li><strong>GENERAL PROVISIONS:</strong> Officers; Records; All Necessary Acts; Mediation and Arbitration of Disputes Among Members; Entire Agreement; Severability    </li>
<li><strong>SIGNATURES OF MEMBERS AND SPOUSES:</strong> Execution of Agreement; Consent of Spouses</li>
</ol>

<p>The book doesn't provide a lot of details about Buy-Sell clauses. For that take a look at <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1413311954" rel="nofollow">Business Buyout Agreements</a> by Nolo.</p>

<p>Also, when you have finished creating it, you should have a lawyer review it.</p>
