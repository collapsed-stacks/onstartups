[StartUpAmerica][1] was launched with much fanfare earlier this year by the White House, Steve Case, IBM, the Kaufman Foundation, and others.

Goal is to find ways to help create jobs in the private sector by helping start ups grow. Sounds great! I've seen lots of news reports about events they are holding and partnerships they are announcing but I have not seen much real practical support. 

I've completed the "Contact Us" form on their site twice but never heard anything.

Is this a big PR thing or is anyone really getting value from them. If you're getting value, what are you doing to make this work for you? 

They're active on Twitter @StartUpAmerica

Thanks.

Looks like it's just PR for the time being. Talking about entrepreneurship is one thing - learning how to create a market-worthy product or service is another. Right now the site is simply a bunch of links embedded in links embedded in links. There are no step-by-step instructions as to how to get started nor how to use the "resources provided". At the very least, they should have some user-driven content. A wannapreneur noob would have no idea as to how to use that site.

Onstartups provides way more value.

VC [Fred Wilson](http://avc.com) was [optimistic](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/02/startup-america.html): 

> But this effort gives us an opening. We can get things like visa reform on the White House's agenda through new channels. We can push back on nutty ideas like regulating VC firms so that my blog posts would have to be signed off on a compliance officer before they go public. We can shine a light on areas that need help and those that are doing "just fine, thank you."
