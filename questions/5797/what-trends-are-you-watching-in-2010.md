What are the big trends that you are watching for in 2010?  

They can be relevant to technology, business, your own industry, whatever...

For me...

- The Apple Tablet - 'Tablet PCs done right' could be a [game changer][1].
- The privacy backlash that is brewing against social networks - and the way in which people are wanting to [control their exposure and get a grip on their privacy][2]
- The 'real time' web - tools that go beyond Twitter to bring information, trends, reviews to
   the masses much faster.
- The rise of the small business, home worker, independent consultant, entrepreneur as opposed to people working for the large corporation.  This is a growing meta-market in itself.

What are you watching this year?

1: Ditto the **Apple iSlate**. It's going to change how you buy and read books (kindle for iPhone is a very good reading experience; for the iSlate is will be awesome), subscribe to media (from NYT to People Magazine), how you connect to people (videoconferencing, the Social world). For starters.

2: US/EU will get what Japan has had for years: **the mobile culture**. mobile as payment mechanism, offices without landlines, mobile social and all the rest. If that means AT&T needs to be broken up again to get the service people pay for, so be it.

3: The single broadest software market, IMO, will be **building out all the apps in all the flavors that a post-industrial, work for yourself and get paid for value global economy**. For example, we have 10% unemployment today and a need in the online economy to be able to easily and reliably subcontract work. Someone is going to put that together.
