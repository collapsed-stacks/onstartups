I was trying to find a company in my area who already produces canned food products that would be able to produce mine as well. I would like to be able to concentrate on the rest of the business enterprise. Any suggestions?

<p>Have you tried your chamber of commerce? I would think they'd likely be familiar with companies in your local area that may be able to meet your needs.</p>

<p>The following websites may also be helpful in your research:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.salesgenie.com/" rel="nofollow">Salesgenie.com</a>: Salesgenie.com is the leading provider of fast,
targeted online access to the highest quality sources of business and
consumer sales lead data available for sales professionals. Its
database give you access to 14 million U.S. businesses and 210
million consumers and helps you profile your best customers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.harrisinfo.com/" rel="nofollow">HarrisInfo.com</a>: Harris InfoSource provides a directory of 36,0000
U.S. manufacturers available online, in electronic databases, and in
print.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thomasnet.com/" rel="nofollow">ThomasNet.com</a>: ThomasNet is a comprehensive resource for finding
information on suppliers of industrial products and services in North
America.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dnb.com/" rel="nofollow">DNB.com</a>: Dun &amp; Bradstreet focuses on being one of the world's leading
suppliers of business information, services, and research. Its
database contains statistics on more than 100 million companies in
more than 200 countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>I lifted these from the <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/about/faqs#3" rel="nofollow">FAQ on the US Chamber of Commerce</a> website.</p>
