Say a client wants to add something to their extranet webapp which I'm renting out to them. For any customization, I charge an hourly fee. Do I just give them how many hours I worked?

    New feature X added to intranet webapp
    Billed time = Total 3 hours and 5 min

 Or do I need to break it down and list:

    New feature X added to intranet webapp:

    1) Changed database schema - 30 min
    2) Optimized 5gb databse file - 5 min
    3) Edited PHP files - 2.5 hours

    Billed time = Total 3 hours and 5 min

How does everyone else do this type of billing?

I used to do this type of work and I suggest itemizing what you did, but only at a high level. These are usually the points that you discussed with them in detail. That is, you didn't say I am going to change the database schema, but you would have said something like I will implement feature x.

So your bill should be more like:

> New feature X added to intranet webapp

> Billed time = Total 3 hours and 5 min

It is likely your customer is only interested in what they requested. Only go into detail if they ask you for it. For most customers they are either too large to care about details or don't understand the details, especially when it comes to the invoice.

If it's a small business and you have regular contact it's more likely you can go over these points in discussions either before or after implementation..

`5 min`? You carrying about this short things? Get only in hourly rate like 2,3 or 4 hours not 2,5 or 2 minutes.

It's an *hourly* rate.
In your case I'd put 4 hours.
