I am interested to build a startup. But I need a partner, most probably someone that has the skills that I don't have. I have technical backgrounds in web development and scrum project management. Now it would be great to have someone that can fill in the gaps that I don't have, because I can never be great in everything and because currently I am still working fulltime at a company. Does anybody know a forum that accommodates this?

jpartogi,

1. Check out FairSoftware.net - you'll find people there looking for startup partners.
2. Meetups are an excellent way of finding partners - but somewhat random. I'd suggest that you ask on your blog - and if you don't have a blog, you should.
3. Try tweeting, but think carefully about how you phrase it. Keywords like rails and SaaS will help, but so will being descriptive about what complementary skills you need.

I see you're in Sydney, Australia. Why don't you attend some of these meetups? You should be able to meet a lot of interesting folks that might be your cofounder.

We (tech entrepreneurs) usually have drinks every Friday 6 pm at Grace Hotel (York St). Bar 77. It's an ad-hoc process. Just come and usually there are >10 people there.

You're going to need to tighten that up first. Before looking for a co-founder you really need to sit down and figure out what it is you want to do. "doing a startup" is like "painting a picture" You have to have some idea of what the end is supposed to look like before you start.
