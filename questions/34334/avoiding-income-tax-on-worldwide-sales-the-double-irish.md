Does anyone know more about the "Double Irish" Structure to avoid paying income tax for worldwide profits. 100% of the revenues of my company are made oversees. I export physical products oversees. I am referring to the same structure used by Google and other multinational companies that made the news a while back. How do I set one up for myself?
