I have a few questions regarding equity distribution that I would like to get cleared out, since I am the core developer and CTO of this project and have very little idea on businesses etc.

My Situation is like this -

Founder 1 - Investor 200k, came up with the idea, invests say 25% of his time.

Founder 2 - Developer, no funding, came up with the idea that makes this system unique from other existing ones, invests 50% of his time, and is a final year student.

Founder 3 - Investor 200k, helps develop the idea, has necessary contacts to get this business running very quickly.


I am Founder 2 in this situation.
What would be the idea equity distribution among us.
Currently this is what founder 1 and 3 have in store for me -

Founder 1 and Founder 3 own an LLC 50% each,
this LLC owns 85% of the company that will run the business. and they are offering me 15% non dilutable funds in the daughter company.

I am very new to this and want to know what Im getting into.

Thank you

 1. Separate out the cash contributions from non-cash
 2. Decide how to "price" this initial cash investment (e.g. $400k = 40%)
 3. With the remaining equity (e.g. 60%) decide how much is granted to each of the founders, and how much is reserved for sweat equity vesting over time.  E.g. each founder gets 5% and the remaining 45% is vested over (say) three years.
 4. Now that 100% of the equity is accounted for, you can make room for new investors and employee stock pool by issuing new shares and diluting the initial allotment of equity pro-rata

Unless there is a clear and present reason to create subsidiaries and other legal structure or separate classes of equity, it's a good idea to hold off.  It can always be added later.
