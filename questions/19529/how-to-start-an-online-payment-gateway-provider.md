 - Connections to executives at Visa,
   MasterCard and American Express. As
   no standard merchant agreement will
   allow factoring (processing
   transactions on behalf of another
   entity), you'll need to have your
   entire business supported by the card
   networks themselves.
   
 - You'll need one or more banks to get
   on board to underwrite your accounts.
   
 - You'll need to hire people in each
   country you want to operate in to
   register as a bank, comply with local
   regulations, and bribe local
   officials in countries where that's
   necessary. Yes, in several countries,
   3rd party processors like PayPal are
   considered banks and have to operate
   as such.
   
 - You'll need several hundred thousand
   dollars just to start the process
   rolling, banks won't even let you
   become a normal merchant services
   provider with less than that in
   equity to show, let alone become a
   3rd party processor.
   
 - You'll need to build the best fraud
   detection systems in the world, as
   that's the only reason PayPal is here
   today while their many dot-com-era
   competitors went out of business.
   PayPal was bleeding millions of
   dollars a month to fraud until IGOR
   was operating.

If you're serious, your best bet might be to pitch and chase whatever VCs invested in Square, just to get the benefit of whatever their partners have learned about getting a new payment processor off the ground.
