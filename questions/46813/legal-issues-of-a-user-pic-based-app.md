I'm planning on creating a mobile app based upon the idea of allowing users to take self-portraits and having it shared in a dynamic public gallery (for say, _dating_ purposes, or whatnot). Let's also say there will be application logic that would attempt to filter out any image that doesn't show one's face for more than 75% of the image area, and other potentially objectionable content contrary to my objectives (such as nudity).

Do I have any potential legal (or otherwise) challenges that I need to be aware of and be protected against?

Obviously, I would have to make it abundantly clear that I would require users to explicitly permit the pics they upload to be made public.

But besides that, for someone who is based outside of the US (I am from Manila), what other key steps should I take to ensure that I don't: a) get sued, or b) have my app banned from the Apple / Android market?

"Should I be asking them in advance"?

No of course not. Most people like to have their pictures taken and made public without their knowledge of approval. They'll thank you later.

There are no legal limitations for adults as long as you ask for permission. The question is what you do with abuse? underage use? photographing someone else without his knowledge. You or your company can get into a lot of trouble if you're not protected.

What instagram did legally--- you should probably do to as they allow the same. snapping photos and making them public.
