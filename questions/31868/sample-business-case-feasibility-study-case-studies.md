I'm trying to look at some existing business-cases/feasibility studies to get an idea of what all to include and how to approach it. I'm sure there is no need to reinvent the wheel, but it seems there is a severe paucity of any such things on the net and it's getting really hard to find anything even remotely connected!

I'm basically looking for sample feasibility studies (business cases) especially for software products/services. Any pointers? Books, internet articles all pointers would be good :) The 'free-er' the better ;) I'm more inclined towards 'populated' templates rather than just blank templates. Excel would be excellent :)

I'm just curious to 'study' existing ones or certain samples to help make the one I am currently working on more sound. Yes, I've asked my colleagues and we are working on it too, but I'd also like to do some personal research :)

Here's a tip, when searching google you can add a file filter on the end of the search term to pull up specific types of documents

Word documents:

    "business case" filetype:doc

Excel

    "business case" filetype:xls

The quotes make sure that that phrase is in the document.

You can actually get clever with this and think of terms that may appear in a document 

    "software sales" feasibility filetype:doc

There seems to be loads of stuff available. 

All for free.
