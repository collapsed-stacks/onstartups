For nearly a year, a co-developer and I spent the majority of our time working on a fitness tracking website. We created some neat functionality, but had no idea what we were doing in many other respects. We're now busy with other ventures. The site has about 4000 users.

What can we do with this website? We'd be interested in either selling it or potentially giving it away / transferring it, but it's important any solution isn't too time consuming.

Consider asking your users/community if they want to take it over.

<p>For a non-time consuming sale it has to be <a href="http://Flippa.com" rel="nofollow">Flippa.com</a></p>
