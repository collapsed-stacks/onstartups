I am working with a startup ad agency that has some very large clients for some large, complex projects. 

Many of their projects are subcontracted to other vendors and to crowdsourcing platforms, which makes the management of their invoicing/revenue recognition/etc process pretty complicated. 

Anyone have any ideas for good project accounting software? Thanks much in advance..

Jim

You might want to look at http://www.freshbooks.com/.  They offer invoicing, time tracking and accounting.  They also offer different packages and you can try them out for free.  It's a good choice to get started.

Find an ad agency project management application (with subcontractor capability) that interfaces with an accounting program (Quick Books may be a candidate because of the popularity.). This gives you the best of both tools and minimizes any duplicate data entry.

Quickbooks does have a product line for this.  It is the Quickbooks Contractors version.

it sounds like you are dealing with a lot of different people doing a lot of different things, that all need to be kept track of for accounting purposes.  Without knowing the rest of your system specs, Jeff may have the best advice, which would be to find a local technology expert who specializes in accounting software.  I'd *almost* recommend a Cloud type of alternative which would allow users in multiple locations to update billing, but that may be more hassle in the long run.

Best of luck to you tho, and sorry I couldn't have been more help. I will be curious to see what you decide on.

Check out aACE Accounting/CRM/ERP suite.  The company AGIS, LLC just released version 4 and it is fantastic.

I've worked for them and they are extremely passionate about their product.  aACE can be (and often is) customized to fit very specific workflows.  Check it out, it is totally worth a close look.
