## What do you think about Seo Suites? Are they worth it and are there free alternatives to cover all the aspects?

This is my first question here so I take the opportunity to say hi to all of you!

I'm a mac user and a Seo student :)

At the moment I'm using several tools to check my progress on a particular website, like: senseo firefox extension, website grader, etc.

Unfortunately there is no SEO suite for mac like Webseo or IBP (actually there is one from link-assistant but I'm not a fan of it) to have all the results at glance.

Looking at the price of these programs do you really think they are worth it?
Do you think there are any free alternatives especially for mac users?

Thank you.

Welcome Angelo!

I think everyone is a SEO student - things change so frequently that we all need to keep up with the latest.

I would take a look at SEOMOZ and their online tools ( http://www.seomoz.org/tools ) - linkscape ( http://www.seomoz.org/linkscape ) may be what you are looking for. I find their tools useful & since they are browser based, they should work for you.
