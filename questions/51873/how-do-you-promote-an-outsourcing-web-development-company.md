<p>We do web development outsourcing from Romania. We rarely work with end-user businesses, instead we tried to align our service with companies from western countries that do web development and pass the projects down to us.</p>

<p>We would like to expand our outsourcing efforts and grab more end-user clients. What are the best way to promote our service?</p>

<p>Where the service isn't a web application or some kind or product (no user signups, etc.) like many blogs write about where you could do email marketing, inbound marketing or even raising VC money...</p>

<p>I would say you need to increase your presence on freelancing markets as that is my first port of call when I need to outsource work. You should also have a public, and easy to find, portfolio of your past projects as a proof of work for prospective clients.</p>
