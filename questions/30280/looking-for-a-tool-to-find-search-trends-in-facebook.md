I am looking for an analytics tool Ã  la Google keyword but for Facebook.

I'd like to find info about how many people search for X and Y in Facebook search field.

Is there anything like Google keyword available for Facebook ?

<p>The best you can get is look through blog posts, such as "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=466369142130" rel="nofollow">2010 Memology: Top Status Trends of the Year</a>" but that doesn't give you nearly the power you're looking for.</p>

<p>Facebook used to have a tool called "Lexicon" but they took it down, probably when they realized just how valuable their data is! Too bad, because I wish I could use that too...
