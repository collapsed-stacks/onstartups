## How do I submit a 1096 if I've submitted my 1099s electronically?

I've created and submitted 1099s for my vendors for 2010.  I am now trying to submit the 1096.  All of [the details[(http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1220.pdf) I see from the IRS related to the 1096 submission talks about the paper submission of the 1099, which I didn't use.  It also talks about the deadline of January 31, 2011. However, if submitting 1099s electronically, the deadline is March 31, 2011 (I did send them to my vendors in January).  How can I submit the 1096? Do I just mail it by itself?  Have I already missed the deadline?

A 1096 is a summary form.  You need to submit one for each type of 1099 you issued.  All 1096 forms were supposed to be submitted by the end of February.  

Keep in mind that the 1096 needs to be the official red, scannable form, as supplied by the IRS - and it needs to be mailed in to the IRS.  If you submit one that you downloaded off of the Internet there is a $50 fine.  

We've submitted 1096s late without receiving any penalty, but definitely get it in as quickly as possible.  

Good luck.
