Good Adwords copy is **very easy** to locate. Go to Google and type in any keyword that strikes your fancy. The first 2 or 3 adds get clicked on the most. Thus they have compelling ad copy.

Also look for ads that appear consistently. If you look up a search term and keep refreshing the page you will see some ads that change and some that stay the same. The ones that stay the same are usually ones that are successful for companies - they are using them and not rotating them.

Cheers
