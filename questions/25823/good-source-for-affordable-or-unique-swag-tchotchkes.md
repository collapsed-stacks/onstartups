I have to present and have a table at a conference, and would like to offer some kind of give away.  

Having read a bunch of questions here on swag, I think this one is different.

I am looking for sources to buy swag.  I know of the various t-shirt/shirt/thong printing facilities.  

But for USB keys, mini-mice, flashlights, pens, I am trying to find good sources for small quantities.  I only need about 100.
