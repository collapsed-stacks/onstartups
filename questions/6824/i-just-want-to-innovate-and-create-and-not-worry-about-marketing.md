I just want to innovate and create, and not worry about marketing. How can I achieve this?

I really don't like marketing.

Inbound marketing takes too long and requires lot of content creation. :(

AdSense works but I get so few clicks and I am constantly outbid by some bigger fish.

I don't want to appear rude, but it sounds like you should just get a **job** which allows you to be **innovative and creative**, possibly in someone else's startup.  Without effective marketing, you're never going to build a decent sustainable business, and (to me) you taking the view that it is something you don't want to have anything to do with, means that is exactly what will happen.

Alternatively, as per James's suggestion, if you have some sound innovative, creative ideas that you can develop, find a more marketing oriented co-founder who will care about all this stuff.  But don't think you can just ignore it - in a strange way, **everyone in a start-up is selling** whether they understand it or not.

(Hoping this doesn't come across as too patronising...)

You can just create a webpage and just have a basic explanation of what the product does.

You may get some licensing ideas, but, more importantly, if you have enough innovative solutions then you may find a company that is willing to help with the marketing.

At this point you would just be marketing the fact that you have some innovative solutions.

The other option is to just find someone that is really into marketing, and is willing to be a co-founder, so you can sit in a basement creating new solutions, and they will be doing the hard work of finding clients, of selling the solutions.

You should either get a partner, or hire someone or just give up the entrepreneurship then.  This is not to say that you can't succeed without marketing, but the more fundamental issue is that you seem not to want to take on tasks you are not comfortable with. 

You have to constantly learn and adapt and grow - without that understanding and willingness then you are pretty much set for mediocrity and disappointment.
