Have you found the SBA to be of any value in launching your start up? We used the SCORE program and got some reasonably helpful advice but other than that, haven't seen much value. 

Here's the link to the [SBA][1] and here's the link to the [SCORE team][2].

Are we missing something?

Thanks.

I went to SCORE. The guy was really nice, but he was very old and honestly had no clue about technology or the applications of it. He was very successful at his company previously but all of his advice was the boilerplate stuff ("create a business plan", "Here are bank contacts for a loan", etc.) 

I don't think it was unhelpful, and it probably really matters who you talk to. And, you definitely can't go wrong for the price of FREE. It probably depends a lot on the type of venture you are doing. I have the impression SCORE is more applicable for, say, opening a car wash or a laundromat or some small sole proprietorship brick & mortar entity than for someone with a tech startup looking for VC money.
