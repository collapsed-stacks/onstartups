I am looking for an inexpensive 800-number. I would like to forward it to my cell phone, but get professional sounding voicemail if I don't pick up. (I could change my voicemail message, worst case.)

My goal is to allow users to easily contact me on the phone, without publishing my cell number.

Any recommendations?

<p>I am not sure what you define as inexpensive.</p>

<p>We use <a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/" rel="nofollow">RingCentral</a> for now.  </p>

<p>There are other voip providers, but I am not sure if they have toll free numbers.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://grasshopper.com/" rel="nofollow">Grasshopper</a> for my own business and <a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/" rel="nofollow">RingCentral</a> for my customer's business. They both are fine for what I need but if there was an easy way to move my 800 number to RignCentral I would do that in a heart beat. Grasshopper's portal/dashboard is friggin confusing and real PITA (yes, even the new one!). RingCentral's on the other hand is very intuitive and has lot's of tutorials and walk-throughs.</p>

<p>My advice - go with <a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/" rel="nofollow">RingCentral</a></p>

ANY long distance company can give you an 800 number for about $5-$10 a month. It can ring to any number you tell them, and you can change where it rings (the "Ring To Number," or RTN) whenever you want.

<p><a href="http://www.twilio.com/pricing-signup" rel="nofollow">Twilio</a> has a cloud service - $2 / month for toll free - .05 / minute.  You could use it in conjunction with <a href="http://openvbx.org" rel="nofollow">openvbx</a> and create whatever type of phone system you want.</p>

<p>We've been using <a href="http://www.onebox.com/" rel="nofollow">OneBox</a>, a virtual PBX, at my startup. It's been working well for us over the past two and a half years. I'm not sure how its features and cost compares to other vendors. I haven't gone comparison shopping lately.</p>

You can compare toll free service providers to find the inexpensive and suitable service. 

 - RingCentral 
 - FreedomVOICE 
 - Kall8

If you can afford 800 prefix then fine but usually other prefixes 866, 877 and 888 cost less than 800.
