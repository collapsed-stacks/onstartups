<p><strong>It's not an ebook but...</strong> my favorite so far (especially with startups in mind) is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1118026985" rel="nofollow">The New Rules of Marketing and PR</a>.  Don't shoot yourself in the foot by limiting yourself to ebooks!  </p>

<p>I firmly believe that these days it is much easier for techies to get into marketing purely because a lot of the marketing techniques are getting more techy and online.  Social media, blogging, Adwords, websites... good luck.</p>
