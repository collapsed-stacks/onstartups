<p><strong>Most lawyers don't specialize in a specific company size, they specialize in specific areas of law.</strong></p>

<p>First off you could have mentioned your location. Using a local provider is generally easiest.</p>

<p>Your "Terms of Service" / "Terms of Use" is a harder one, because many different aspects come together in that document -- contract, liability, rights to user generated content including copyright, privacy, and more.</p>

<p>You might want to look at <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/users/1841/dana-shultz">Dana Shultz's answers here</a>; as well as answers <a href="http://www.quora.com/Law?q=law" rel="nofollow">in the law topic on Quora</a>. And especially, ask fellow entrepreneurs in your area which people (people, not firms) they have worked with and would work with again.</p>

<p>This name gets thrown around a lot: Scott Edward Walker, of <a href="http://walkercorporatelaw.com/" rel="nofollow">Walker Corporate Law</a>.</p>
