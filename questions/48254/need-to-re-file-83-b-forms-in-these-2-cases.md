## Need to re-file 83(b) forms in these 2 cases?

I filed 2 83(b) forms and am thinking that I may need to mail an additional copy of each one to the IRS to ensure that they're received and processed correctly:

(1) I mailed one that was to go certified mail, and the envelope had a return receipt attached to it.  However, the postage that was paid for was only for certified mail, no return receipt, and the certified mail tracking number can't be tracked; the USPS website states that no information is available.  

Should I mail another copy of this one with a return receipt as well?

(2) I mailed another one for a foreign person who is in the process of getting a visa.  He isn't yet working in the US, but he will be, and so I mailed it to the IRS address for the state where he will be paying US income taxes--not the IRS address for foreign tax returns.

Should I mail another copy of this one to the IRS address for foreign tax returns?

Thanks!

You have to attach the form to the tax return *as well*, for the year in which you filed it.

The USPS can track the certified mail and tell you if and when it was delivered. If you can't track on-line - call them. That's the whole point of the certified mail.

This should be done properly and with an assistance of a EA/CPA verse in the taxation of non-residents. I'm not sure the way you did it is a correct way.
