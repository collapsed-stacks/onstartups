<p>I am co-founding a startup and sometimes I talk to people that know (direct or indirect) competitors personally.  On the one hand it's great to network, and get to know the market.  On the other hand, maybe the competitor could become aggressive once being aware of us.  How can we deal with that?</p>

<p>Not to worry. In my opinion, don't share strategic plans during networking sessions. Nevertheless, I think it doesn't hurts to let your competitors know about you. If you are or will be making some 'noises' in the industry, your competitors will sure to know about you sooner or later.</p>
