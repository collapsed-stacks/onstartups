Should an entrepreneur pitch investors from other countries to invest in his venture? Are VCs actually interested in these kind of opportunities or it is expected to be a waste of time?

Are you in a country without any or with very few VCs?  If so, maybe, but if not, stick with your own country.  VC funding is complex enough without having to deal with a foreign country with different laws and perhaps different expectations of the investors.  You are more likely to get ripped off as well.  If something goes wrong, you'd probably have to sue in the foreign country.
