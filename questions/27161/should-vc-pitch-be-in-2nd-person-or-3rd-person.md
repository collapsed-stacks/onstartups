Should business ideas pitched to venture capitalists be narrated in 2nd person or 3rd person?

One does not actually sell the product/service to the VC, but in a sense it does "sell" the whole business idea. 

So, should one use:

"NewCorp enables you to do unthinkable things in a matter of minutes.."

or

"NewCorp enables users to do unthinkable things in a matter of minutes.."?

* It doesn't matter.
* It makes no difference.
* Either one is OK.

IF you think your service is something they might personally use:

"NewCorp enables you to do unthinkable things in a matter of minutes.."

If not:

"NewCorp enables users to do unthinkable things in a matter of minutes.."?
