## Is this break down of startups by stage normal?

Ran across this breakdown of startups applications (roughly 7000 "startups" in the database) that appears to show that less than 10% of startups looking for funding have any revenue. Seems hard to believe, is this anywhere near close to accurate?

I wouldn't be surprised by that.  People are getting ridiculous valuations, it would be very hard to achieve that if you did have revenue.  Once you have revenue, you can no longer use silly metrics to estimate your revenue, you actually just have revenue and it's probably somewhat underwhelming compared to the projections you can make up. 

There are also a lot of start-ups that aren't trying to get revenue, they are trying to get funding.  They are two very different things.

I think your information sounds realistic, but it's also an indication of what is wrong with startups, vc's and funding these days.
