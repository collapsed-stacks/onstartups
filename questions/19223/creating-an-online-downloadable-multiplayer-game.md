I have a concept for an online multiplayer game which would require the user to download a lobby interface to access the online content. I am looking for advice for where to look for people who would be able to write this software.Also how do I go about protecting my idea.

Thanks

All you really need to do is find a freelance site for developers. I would at <a href="http://www.odesk.com">oDesk</a>, <a href="http://www.guru.com">Guru</a>, <a href="http://www.scriptlance.com">ScriptLance</a> and <a href="http://www.elance.com">Elance</a>. If you need somebody local, you can always check <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a>, although the more specialized help you need the less likely you will find the quality on Craigslist. 

To protect your idea, I would just be as vague as possible in public areas and let the developers know more about the idea if they email/message you.
