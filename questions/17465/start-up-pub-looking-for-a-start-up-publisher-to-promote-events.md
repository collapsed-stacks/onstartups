I have a new pub in downtown Miami: Pub One. I am lining up some live music acts, but I am constrained by a tight budget. The conventional avenues for advertising are expensive and my Facebook page has, understandably, few fans and all of my friends there are not people who would go to a pub in Downtown Miami. I am looking to see if there is a start-up with a nifty answer to this (as they always do). Some have suggested a local website which is getting good attention in Miami: www.isoplanit.com.

These guys are an event aggregator...a Craigslist of events if you will. What other answers do you have?

You could try find a sponsor to the live act, which I am assuming are local smaller bands. Hence the sponsor pays for the act, but they get to market their product within your pub with whatever you agree with them. It could include say posters or whatever other material they give you to advertise. The trick of course if finding the right sponsor who wants to be associated with live events and to get their product out there. For instance, if your pub is not tied to a major brewery, source a local craft beer and offer to sell their beer in your pub and to advertise for them in your pub, and get them to sponsor, or part sponsor, the live act. They will make money off beer sales, as will you, and you get your live act for free, or a largely reduced rate.

Or just start with people who come into the pub, some of them might own businesses and want to advertise their product and might be seen as a relatively inexpensive way for them to do this.

The acts you hire need to be able to bring some fans with them or what's the point? They have to be able to pay their own way. Otherwise, just have open mike night. 

These friends need to get over it and all hop in a car and go to your place.

I agree with Byron's response (even though this is an old thread and you may have already dealt with the matter): find some way to promote your new pub with an event of some kind - maybe a benefit - that will spread buzz quickly and earn some street cred. It may not be a barn burner, but create a launch party or something (as Byron said, find a microbrewery to help fund it - with giveaways, cash for paying the acts or advertising etc - in return for an opportunity to expand their brand etc) that will act as the catalyst for future events or promos. Make it a theme night, or stir up a little rumor mill about a 'secret' headliner etc. build some buzz, and don't forget to follow it up with some phone calls (or a newspaper ad thanking patrons for a successful launch?) to show your appreciation for everyone's participation.
