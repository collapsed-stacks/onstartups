I'm looking for more great software tools *(than the ones listed below that I already use)* to not only create and run a website, but to verify and maintain it. All our websites run on Unix servers with php. We use:

 1. [TopStyle][1] to create and edit html and CSS web pages.
 2. [Zoom][2] website search engine. You define the output look, search algorithm, and more.
 3. [FTP Voyager][3] for file ftp work.
 4. [HTML Validator][4] to verify the html and CSS code are technically correct.
 5. [Xenu][5] link validator - verifies every link, image, etc on your web site. Reports broken or missing links, redirected, etc. Worst graphics and user interface ever, but it is free, accurate, and fast.
 6. [Instant Demo][6] Creates professional flash application tutorials for your web site.
 7. [Web Log Storming][7] Web site log analysis.

What tools do you use? Do they have any quirks? These are the minimum tools I think are necessary (not including a graphics editor) needed by any startup with a web site- assuming they are PC based.

My must haves are:

 1. Emacs for editing HTML/CSS/JS.
 2. Firebug for debugging all of the above.
 3. W3C HTML/CSS validators.
 4. Selenium for automated front-end testing.
 5. Rsync for file transfers.
 6. Gimp for image editing.

Honorable mentions are:

 2. Firefox cookie swap plugin for easily changing between various test user accounts and admin accounts.
 3. Firefox MeasureIt and ColorZilla plugins for web design tasks.

I use a text editor(Scite) for HTML. Gimp/Inkscape for images.
WebDeveloper plugin for Firefox for basic HTML tuning and validation.
WordPress for content management.
