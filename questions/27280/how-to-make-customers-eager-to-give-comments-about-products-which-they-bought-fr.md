I have an online store which sells baby products. Thankfully, some customers have already bought my products, although my startup is just 2 months old. One of my plans is to make my customers come back and give comments about the products/services of my online store, but I don't know how to go about this. How can I make my customers eager to come back to leave comments in my online store? 

Thanks in advance.

  Being an online store, You are in a unique position, Your customer has given you the contact information, and given you permission to send them emails (Not SPAM).

  Use every chance you get to communicate to your customer.

 - A email that the order is confirmed
 - A email that the order is being packed
 - A email that the order is shipped
 - A email that the order is about to be delivered
   - (Parcel companies generally do this, You can, if you want to)
 - A email that the order is delivered
 - A email Thanking them for the purchase, and come back to being helped more
 - A email, One week after, of how the product is working, and to let you know of issues, concerns, and in general any status..
 - No more emails after that, Your permission expired here.
   - Unless, you have in express writing, that this customer wants to hear from your SPAM.

 - After the feedback is provided, Now ask your customer to receive other comments on the same product, (This is your permission, to include a footer on every email to add personalised signatures, promotions)

Use every communication email, as your source or feedback request. Provide easy links (No registration, if possible), have the email id, order number or any context information in the link, it self. This shows to the customer, that you are personal about their order. The easier the process of providing feedback, the better you get.

Some turn offs

  - Register / Login to comment
  - Scrolling thru screens, before finding the feedback link
  - No context provided, on why I am providing the feedback (Context better be on the same page)
  -

uhm... ask them to :P 

If you have ever bought anything from ebay, they send you an email about a week later, asking you to rate the product and the seller. You can do pretty much the same thing for your own store.

Also, a local online retailer here offers incentives for leaving product reviews - the best ones receive 2â‚¬ on their account per review. And if you dont want to give out money, there are still many other ways to incentivise UGC.

I suggest offering a discount coupon for their next purchase if your approve the review. On the review fields, request their email so you can look up the order and send their coupon.
