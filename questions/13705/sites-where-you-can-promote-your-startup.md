What are the best sites or blogs to freely promote or prompt reviews for your new startup?

(Except well-know sites like TechCrunch, ReadWriteWeb, and so on ... or other sites where you don't have a chance without a well-known name behind you.)

<p>Try <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">Hackernews</a> and also promote it yourself by creating a page in Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, OnStartups, etc... There is also a project I am working on called, the tech map where we intend to map all tech startups in the US, check it out <a href="http://thetechmap.com" rel="nofollow">http://thetechmap.com</a></p>

<p>Also, a good way to promote your site is to participate in blogs by leaving comments (intelligent comments not just links to your site) making sure you have your site address in your profile.</p>

<p>I am the founder of StartUpLift and invite you to submit your site to <a href="http://startuplift.com">StartUpLift</a> where you can get your startup featured (free) and optionally, solicit feedback from our community of users. You may view an example here: http: //startuplift.com/toms-planner-surprisingly-easy-project-planning/.</p>

<p>Also try guest posts on blogs that get a decent amount of traffic and already target your audience.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/" rel="nofollow">Reddit</a> is also another good place to promote your site. See <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/12405/digg-vs-reddit-for-promoting-a-blog-post/12410#12410">Digg vs. Reddit for promoting a blog post</a></p>

<p>There are a number of websites that incessantly profile tech startups and new web apps such as <a href="http://killerstartups.com" rel="nofollow">KillerStartups</a>, <a href="http://venturebin.com" rel="nofollow">Venture Bin</a>, and <a href="http://diystartupnews.com/" rel="nofollow">DIY Startup News</a>.  There are more, but their names escape me at the moment.</p>

<p>If you are actually looking to go beyond just another pageview and gain users, simply approach the bloggers/influencers relevant to the market your startup serves.</p>

Springwise.com is a fabulous site that profiles innovative new businesses, and not only website or tech related businesses. I hope to have my business profiled there someday.

However, I haven't yet looked into how to get selected by them for profiling. So let us know if you find any good tips for getting on the site. Trish

<p>I found a service called <a href="http://www.magicalmofo.com/" rel="nofollow">Magical Mofo</a> the other day, they submit your site to 20 startup sites (like killerstartups, startuplift, etc.) for 9 bucks. 
I Haven't tried it but seems like it would be worth it for the time savings. I'm going to try it for my own launch next week so I'll report back.</p>

<p>There is a service called Rate My Startup (<a href="http://ratemystartup.com/" rel="nofollow">link text</a>) that I used to get more traffic to my site. The community on there also rated my startup as a 9.2 out of 10 so I was featured on the home page for about a month.</p>

<p>Not the size of a ReadWriteWeb but it's much easier to get featured on their home page.</p>

<p>I am actually the founder of <a href="http://ratemystartup.com/" rel="nofollow">Rate My Startup</a> and I saw traffic coming from this post so I came here to reply. (Thanks a lot for the comment Karen!)</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend Rate My Startup (obviously) as well as some other great sites such as Hacker News, Killer Startups, Feedmyapp and Great Web Apps</p>

<p>A lot of the more mainstream sites (Digg, Reddit, etc) are difficult to get to the homepage of. The smaller sites like the ones listed above will normally provide a good amount of traffic for any quality web startups. Also, I would recommend using these sites as a way to get feedback on your startup.</p>

You could check http://startups.alltop.com/ there are sites listed here where you could also submit your startup information. 

Once you find sites that you could submit your startup you could also use similarsite.com to find other website where you could submit your startup.

I guess what should be done is first reach your target community not to VC...
it is always better to get some users first...

I tried all above but community sites worked better.
