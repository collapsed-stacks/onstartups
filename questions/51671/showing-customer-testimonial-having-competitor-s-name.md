<p>On our website we list all customer testimonials.</p>

<p>Some customers provide good feedback/review about our product which sometimes contains comparison with another competitor.</p>

<p>Is it OK to use those testimonials on our website?</p>

<p>Yes, as long as you haven't modified their testimonial without their approval just to make a good comparison for your business.</p>

<p>Yes. I believe testimonials that contains your competitors will not do any harm to your businesses. That is provided if the comparison is to your advantage.</p>
