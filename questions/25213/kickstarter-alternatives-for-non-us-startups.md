I've recently been looking into getting funding for my startup (we're building a web-based social platform). I've looked into www.kickstarter.com and it looks pretty cool however it is only open to US startups.

Does anyone know if there is any websites like KickStarter which allows funding to non-US people?

<p>Crowdfunding in Europe:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Germany</strong>: <a href="https://www.seedmatch.de/" rel="nofollow">Seedmatch</a>, <a href="http://innovestment.de/" rel="nofollow">Innovest</a> (up to 100k) and <a href="http://de.bergfuerst.com/" rel="nofollow">Bergf√ºrst</a> (not seeding, but for growth: from 1m )</li>
<li><strong>Swiss</strong> <a href="http://www.c-crowd.com/en/home/" rel="nofollow">c-crowd</a></li>
<li>German Startup Conference for and with Investors - <a href="http://www.amiando.com/exceed2012.html" rel="nofollow">Exceed</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All those links are investor related, for those who are willing to share their company rather than ask for money (like Kickstarter do)</p>

<p>edit: Now (late 2012), Seedmatch is for more than 100k due to changes in the contract.</p>
