I am currently building an SaaS with freemium business model. For that part I would need to have a company which would receive recurring billing. Since this is the first time I am creating a company and on the internet lot of people is recommending Hong Kong for doing it. So my question is how much would this costs if I am coming from europe?
First are the registration costs. Since I am coming from Slovenia, europe. It is not close location to go there and open a company. 

- I am wondering how much does it costs to have a company which assists you to setup one, any website to those companies are welcomed. How much does it usually costs totally with registration costs + company assistance
- Is there requirement to have address location in Hong Kong and if this is possible to have a virtual address and what are the prices.
- The next step is that I also need a bank account for the company, can this be solved online? Also is there any requirement for minimum funds deposited at the beginning
- Do I need to have a local representative over there for the company and how much does it cost to setup this.
- I probably need also some local accounting company. What are their usual rates. Are they charging flat fee or per number of invoices sent. This is important since there will be mostly subscriptions in range from 8-18 USD.
- Are there any funds I can apply to subsidize for this part since this is going to be tech company or just at the beginning.

So how much would I need to pay altogether to setup a company? And what would be the minimum yearly operating costs running it there?

In the first year I probably won't earn much only few thousands USD, but in the following years it should be around 14000 USD based on most pessimistic calculations. If the business take off I am might willing to relocate to Hong Kong also. Would this affect to any of this parts?

It is very cheap to setup in HK as we promote simplicity here, even the tax rate is flat and assessment is simple. The initial setup will not cost more 1k USD.

U need to sign on a true copy for the documents to reg if u are not coming to HK. For bank some bank provide video conf in their overseas branch, e.g. HSBC in Europe could help.

For address it will cost u 15 USD to get a virtual office here to post and reg purpose.
