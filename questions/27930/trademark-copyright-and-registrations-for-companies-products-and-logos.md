Let's say we have a company called ParentCompany (www.parentcompany.com)

That company has 3 products called P1, P2 and P3 (www.p1.com, www.p2.com, and www.p3.com)

The company and each of its products have their own logos.

The company is software based and is aspiring to do business in more than one country.

What is the best way to register/copyright/trademark this company and it's products & logos?

Is it fine if we simply add "© 2011, Parent Company" in the footer of the company and the products websites. 

Thanks in advance!

<p><strong>Trademark</strong></p>

<p>You want to establish trademark rights to your company and product names.  To do this in the U.S., you simply use the names in commerce.  Other countries require registrations.  In the U.S., you can also add a TM superscript to the end of your trademark to give others notice of your trademark rights.  In the U.S. and other countries you can also apply for a trademark registration, but you have to do this in each country separately.  Only after you get a trademark registration can you use the (R) symbol after the mark.  Here are some <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/faq/trademarks.jsp#_Toc275426681" rel="nofollow">reasons to register a trademark in the US</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>

<p>Unless you are publishing books, music, or the like, most people don't bother to get copyright registrations.  What is it that you want to copyright?  The text of the web page, your source code, something else?  You should add "© 2011, Parent Company" to each thing that you want to claim copyright for.  Note that you can't copyright a trademark.</p>
