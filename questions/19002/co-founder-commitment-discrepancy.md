I am the co-founder of a start-up and my partner was committed for the first 5 months, then decided to take a job and was intermittently involved.  My interest is to advance the technology and boot-strap the business, whereas his interest has been to raise money (unsuccessfully) so that he could quit is job and jump in at a salary that ensures that he meets his family's life style.  We have equal equity and I find this increasingly unfair as I am doing all the work, taking the risks and sacrificing my livelihood to make it work as he stands by waiting for the business to take off.  He also acts as if he was committed and tries to impose his diminishing importance to justify his equity.  Basically I now have over 5 committed people who work on sweat equity and sales commission.  I now need to find a way to increase the equity of the people who are actually performing work (including myself).  What do you recommend?  Can I have a board meeting with a majority voting the issuance of shares (we are an LLC) for sweat, thus starting to dissolve a co-founder who clearly is trying to ride on our coattails.

We cannot tell you what your options are. It depends on the **specifics of the contracts, company bylaws, shareholder's agreements and other documents** created when the company was formed. **You must bring these to a lawyer and ask him.**

Before you go see a lawyer, sit down and read through the papers you signed a couple of times. If these agreements are well made, the will have clauses that stipulate in part or in full how termination, issuing of new shares, etc are to be handled. Read up on this, so that you have a basic idea of it before spending billable hours at the lawyer's office.

People and circumstances change and legal agreements neither change nor are able to deal with all possible future permutations. 

The best remedy is communication. Figure out exactly what his responsibilities and contributions should be, agree them and make them stick. 

If it is clear that these obligations can't be met it will be painfully obvious to both parties and a negotiated settlement can be reached. 

Otherwise, get the legal guns blazing and kick them out.

You could just abandon the entity your partner has a stake in and start a new one, shifting all working members to it. That is if you don't have any contractual obligations to the current entity or he owns any critical IP that prevents you from starting a new entity.

Addendum: Yes, you could also dilute his ownership by issuing more shares to contributing members with a board meeting (in compliance with your bylaws) via a majority vote.
