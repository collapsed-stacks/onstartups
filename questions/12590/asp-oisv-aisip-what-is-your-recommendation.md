For a new uISV, what is your recommendation? 

I cannot access any of these (yet), to judge myself, but would like to hear your oppinion (those who are/were members).

Should I consider becoming member of any of these organizations? 
If *yes*, where and why?  
Any other organization not mentioned here worth to consider?

Thanks in advance for your time and your advice.

<p>First, I'm a member of all three associations.</p>

<p>There is only <strong>one</strong> active MicroISV association, the ASP. Their newsgroups get 75 - 150 posts a day. They have separate technical, marketing, and general interest newsgroups. If you have virtually any question about MicroISVs you can get it answered there. It does cost $100 / year to join.</p>

<p>The AISIP is more-or-less dead. I posted the only new message there in the last week. (It charges a fee to join.)</p>

<p>The OISV is also very limited. It has a few posts per week. (It's free.)</p>

<p>For a crash course in Internet marketing, Adwords, Web site optimization, SEO, selling software on Amazon, and much more- come to the 20th Annual <strong>Software Industry Conference</strong> in Dallas TX next week. (July 15 - 17). It gives you a chance to meet all the major e-commerce and other MicroISV service providers and network with your peers. You can learn more there than in a year on line.
