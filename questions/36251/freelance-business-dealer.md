I have software that is in demand and some company wants to buy it from US. As I am outside US and have never made a business deal in the past, I think I am going to get a bad deal by selling it for less than what it is worth.

I thought hiring a freelance business dealer would be the best choice. Are there experienced freelance business dealers in US? What do they charge? I think I can pay them 20% of the whole deal.

Maybe you should work with a lawyer to help you get the best deal. I don't think it's necessary to have someone based in the United States to complete the deal. If you're looking for someone who is familiar with business in the United States who can advise you on pricing, that can be a good reason. But then you would have to trust someone who you aren't working with face-to-face.
