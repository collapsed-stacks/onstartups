We recently launched a coupon site and we are looking for some free publicity. What is the best way to get publicity on the web. We are working on improving our SEO. Do Press Releases still help these days?

I've tried the 'free' press releases, and they do pretty much next to nothing.  On the other hand, I don't believe they can hurt your exposure.

The only way to get 'good' publicity is by putting forth the effort into...
- blogs
- cross posting blogs
- writing good press releases and publishing them at sites which actually have a connection to your line of business
- posting to newsgroups which appeal to your business domain (where it's allowed)

Use google alerts to alert you when a newsgroup/blog has posted something in your business domain.  Check the alerts (in google reader) periodically to see when something appropriate has been posted, and go post a reply or comment.  If you hit a blog post or newsgroup post which turns out to be popular, and your reply/comment corresponds to the post and gives good information, you may get a lot of good visits to your site.  Don't, however, just post to be drawing attention to yourself or your site.  This is considered very bad taste.

The sky is the limit - I can think of a bunch of ideas - but most will involve your time.

- Go to store locations for the coupons you have (physical stores) ans set up a wireless laptop link.  Show people that you can save them some money.  I understand you are promoting online purchasing, but these people will then check out your site when you get home.  
You might get some buzz there.

- Offer money or merchandise or a gift card for the people who tweet the most or drive the most traffic to your site via some other method.

- Any other kind of "give-away" deal for driving traffic and using your links would help.  

You can start with small numbers of people and slowly grow your customer base.

The best way is through Facebook marketing beacuse millions of people are out there. You just have to do is start a Facebook page and then promote it with your site's URL. Twitter and Linkedin marketing is also effective.
Second thing is that you have to keep updating your Facebook page along with the new offers and benefits. And the best thing is that it's free of cost and it will be more effective than press release.
