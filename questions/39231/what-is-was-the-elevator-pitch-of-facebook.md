What was the elevator pitch of Facebook when it started?  

Is there any good accurate description for Facebook?

Is there a current one for Facebook?

A short summary of what they do can be found everywhere written in different words. 

If you are asking it to benchmark your pitch then most likely this will be a very difficult question to answer. Probably their "pitches" have been changed/adapted many times and often depends on the context (for example we don't use the same terminology for investors than for prospective customers or talking to relatives). 

Personally I think the best source are interviews or chats with founders or top executives, where they explain the business to the readers/audience. Try to find interviews from the early days so you can compare how much they changed the way of pitching their business.
