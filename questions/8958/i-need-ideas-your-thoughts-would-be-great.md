So I have this domain called bargainstomper.com and I have been thinking all weekend about how to monetise the site. I came up with various ideas, like tech reviews leading to amazon affil links, hosting landing pages for clickbank products, becoming a coupon site etc. I think all these have a lot of tough competition at present and getting rankings in a short period would be quite difficult. 

What are your thoughts, what sort of thing would you expect to see at bargainstomper and how could you monetise it?

Cheers,
Marc

<p>I'd build a better version of <a href="http://dodtracker.com/" rel="nofollow">Deal Of The Day Tracker</a>. Identify three categories with the highest / quickest growing online retail consumption (e.g. consumer electronics, home goods, and software), and aggregate deals for them. The idea is to provide continuous novelty, without overwhelming a consumer with choices. </p>

<p>I'd make each category a subdomain (electronics.bargainstomper.com, home.bargainstomper.com, etc.) and offer 1 prominent new deal each day, two less-prominent deals, and a text link to a "more" section / archive.</p>

<p>I wouldn't aggregate just deals-each-day sites like woot.com and midnightbox.com either; I'd monitor <a href="http://freestuffpage.com/forums/showthread.php?t=7637" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a>'s, <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/clearance/" rel="nofollow">ThinkGeek.com</a>'s, and <a href="http://www.walmart.com/cp/Clearance-Savings/45183" rel="nofollow">WalMart.com</a>'s clearance &amp; specials sections. Not every site has an affiliate program; that's okay. Enough do that I think it'd make a good profit for about an hour's worth of work each morning categorizing &amp; adding new deals.</p>

<p>Contact me if you're interested in this idea, and would want additional help with it, Marc. My e-mail's in my profile. :-)</p>
