I have been working with a start up without pay for the last 8 months. 

I have been a senior sales executive with tier one companies for the past 20 years. My position is to build and manage all sales and revenue functions within the company. My colleague will be the CEO. 

The founder has two investors who have contributed $220,000 in seed money. It is a bootstrapped operation. Although we have not contributed hard cash, both my colleague and I have contributed considerable time and risk to help get this company on it's feet.  We are in the process of finalizing employment contracts and are trying to understand what equity percentages are appropriate for our investment and the degree of risk we have undertaken. Starting salaries will be minimal (approximately 1/3 of customary) until we have supporting cash flows which will be at least another year.

Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

<p>Fred Wilson of Unions Square Ventures (investors in Stack Exchange, Twitter, Zynga, Feedburner, etc) have written well about <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/11/employee-equity-how-much.html">employee equity here</a> and employee <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/10/employee-equity-dilution.html">equity dilution here</a>.</p>

<p>Commonly startups will set aside <strong>5-10% pre-Series A stock</strong> to divide among early employees and key hires.</p>

<p>I've adressed this question before <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/17648/how-much-in-stock-options-should-we-offer-new-employees/17653#17653">here</a>.</p>

<p>Edit: As Jesper points out in the comments, this hardly covers the case where someone has gone without salary for months, and then to work for a very low pay. That sounds much more like a co-founder and obviously deserves more.</p>

I think you can base your contribution to the startup on how much money you would be making in a regular company.

You should consider:

 - Money you could've made working in a regular company for 8 months.
 - The difference between 1 year of customary salaries and 1 year of minimal salaries.

Once you know your contribution equivalent in cash, see how much it is of the total percent:

 - $220k.
 - Your colleague contribution equivalent in cash.
 - Your contribution equivalent in cash.

There might be other things to consider like how vital you are for the company's success and other details.

I'm not sure why you can't convert your time into equivalent cash investment.  Taking a salary of $0 is nearly the same as taking a market salary, but investing the equivalent amount into the company.  Every dollar you forgo in salary is one less dollar needed for investment.
