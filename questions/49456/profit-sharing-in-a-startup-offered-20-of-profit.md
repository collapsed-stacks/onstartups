I've been offered 20% of the profit of a new startup if I build the website (which is essential to the business).  What types of things should I look for in the agreement that is to be drawn up?

20% of profits? Let's say the company generates $1,000 of revenue but that expenses are $990: profits are therefore $10 and you'd get $2. What if the revenue grows to $50,000 but that the expenses also grow to $49,990? Same thing: profit of $10 and you'd get $2. **In a startup, profits are supposed to be reinvested to fund revenue growth** so startups usually don't have profits at the beginning.

Rather than a percentage of profits, I'd suggest an incentive based on a percentage of revenue so that the better the company does, the higher your reward becomes. So for instance, you could ask for 1% of the revenue: 1% of $1,000 would be $10 of income for you and then if the company is successful and grows its revenue to $50,000 you'd earn $500. **So my recommendation regarding the incentive is to change to revenue sharing and to tweak the numbers so they make sense.** For instance, you don't want to be greedy and take too much of the revenue because that could then prevent the company from funding its growth.

Good luck.
