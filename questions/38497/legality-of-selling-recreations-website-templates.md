I've been doing webdesign for a couple of years now and I really enjoy designing the initial layout for my pages.  That being said, I've also had some fun projects were I created "look a-likes" of popular sites such as Facebook and a few others.  

Assuming I started my own webdesign template store, would I be able to sell these 'mimics'?  How much different from a site does it have to be?  In these mimics, by the way, I never use images from their site, I always recreate them myself from scratch.

Thanks!

It depends. If your recreation of the images is really close to an exact copy - it could still be copyright infringement.

Beyond copyright - you could also have a trade dress infringement problem. If the site confuses people into thinking they are at the original site, you could run into problems.

Personally, I would stay away from any business model that is built on mimicking someone else's images and look and feel.
