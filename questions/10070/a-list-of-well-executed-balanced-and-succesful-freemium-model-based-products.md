What products do you know of, products that have a Freemium model implemented well and successfully - meaning that there is significant count of paying customers in opposition to the count of freeloading users. And where the income customers generate is higher than overall costs - meaning it's already making money (not just promising).

I'm not interested in Ad based products just the ones where freeloading users are the means to generate networks effect and attract customers.
