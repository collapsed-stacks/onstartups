I have decided to start advertising for my product before it launches. I need a landing page that will collect email and other info.

I have hosting, but I don't yet have a domain. I was thinking of using Google sites for the landing page. Are there any better ideas?

For email and info collection I was going to create my own form... Is there a more professional (and free or cheap) way to do this?

Thanks

Get a domain and use it for your landing page and contact form. 

You'll need a domain at product launch. It takes time for new domains to get established and visible in the search engines. The small amount of money you invest in the domain to promote your product now will help you start with a professional image and establish your domain with the search engines at the time of launch.

Aside from what Keith said- advertising is all about promoting your **brand**. Until you have a domain you don't have a **brand**! You would be wasting your advertising money spening it without a domain. Buy one **now**.

<p>Once you have your domain, you can buy a contact template from someone like <a href="http://themeforest.net/" rel="nofollow">Theme Forest</a>. You can try and do one on your own, but for somewhere in the region of $10 you can get one that will look very professional.</p>

<p>For professional looking contact forms use our free service: <a href="http://www.jotform.com" rel="nofollow">JotForm</a>. Unlike all other similar services, JotForm does not add logo, "powered by" or "report abuse" kind of links on forms on free accounts. So, it would be the most professional looking solution for your needs.  </p>

<p>In addition to contact forms, you can also create email signup forms or feedback buttons on your landing page. </p>

<p>If you have any questions feel free to email me.</p>

For email, you should use email clients like MadMimi or Mailchimp (those are the ones I know that lets you have a mailing list for the first 100 emails without paying for anything. And they're pretty cheap after that). 

They let you generate an opt-in box and you can paste the code in your landing page.

Good luck on your launch! I hope you have some killer copy planned out for your landing page. :) It's very important that not only all the bells and whistles work for your actual launch, but that you have a good sales pitch that'll make people want to buy your product.

Google Sites is a worthy resource but if you are looking for its perfect alternative then consider http://unbounce.com/. They are specialized in creating landing pages; have plenty of professional templates to choose from, and supports plenty of widgets + lead capture forms as well.

Have you checked out Hubspot yet? Despite their ill planned joke yesterday, they are actually a great company that can help you build landing pages (or contact forms) http://www.hubspot.com/products/landing-pages/

Keep in mind too that you need to measure the performance of your landing page to constantly optimize!

Google sites is a good way to start building landing pages. You can also build forms using google solution that will save information in google spreadsheets. Alternatively, you can try appsoncloud.com. Not trying to sell this - but we do have similar feature where you can capture leads and it goes to the CRM system where you can then follow up with the lead. The product is still in beta and we are looking for beta users. We'll reward you with free subscription - just for participating and giving us feedback.

<p><a href="http://unbounce.com/" rel="nofollow">Unbounce</a>.  I use the free service to host a 'coming soon' page for my startup.  They have a nice looking template specifically made for this purpose, and it collects email addresses for me.  It only took me 20 minutes to get started and I've been using the A/B testing functionality to try out different marketing messages to see what resonates with potential customers.</p>
