I've picked a domain name for my start-up.  lets say the domain name is http://www.friend.me
(not the actual domain name).

Somebody owns the Trademark "FriendMe" - I've searched for it via the patent office.  So basically that means I can't use "FriendMe" as the name of my site on the title/header etc.

Can I legally use friend.me on my site content (the header etc) - how significant is the dot in differentiating between different trademarks?

NB My company name is something completely different to the web site name.
