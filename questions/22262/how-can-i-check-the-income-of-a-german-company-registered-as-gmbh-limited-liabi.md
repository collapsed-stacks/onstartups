In many countries, the income of companies is public and accessible. My question is whether this is correct also for Germany, and where I could look up such information?

<p>This is also true for Germany. There's an official service by the <em>Bundesministeriums der Justiz</em> to search for all important information required to be published about companies:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.unternehmensregister.de/" rel="nofollow">www.unternehmensregister.de</a> (<a href="https://www.unternehmensregister.de/ureg/?submitaction=language&amp;language=en" rel="nofollow">English</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Documents are mostly not free of charge but from what I discovered much cheaper than "2nd-hand unofficial websites" that offering this service as well. With a credit card you can directly download the requested documents on their page as PDFs without even registering.</p>

you can use sites as http://handelsregister-online.net/ (a report costs usually arround 15 EUR) but most reports are up to 2 years old.
