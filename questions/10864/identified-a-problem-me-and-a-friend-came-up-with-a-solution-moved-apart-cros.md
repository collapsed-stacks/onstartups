I moved abroad for 6 months and one day me and my roommate identified a problem and came up with an idea for the solution. I thought it was brilliant and immediately started brainstorming, we checked into the feasibility at the time but we did not have the required capital.

We both move back home (opposite ends of the country) and I started working on the idea again. I bought a domain name, enrolled in an entrepreneurship class and another related business class, wrote a business plan, created financial statements, researched and put so much thought into the idea I was able to convince my family to lend me $5,000 to launch, contracted some developing work to be done, volunteered in the industry, met with all kinds of people to better understand the solution (technical people) and on friday I am going to go to a startup conference and pitch the idea to other engineers and entrepreneurs.

I believe there is a good chance at launching the site, but I havent told my friend I've been doing all this work.

My friend is unreasonable and will most likely demand equity or some compensation. How do I save the friendship without budging? I also never mentioned to my friend over the last 10 months that I was still working on the project.

If he wants to be involved, I will ask him to lend me money (without an exchange of equity) or to be on my street team in exchange for perks/free stuff I receive.

So, I guess my question is, do I tell him before or after the startup weekend, and how do I explain I didnt steal the idea, and the idea is worth little without implementing it right. He doesn't have a business bone in his body and even if he did make the effort I did, I feel like if we compared notes now, they would look nothing alike and my version would be light years ahead.

Were you trying to hide it from him?

I doubt you have a legal issue - but in my opinion your ethics and sense of fair play are highly suspect.  I think he'd be wise to steer clear of you and your business.  He certainly has every right to go off on his own and do the same thing.

I know that I wouldn't agree to work for "free stuff" for someone who was supposedly a friend and refused to share equity or even real payment.  It seems to me like you have an unreasonable view of just how valuable your company is right now.

You state that you want to "save the friendship" but in 10 months you never told him you were working on something you both had a hand in and you accuse him of being unreasonable, demanding and lacking business sense.  It hardly sounds like a friendship you want to save. (nor him for that matter)

Why did you even post this question?

It's clear from your initial description and follow-up comments that you had/have no intention of involving your friend, except as an unpaid tester.

You self-justify your reasons and are not prepared to budge on them.  Just mark this as the first in a likely long line of sacrifices you'll be making on your road to success.

If your friend had one good idea, he may have more. I wouldn't underestimate that. 

For him GIVING you the idea, which sounds an awful lot like what "he absolutely had nothing to add beyond 'it would be cool if so and so existed'" means, I would approach him with an initial gift of non voting founder's stock as a sign of gratitude. 

Then if he gets upset about you not having told him before, explain that it took you a year of research and work to figure out how to turn the idea into a business worth running with.

If he makes a good case for being part of the endeavor, why not let him work for increasing equity, based on performance, over the next two years? If it works out, you've saved the friendship and gained a useful biz partner. 

If he doesn't take to that, explain that currently, the company isn't worth much more than the effort you've put into it. By working for equity, you're both acknowledging the value of the effort he'll be adding, and the effort you've already put in. 

At that point, you've got some ethical ground to stand on, because if it works out, then you both deserve some ownership, and if he "doesn't have a business bone in his body" like you say, you at least gave him his chance and never put your control of the company in jeopardy.

If he wants more, explain that ideas are free, and he's welcome to develop it on his own and compete with you, which is true. I would also recommend explaining at this point that the gift of stock you offered is conditioned on him not doing that. If your assessment of your friend is accurate, you have nothing to worry about. If it isn't, you deserve what you get. 

All your commendable hard work aside, this is a situation you created by not being up front, and represents a lack of "soft skills" which I believe are essential for a successful CEO. IMHO, when you make a mistake, you should pay for it, and that's why I think starting with a stock offering is the right thing to do. 

Some tough love to reflect on. I hope it's useful for you.

Your dilemma is referred to as the "Forgotten Founders Syndrome." It's a real challenge to deal with because most people think that ideas are worth something. Actually, ideas are worthless unless acted upon, which is what it sounds like you did.

There are two ways you can handle this. The first is to ignore it. The downside to that is backlash from your friend and some potential legal issues if you make it big.

The 2nd way is to give him some founders stock in exchange for his "IP" rights. This is the most common way for founders to receive stock for their efforts. The agreement usually takes the form of a transfer all claims to the developed IP in exchange for founders stock. The amount of stock can be based on several things including effort and contributed capital.

If you choose the 2nd way, then the best approach is to list what you did and what he did and then make a policy on how that is rewarded. This also assumes that you will be a C-corp since that is the only way to really give out founders shares. If you choose an LLC, then it's a percent ownership and not stock.

It is perfectly acceptable for your friend to want some equity if he truly helped with the idea. In IP parlance, if he materially contributed to the IP, then he should be listed as an inventor.

Was there a reason you didn't ask your friend to be involved once you picked up the project again?

If you felt that he hadn't contributed much and you decicided to go it alone, then you might go for Jaries first option.

Whatever happens, be prepared to lose a friend. He may not be bothered, but I suspect he will view what is fair and what isn't fair differently to you.

At the end of the day, it is you who has put in all the effort, but he is likely to be a bit disgruntled why you never offered him the chance to come on board.

Good luck!
