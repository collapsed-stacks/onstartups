Can I apply for a DARPA grant, being a foreign citizen who has founded a company in the US? 

The company would be located in the US and there would be other founders with US citizenship.

From what I gather you are concerned about [FOCI](http://www.dss.mil/isp/foci/foci_info.html) requirements for [DSS](http://www.dss.mil).

The issue with FOCI might be on sensitive projects.  But there is nothing that I could see that you can't apply for the grant and be awarded it if you are a foreign citizen or a company.

P.S.  Of course I don't know if you are in one of the no-trade countries in which case ...

<p>Virtually every public company in the US has foreign investors. That by itself does not preclude a company from getting a DARPA grant. </p>

<p>An example of a DARPA grant given to a company with foreign investors is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37" rel="nofollow">Boeing X-37</a> project.</p>

<p>Boeing is a publicly traded company with foreign investors.</p>
