I hope this is not the wrong forum for this question, but I can't find one in the Stack Exchange "family" that would be more appropriate.

I have ideas for two web sites which I think will be quite popular (they are totally unrelated to each other). I am a programmer, and a "creative" (photographer, author, musician). So I have the "vision" as well as the technical know-how to bring these websites into being. My "problem" is that I'm champing at the bit to complete them, and don't have much time to work on them (being employed fulltime, etc.) If I continue to work on them in my so-called spare time, it will probably be a year or more before they are both done. If I was in a position to work on them fulltime (IOW, if I had a "silent partner" willing to invest enough money that I could quit my job), I could have them complete in about three months. I would be willing to partner with somebody or some group who would back me financially in this way. My vision/work combined with their monetary investment could bring about "great things" or at least moderately great things.

I know you can "crowd fund" startups and so on, but for that you need to expose your idea. My ideas are not something I would want to make public, as somebody might "steal" them. I'm willing to discuss them with serious individual potential investors, though (provided they were willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement). Does anybody have any recommendation on how I might find a suitable partner[s] for this/these ventures?

<p>Ideas are a dime a dozen.  It's all the hard work that goes into implementing the idea <em>completely</em> that makes the difference.</p>

<p>Call your project a hobby and work on it for a year or three.  When it's complete, you'll fully own the product, have a ton of experience, and you'll still have a day job to fall back on if necessary.</p>

<p>Larry Kersten said it well </p>

<p>What would you do if you obtain 3 months funding, quit your day job, then discover your project is actually going to take 9 months?  Can you afford it?</p>

<p>btw, there's a special term for people who would blindly give you money without knowing what you'd do with it.</p>
