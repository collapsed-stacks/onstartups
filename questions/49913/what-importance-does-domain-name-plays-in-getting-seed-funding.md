I want to start another dot-com company. So, can you tell me what importance domain name plays to get Seed funding?


The startup will be primarily based on web and company name might not be same as domain name.

You can change the domain name at any time.

It has zero importance when it comes to getting seed funding. 

No one will refuse to fund you because they don't like the domain name. Worst case scenario: they'll ask you to change it.

The era of thinking about companies as "dot-coms" is past. You are now mobility-enabled or a mobile app, an ecommerce company, a cloud-based service etc. Focus on identifying the technology niche of your company and its delivery model. Having a cool name will definitely help but whether you are a .com or .net matters less in my opinion. When in doubt, go with a .com address.
