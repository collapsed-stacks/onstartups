Even though the Lean Startup Machine events are focused on startup teams rapidly engaging markets to produce measurable results, comparing the results between the teams seems like it might be hard to do. How are winners selected?

Winners are selected by a panel of judges, which may include investors, LSM Mentors, and LSM Alumni. We give the judges specific criteria to evaluate each team based on, and we have a blind voting system. It is not evaluated like a VC pitch, we focus the judges around the execution depth of learning a team has done.

Usually the team that wins has collected a large amount of currency from customers, ie. $$, or has validated a concierge product.
