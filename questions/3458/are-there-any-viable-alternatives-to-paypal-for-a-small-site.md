I don't want to have the hassle of dealing with credit card or direct payments directly on my website, the volume and amount of transactions don't justify the effort.

I've set up Paypal on the site to allow for payments, but I'm not entirely happy with the experience.

Are there any viable alternatives to Paypal for the small website that will allow me to conduct business without having to handle customer details directly?

I'm using Paypal to allow people to donate or sponsor my site to contribute towards the running costs. Sponsors can advertise on the site, so I suppose it counts as sales. 

The problem came when my first sponsor tried to send a payment, Paypal wouldn't let them use their credit card "for security" and they had to use their bank account. My account has been authenticated and is tied to my bank account, so as far as I can see this only benefits Paypal as the customer no longer has CC protection or the ability to argue any unreasonable charges.

I'm looking for a solution that would allow people to contribute small amounts of money easily, and would allow people who want to sponsor the site to provide additional details so I can add their advert (email, url, comments etc).

<p>There's lots of places that run credit cards (and even take PayPal as an option).</p>

<p><strong>You could try Bitcoin</strong></p>

<p>Although <a href="http://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a> seems to suffer from a bad press, it has been operating consistently for 3 years now. Among it's advantages, it offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>no transaction fees to receive, very low to send (e.g. &lt; 0.01 USD for a 100 USD transaction)</li>
<li>near-instant transaction times</li>
<li>no chargebacks</li>
<li>wide range of economically viable transactions (e.g. sending 0.1 USD to Africa is feasible, as is sending 100,000 USD for about the same transaction fee)</li>
<li>no central issuing authority</li>
<li>completely global reach - no restrictions to destination or origin</li>
<li>resilient distributed architecture</li>
<li>high security for transactions</li>
<li>excellent support network and forums (see <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com">bitcoin.stackexchange.com</a> for example)</li>
<li>easy "cash out" options via exchanges to local currency to avoid volatility risk (each bitcoin you receive you can immediately sell on an exchange for your local currency)</li>
<li>free and open source implementation under MIT license</li>
</ul>

<p>For an example of <a href="http://gary-rowe.com/agilestack/2012/01/09/how-to-accept-bitcoins-on-your-blog-with-no-code/">how to use it in a blogging context</a> take a look at an article I recently posted that describes how to set it up. Not plugging, honestly, just sharing useful information. </p>

[Amazon Payments](https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/business?sn=cba/o&apaysccid=SESTCBAGOOBrand13784447) (or checkout, or flexpay) is fairly easy to setup, and offers many advance features if needed (3rd party transactions, micropayments, etc).

All parties do need an Amazon account (while with paypay that's optional for the buyer), and the UI is co-branded. However, depending on your market buyers may actually feel more comfortable using a process they're fa miler with (if they've bought from amazon in the past). 

Of course as already mentioned, knowing what you disliked about the paypal setup would help.

Unless you're looking to setup a merchant account (expensive)

Paypal,
Google Checkout,
and Amazon Payments are pretty much your options.

I've been bitten by PayPal's policies that left me burned a couple times in payment disputes. My biggest gripe is that they have made themselves the Judge and Jury. There is no appeal and no laws to back you up if you dispute their 'ruling' on a transaction dispute.

That being said, I continue to use them along with Google checkout and a merchant account simply because my clients have a (in my opinion) false sense of security in using it. I may very well at some point phase out PayPal if I find the cost of dealing with them is higher than the value I get from using them.

<p>Surprised no one has mentioned <a href="https://stripe.com/" rel="nofollow">Stripe</a> yet. I personally have not integrated their service (yet) but my business partner has successfully done so and found it to be very easy to set up. Like PayPal and Google it does not require any separate merchant account BS and their fees are quite reasonable.</p>

Don't be afraid of PayPal. They have become one of the most trusted payment provider on the web. And they do offer an inexpensive but secure acceptance of credit cards (for those who don't have PayPal) at very reasonable rates.

I'd bet if you did testing of a PayPal page versus any other provider, that the PayPal page would give the best results.
