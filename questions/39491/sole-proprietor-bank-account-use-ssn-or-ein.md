I am just starting a small business, and I need to open a business bank account. I went into the bank today, and they asked me if I wanted to use my SSN or the EIN for the business. What's the difference? I'm assuming the EIN, but I want to know why. Anyone want to explain in simple terms? 

Thanks!

No difference whatsoever. As a sole proprietor, you'll need the EIN for either of these two things:

1. Paying employees (here you don't have a choice).
2. Sending out tax forms (1099), and you don't want to send out your SSN everywhere (here its optional, you can use SSN).

For any other purpose SSN is more than enough.

A thing to keep in mind: you can only have **one** EIN per entity. So if you have an EIN for a different business that you're running as a sole proprietor, you'll have to continue using it for **all** your sole proprietorships.
