Are there any suggestions on a survey application I can use to pop up when someone is exiting my site? I am trying to get all the information I can to learn how to improve my web application. I just saw one that knew my first visit and came up with the survey but upon returning it must've known I already was there and said I didn't want to do the survey, so it didn't ask again. Perfect. Of course except now I can't see what tool they were using.

Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Clear your cookies in your browser and visit the site again. You may see the survey again.

Try using a different web browser. Maybe the survey will pop up then. If it doesn't, they might be using your IP address, so you could try a work computer. Or it could just be that the survey comes up randomly or only after you do something on the site that triggers it.

Although, I agree with Tim. I absolutely hate getting a popup when I'm trying to leave a site. I doubt many people actually take the time to fill them out, I know I don't. Sorry, probably not the answer you were looking for :-(

If somebody is leaving your site, chances are that they won't take the time to fill out a survey.  I know I would just ignore them.  A better way would be to use some web analytics and find out the part of your site where most people leave.  This may require some site re-design to get good data, but it will be worth it.
