## Who should process payments?

Suppose:

* Company A owns product P
* P is managed by company B
* The sales contract is between A and customers
* A has a contract with B such that B receives all income generated by P

Could B directly take payments from customers on behalf of A such that the sales contract is still with A? Or does A have to receive sales payments then pay it all to B?

It might be a bit convoluted, so thanks for your patience in advance.

Thanks

Anything is possible if all parties agree.

However, if I understand correctly, A has a vested interest in handling payments.  The contract between A and B obligates A to provide B with all income (revenue less expenses).  Providing B all revenue is a greater obligation and deprives A of direct access to funds to pay for expenses.

An additional consideration is that B would gain direct access to the customers and B would have increased ability to cut A out of the business.

<p>I agree with Yorick. Might as well ask for a professional advice from a corporate lawyer to settle things. Since B is the one managing the product P, B should be the one interacting with the consumers to avoid confusion.</p>
