UKRAINE! - Our MVP developer is a resident of the Ukraine.  We actually found him originally from a small project we posted on Odesk.  He was an associate of the developer we had hired.  We have had great luck with developers from Ukraine and Belarus. 

A great way to find developers is to lookup companies you admire on LinkedIN, and reach out to their people directly.

I used Craigslist.  He has his own software development company (apparently his own shop, and he works from home).  I was looking for someone local, and it was almost impossible to find someone- almost everyone was offshore.  Maybe that's a Craigslist thing, but it was a difficult search.

<p>Ironically, I interviewed someone for the developer position.  I asked him to do the famous <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html" rel="nofollow">FizzBuzz</a> test and asked several difficult programming related questions.  He became very frustrated and agitated that he was unable to do the FizzBuzz test that he basically just got up and left.</p>

<p>Later this same person, said he had a friend who was a really good programmer that I had to interview.  Luckily I took his advice and interviewed him with some questions and a different type test.  He passed with flying colours, and is my all star developer.  It's really ironic how it all played out but I am really happy with the outcome. </p>
