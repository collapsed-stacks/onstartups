I wonder how companies like Y Combinator are structured. Y Combinator is a [seed accelerator][3], investing in and consulting businesses. On Y Combinator's web site, there is a [list of partners][1]. Y Combinator is registered as an [LLC][2].

In particular I wonder:

  * Does partner mean that the person has a share in the company? An equal share?

  * Is it possible that partners are guaranteed a share in the businesses that they consult?

  * Who owns the fund which is the source for investments?

I don't know about Y-Combinator in particular but most investing funds are organized the same way.

Usually, there is a *management company* which manages a fund of money on behalf of *limited partners* who put in the money. The management company partners are called *general partners*.

* Partners have shares in the management company, yes. They do not have to be equal shares
* General Partners are not necessarily granted shares in the portfolio companies themselves, but the Limited Partners are.
* The fund is owned by the Limited Partners in proportion to the amount of money they each invest.
