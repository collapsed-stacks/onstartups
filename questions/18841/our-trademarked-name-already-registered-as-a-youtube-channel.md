The channel is unused, last activity over a year ago. Its empty, no videos uploaded, etc.

Does it make sense for us to contact YouTube and petition them to turn the account over to us?

Its an odd question, so thanks in advance for your opinions. 

Not sure the best idea is emailing the account owner and negotiating with them.

if you've already trademarked your name, no reason not to contact Youtube.  Why not offer to let them shut down the channel or re-name it instead?

I think you are safe. But like any advices here, I recommend you to ask to a specialized lawyer.

It's lot more difficult to register a mark that was used in commercial context by someone else.

For example if **Acme Corp.** sold a product named **Brand123** for years, it's almost impossible to register it.

Sometimes you can, and in that case, you will be able to use your trademark exclusively, except that Acme Corp. will be able to continue to use it also.

In your case (no commercial product or company) and if it's not a common word, you won't get any issue.
