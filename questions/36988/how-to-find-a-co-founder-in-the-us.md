I am willing to move from france to the US but it seems hard without a co-founder to incorporate a web company. I wonder if  there is a "way" to find one. I know that's a little difficult and random to find one and I seek my way for the moment alone. I know also that depends a lot from a lot of factors, but everybody seems to start with co-founder and it seems the right and most successful way to do a web business.

What's the best way to find a co-founder when you are outside the US? Does it worth it?
