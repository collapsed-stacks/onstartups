I've recently discovered a patent for a product that's in the field of the product I'm working on. The patent itself has zero direct resemblance to the product I'm working on, but there are "early warning signs" that the patent holder might be a troll.

For example, a couple of other (very prominent) sites in the same problem domain have notices on their sites that some tools on the sites are covered by the patent holder's patents. (Note, though, that these sites are much more similar to the patent than mine is)  
The patent holder isn't a complete troll, because they do sell a product described by their patent. It doesn't seem to be in active development, though (relative to the thoroughness of the legal notices).

This raises a couple questions:  
 - Is the notice that tools are covered by patent likely a result of a (paid) settlement with a troll? Or is it somehow a way of avoiding lawsuits?  
 - Could my dissimilar site be threatened in a similar way?  
 - Are there good methods of getting other data points about the troll-ishness of the patent holder?

For research on the "troll-ishness" you should be able to combine the company's name along with terms like: infringement, settlement, "filed suit" and similar terms that relate to lawyers fighting. It's not perfect but should be a good starting point.
