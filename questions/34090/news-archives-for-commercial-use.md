I am looking to mine the data from older news articles for my startup.
One way i can think of is to crawl financial websites and extract the information i need.
It can be a hard and also not without its pitfalls.

Is there an alternate way, i could licence the news archives in an affordable way.
The articles will not be published as it is on my site. I will link to the original article with a blurb like google news.

Thanks
Shyam

<p>There are firms like <a href="http://boardreader.com/info/about.htm" rel="nofollow">BoardReader</a> and <a href="http://www.moreover.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">Moreover</a> that will sell you the data and offer API level access, but they are not particularly cheap.</p>

<p>I, too, will be quite interested to see what is available in machine readable form at low or no cost.</p>
