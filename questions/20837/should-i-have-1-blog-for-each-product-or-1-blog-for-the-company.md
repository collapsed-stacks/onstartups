We have several products in several different areas (some are in the same areas). Should we start a blog for each product or should we write in our company blog everything?

What's the best strategy for someone who makes different apps? 

I know 37signals write everything in their main website, but is that a good strategy for a new startup?

Thanks

Try to decide on the basis of the following:

 - do you have enough content to have seperate blogs for each product?
 - do you want to increase brand or product awareness?
 - can you group your products to categories? - this way you could reduce the number of blogs

If you point out what is your primary goal with blogging, it is easier to give an answer.

Generally I wouldn't advise for a startup to have separate blogs for each product. Because it's a bunch of work!!! And I suppose you do not have enough content in the beggining... maybe later you can have seperate blogs on the basis of visitor activity!

On the other hand if you want to have seperate sites because of SEO, than it's a totally different case!

I'm guessing that the goal you are trying to achieve with your Blogs is to drive your SEO ranking up. If that is the case, I will backup Rolan on the fact that you would need a lot of content for each product to actually make it meaningful. I'm also guessing that if you are a startup, your product have to be in the same category or type of service. If they are not, you might want to consider rethinking your strategy to be more focus. It is important to be laser focus when you start a business.

My take on your question is: Have only one Blog, categorize properly and Tag properly to help Search Engine find their way in your blog and its content. Having one blog will increase the overarching SEO weight of you site and will benefit all your content.

If you really have very different product on very different subjects, then having different blgos can make sense. 

hope this helps

Think about your audience, and craft which blogs you want around that. I think you're going to want one main blog though to minimize your workload.

- If all your products are intertwined and mostly related - Then you could create one product blog with categories for each product, and let users subscribe to specific categories (sort of like 37Signals Product Blog)

- If users would never care about your other products and only about the one they bought - Then make a separate blog. This would be harder for you to manage and market though
