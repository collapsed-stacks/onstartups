a) Smart companies have a vesting schedule for founder's stock. Many companies are not smart, and issue founder's stock with no vesting. Having no vesting (immediately vested) is a recipe for future disaster, and it is still the norm.

b) If you are being issued with stock there is no such thing as a 'strike price'. Instead there will be a 'purchase price'. You will pay the company in cash - normally fractions of a cent per share if you are a founder, so it will be hundreds to low thousands of dollars - and in return will receive shares. You own them today. (Your vesting should take the form of a share buyback, where the company can buy back the unvested shares for the price you paid.)

A 'strike price' is a term used for options. Options are not stock: they are a contract that gives you to right to buy stock in the future. They are supposed to give (most of) the potential upside of stock, (mostly) without the rights that stock owners have.
