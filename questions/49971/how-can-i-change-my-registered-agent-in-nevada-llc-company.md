I started an LLC in Nevada with one RA, but am being charged a high price. Can I change the RA without endangering the LLC? And How to do it?

<p>Yes you can. The state of Nevada charges a $60 filing fee for the update but you can change your registered agent anytime you want without affecting your company's status. The form you must file with the state is found here: <a href="http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=1015" rel="nofollow">http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=1015</a></p>
