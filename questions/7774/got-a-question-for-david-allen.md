We're set to interview David Allen (GTD**) Wednesday. 

If you use the Getting Things Done approach, what question would you like me to ask David for you, re being most productive when founding a startup?

Big fan of GTD, great get.

There are lots of tools to manage your basic actions / next-actions; I've used several and many are good.

What I don't see are good tools to manage projects, as opposed to next-actions.  To manage the artifacts, schedules, people, etc..

What tools does David recommend for that side of organization?

Can David recommend tactics for to get better at weekly reviews (both personal and business)? I personally would like to discover profound answers during my weekly reviews but often arrive at a blank thought.

Huge fan of GTD.  Looking forward to the podcast!

I'd love to hear more on how different members of a team can make use of GTD.  I'm using GTD already, how best to get my co-founders to also use it, and together get more done.    Love ot hear examples/tools.

I am new to GTD using it just over a month.  Any advice on how to better incorporate unknown factors and unexpected/unplanned events that are very much part of  start ups into a GTD system would be appreciated.
