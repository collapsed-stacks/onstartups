My co-founder wants to suspend our company instead of terminating it. Is there such a thing as a Founder's Suspension Agreement? If not, is there a guide on how to write a Founder's Termination Agreement?

<p>No, you can't temporarily terminate your business. However, you can always just suspend everyday business operations without legally terminating.</p>

<p>If that's not an option, it sounds like the topic you want research is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation" rel="nofollow">liquidation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_%28law%29" rel="nofollow">dissolution</a>. To dissolve your company, you need to file the relevant paperwork with the secretary of state or the corporations division in your state.</p>
