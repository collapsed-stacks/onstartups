I'm a developer, who has been working solo on a startup for close to 12 months.

The tech side is coming along well, but I'm acutely lacking in my business accumen, and sales skills.

Here's some key points on where I'm at:

 - I've performed market validation with customers
 - The product is developed to an MVP point, possibly well beyond
 - I don't yet have any customers - largely due to my fear of sales.  The product is at a point where it *needs* customers.
 - I've developed a business plan, (including initial pricing) and validated this with key people across the market.  However, as I don't yet have customers, it's arguably unproven.
 - I'm currently working 2-3 days / week on this startup, and consulting to keep the lights on.

I have a few potential avenues to persue here:

 * Bring in a CEO / COO, on a mixture of salary & equity.  I don't have much money at the moment.
 * Bring in a 'co-founder', for higher equity, and no money.
 * Tough it out, get customers leading to revenue, then hire.

Are there other avenues I should be considering?

Which path makes the most sense at my current juncture?

Also, if I bring in a co-founder, should I expect them to buy into the business, given it's current state?  Likewise, what % of equity should I reasonably put on the table?
