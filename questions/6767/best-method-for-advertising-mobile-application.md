Difficult to tell w/o knowing more.

 1. what platform - iphone, android, winmo ?
 2. what target - consumer,
    business  
 3. what type - game,
    ecommerce, utility

Find a direct competitor and deep search where they are - and then target the same media outlets.

Or - if you have $$$ go to an agency and have them do the above.  If your product warrants it, gorilla marketing companies can offer non traditional media placement.
