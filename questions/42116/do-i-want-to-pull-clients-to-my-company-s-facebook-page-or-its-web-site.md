I am writing an iOS app which I hope to publish in the next month or so. In parallel, I will set up a web site and a Facebook page for my company. The purpose of these sites is to show other apps I've developed, show screen-shots the apps and provide a forum where people can contact me. I will have the option of displaying one of these site from my app.

So the question is: Should I be using the facebook page to drive people to my web site or the other way around?

I'd say the website since you have more fine-grained control over it. Also it looks more professional than directing people to the Facebook profile from the app page. I understand you have both, but the first impression might be that you only have the Facebook page.

Both are important and have different purposes, but when you say "pull clients to", it makes me think the answer is your website.

A website can be great, you have complete control, but people have to come to you.   That's the challenge and why facebook is so powerful.  If you have a way of "pulling them" to you, then  I would certainly bring them to the website.

The great thing about facebook is that you are going to where they already are, that's its advantage.  So don't pull them there, you are just there to reach the people that already are.

So I guess... use both, each are different.  But when it comes time to send them somewhere, send to your website.

Unlike all other answers, I would say, drive them to your facebook page, create a like gate for your facebook page and redirect users to that like gate and gather likes on your facebook page, when they like your page, redirect them to your facebook page. 

Why? Because once you let people like your page, they are connected to your brand and you will gat many more chances to approach them to visit your website or introduce them to your offerings. A whole lot of marketing will be done this way, another benefit of getting users on your facebook page is that this way you can build credibility of your brand. When user see a page with thousand of likes on it, they will think its a credible brand. 

And now come to SEO point, driving traffic to your website is important, but repeated visitors on your website benefit your website more then getting new visitors everytime, this way, search engines like google consider your website more credible as the people who have visited your website once are visiting again. 

So I would suggest, drive them to a like gate of facebook page, and then get them to your facebook page.

Your own website would be better than a Facebook Page. Being frank, exposing/showcasing your service & contact places using Facebook Page will lack the professional outlook. Plus, having a website gets you the benefits of full control.

On the other hand, if you just want a volume of people to check out your app you can employ a Facebook Page straight away.

Own website vs Facebook page is just like Quality vs. Quantity.
I suggest to go with quality in the first place. It would automatically add the quantity.
