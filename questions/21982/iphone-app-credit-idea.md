I am looking to develop a mobile application that allows users to sell and purchase a digital asset using a micropayment credit system. We also may require using internal functionality of the mobile device such as photo library. After reading it looks like we have to create a native application for iOS because of the functionality requirements. 

The questiona are: 

 1. Is this something that would be difficult to get approval in the apple app store? 
 2. Does it make sense to just target android? 
 3. Is there any way to circumvent the issue of internal functionality like photo library in an html5 safari application, or would you rethink the application functionality? 
 4. What would be the logistics of having apple take such a large chunk of revenue for users when its less on android or the web based application version?

## 2. It may make sense: ##
The market is big but the heat is in the App Store.

## 3. Sure: ##
For example just make the users send the photos from an email.
Or make an app to just upload and view pictures in your market. Rights then could be bought there.
