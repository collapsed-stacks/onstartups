I'm in the process of importing some oem-designed electronic for my brand. Where should I look for certification rules in United States and Canada?

Does my product need to be certified to be sold in USA if I don't have a U.S. presence?

> Does my product need to be certified to be sold in USA

Many, but not all, products do. Examples of products that require certification include such things as drugs, some foods, medical devices and radio transmitters. Many electronic devices that emit incidental radiation need to be certified under Part 15 of the FCC rules. Take a look at your computer, monitor or laptop and you may very well find a statement to that effect.

Other simple products like a hammer or a screwdriver probably do not need any sort of certification. 

Since you state your product is electronic, the question is does it radiate any RF energy? If so, then you should carefully comply with the rules of the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). Examples of such products include radios, TVs, cordless mice, wireless routers, microwave ovens etc. The list is long and if in doubt you should check to see if devices similar to yours being sold in the USA have a statement of compliance with FCC rules on them. If so, that is a good indication that your device would be covered by the same rules as well.
