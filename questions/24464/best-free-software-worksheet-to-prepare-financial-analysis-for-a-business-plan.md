I'm writing down a business plan and I'm looking for a FREE software or worksheet which helps and guides you in preparing the financial documents for the first, say, 5 years of operations (income statement, cash flow statement, balance sheet).
Did you have any good experience in a similar situation? If so, please share!
Thank you very much for any kind of help

Check government and other web sites that are dedicated to helping business kick-off and innovation.
In Portugal I've used one spreadsheet from IAPMEI (governmental organization for business innovation) that was very complete, full coverage up to 5 business years.

Check similar sources in your country. Since most probably there will be some particularities, such as taxes and laws, localized tools/spreadsheets may help on some details.
