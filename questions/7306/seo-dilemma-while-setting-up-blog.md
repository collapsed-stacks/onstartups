I have a website which is a web application. I am going to add a blog(wordpress installation). From SEO point of view is it better to have "http://blog.mysite.com" or
"http://www.mysite.com/blog" ?

I hate to point to another moz article, but this one is a bit more recent and talks about why subfolders are generally preferable to subdomains - http://www.seomoz.org/blog/understanding-root-domains-subdomains-vs-subfolders-microsites.

<p>The short answer is: depends, but with modern search engines, it probably doesn't make much difference.  <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/subdomains-or-subfolders-which-are-better-for-seo/6849/" rel="nofollow">Search Engine Journal</a> has a fairly good article on this topic.</p>

<p>I would argue that it should follow the convention of the rest of the site.  So, for instance, if your site has <a href="http://www.mysite.com/learn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysite.com/learn/</a>, <a href="http://www.mysite.com/explore/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysite.com/explore/</a> and <a href="http://www.mysite.com/meta" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysite.com/meta</a> as major portions, use <a href="http://www.mysite.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysite.com/blog/</a>.  If it has <a href="http://learn.mysite.com/" rel="nofollow">http://learn.mysite.com/</a> and so on, use <a href="http://blog.mysite.com/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.mysite.com/</a>.</p>

<p>I personally follow the one-subdomain-per-major-product-group philosophy, and the blog covers all product groups, so I give the blog its own subdomain.  YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).</p>

<p>dated - but another good article from <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/subdomains-subfolders-and-toplevel-domains" rel="nofollow">SEOMOZ</a></p>

<p>99% of the time a subfolder is the proper way to go.  If you are launching an entirely different product (maps.google.com, translate.google.com) then subdomains are the right way to go.</p>

<p>Matt Cutts from Google wrote a good article about this on <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/subdomains-and-subdirectories/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/subdomains-and-subdirectories/</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My personal preference on subdomains vs. subdirectories is that I usually prefer the convenience of subdirectories for most of my content. A subdomain can be useful to separate out content that is completely different. Google uses subdomains for distinct products such news.google.com or maps.google.com, for example. If you’re a newer webmaster or SEO, I’d recommend using subdirectories until you start to feel pretty confident with the architecture of your site.</p>
