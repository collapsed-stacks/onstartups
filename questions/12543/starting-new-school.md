I'm starting a new post-secondary school (college) that is project-based and the curriculum is student-centered and have definitely bit off a lot to chew. Funding and a partner would be nice. Question: Where do I find a person who fits both bills and may share my vision?

A couple of ideas:

 1. Start with your networks. Who do you know and who do they know? 

 2. Approach people in education that you really admire and share your vision with them. They may be able to help you or recommend someone. Be sure to find something you can do to help them.

Ryan,

Sounds an interesting project and I agree there is alot of potential in developping a student-centered model.  At Rusdens we are working on an online  peer-to-peer learning concept i.e. student learn through reviewing each other's work (see www.rusdens.com )   the key benefits of this approach of flexibility (relatively easy to introduce new modules) , scalabilty (growth isn't limited by finding teachers / premises) and minimal costs.  

Our aim is to have 4,000 annual enrollements @ ~$350 per course by 2012 this will be achieved by offering 8 main courses to SME's and individuals.  We are currently self funded and working on the project at night and weekends. 

I don't think I'm the right person to partner / fund your school but am happy to help with specific queries where I can, maybe through a weekly catch-up?

I look forward to hearing from you



Nigel

Something else Ryan, that I learnt from a friend of mine who is a really smart entrepreneur, is to recruit people with specific skills to do a specific role. In other words, when he partners with someone, he knows exactly what skills he needs them to bring to the business and what they will contribute and he writes this into the agreement.

He learnt this the hard way after making someone a director in the early days because they were enthusiastic and had contacts, but they didn't pull their weight and can't be relied upon to fulfill their commitments. Now they own a chunk of the business and don't do much.
