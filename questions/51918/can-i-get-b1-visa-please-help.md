<blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<p>You cannot work on B1 visa. It is used for <em>business</em> travel - i.e.: meetings, conferences, sales, occasional and limited field support.</p>

<p>If your CEO meant that he's going to bring you to the US office to <em>work</em> for any prolonged period of time - then he is either misinformed or is misinforming you. It is not allowed.</p>

<p>Is this for a temporary travel visa, as described here? <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1265.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1265.html</a></p>

<p>You will need to contact your local embassy. Here's the directory listings for India: <a href="http://www.usembassy.gov/sca.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usembassy.gov/sca.html</a></p>

<p>You cannot earn income through W2 or 1099 payrolls on a B1 visa.</p>

<p>Your CEO either doesn't know, or is intentionally bringing you in to work for free and might throw this "discovery of the law" after you arrive. Let me guess, its an Indian IT consulting firm.</p>

<p>B1/B2 visa is for temporary visit for the purpose of business/pleasure, or the combination of both.</p>

<p>What you need is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_visas#L-1_Intracompany_Transferee" rel="nofollow">L1 visa</a>. This way, you can live and work for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>Or alternately, you can get H1b visa. What I've heard is that L1 is easy obtain compared to H1b.</p>
