I registered an LLC in DE (a few days ago). The congratulatory package that I received from the online company registration website says that I might have to register as a "foreign LLC" in the state of California. Does this mean I have to pay California franchise tax as well? My intent is not to avoid paying CA income taxes, rather just to reduce the franchise taxes until there is "income" generated by my website.

Would you folks suggest that I terminate the Delaware LLC and register a new California LLC (before I start doing business transactions)? I have no employees (sole-proprietor).

Thanks.

If you are doing business in California you have to pay California minimum franchise tax no matter if you are a Delaware or CA entity.  However, you would avoid paying Delaware minimum taxes if you were CA only a CA entity.
