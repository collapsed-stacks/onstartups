I'm looking to approach some local companies that my startup has synergy with about making a strategic investment in my company?

Any ideas on how to approach these prospects? 


Thanks...:)

Some basics:

 1. if possible, make a personal connection with the owner, and don't pitch things right off the bat.
 2. Find out what their "pains" are. Find out what they're struggling with, and where you can *really* improve their situation.
 3. Approach the entire conversation with an eye for "what can we do for you." Maybe you don't even get anything out of it the first time. But establishing that relationship is gonna mean you're on their good side and can get what you're interested in eventually.

as a side note, I'll add one more:

 4 - Be an attractive woman, or send one to talk to them. It's sexist, but so horribly effective. The most personable men I know, who are phenomenal salesmen, still don't get the same access and treatment as my very attractive business partner.
