I'd like to make sure we have good practices in place for off site storage and back up for a start up on which I'm working. Currently, there are three of us and we each use different back up approaches for our PC's. I use Apple's Time Machine, one of my partners uses CD's, the other uses an extra hard drive and we e-mail key files to each other. This is OK but not sufficient as we move forward.

We're looking for a service which provides off site ("cloud") storage, provides software which automates the back up process, and can run in both Windows and Mac environments. We need approximately 300GB. 

Suggestions on specific services and comments on your experiences are welcome.

Thanks.

<p>I like to separate the "my laptop is dead, how do I get back up and running" type of backup from the "our business will suffer if we lose this information" type of backup.</p>

<p>For the first type, the most important question is how easy and reliable is it to get a new machine back running with your old programs and settings. I can't speak for Windows but Time Machine is terrific for this with Macs.</p>

<p>For the second type, a service to seriously look at is <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="nofollow">DropBox</a>. They give you a shared filesystem which is compatible with Mac and Windows and is really, really easy to use. They have a 100GB plan for $19.99 (and if that's not enough, you could have one account each).</p>

Dropbox, SugarSync, Syncplicity all do roughly the same things - keep files synced across multiple computers and backed up the cloud.  I like SugarSync because I can sync any folder on one computer with a folder in a different location on another one.

There are also more traditional backup solutions like  Mozy and Jungle Disc.

You could also use hosted Git (github.com) or Subversion for development artifacts.

DropBox are the current social media darling.  
My brief experience using the free trial was very good also.

Dropbox is a very good solution for Backing/Syncing of all Files, and is a Continuous Backup system.
