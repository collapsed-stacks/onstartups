How does a website like deviantART make money? They allow users to create free accounts and upload data for free. I heard some venture capitalists invest in such websites but how can one capitalize and convert popularity of a site to money? This is what I don't understand. 

Also, how do the creators of such websites make a profit and become so rich?

They achieve this by selling physical artwork for high prices.

If you go to the web site, look for the "Shop" menu item up the top. That's where they make some of their money.

In addition there is advertising on pages.
