This is my first question on "onStartups" so please be constructive if my question is not appropriate so I can get real help on this.

I really pushed hard and created something that is quite different for content management in that it uses a REST-style interface, HTML5 editing and then can be plugged in to any server-side website in 5 minutes. It runs off a CDN so it has extreme availability and is already on a scalable architecture. Its Content Management or a CMS as a Service and acts as a content delivery network for your images and movies etc.

It has a decent user base at least in terms of who's using it as its in use in high traffic ecommerce sites.

However,

I'm not a marketer. I'm a programmer. I don't know how to market very well. I feel rather stupid in this area.

Any suggestions?

I will gladly put on my marketer hat for this one (I do copy writing for ISVs.) This is a great question. 

As a host of several web sites I have wondered what "the cloud" could possibly do for me. The alternatives that are open to low end publishers in terms of CMS tend to be traditional "message board" type packages like Drupal, Wordpress, etc. The problem of delivering rich content has been on the shoulders of the publisher. The best solution I have been able to come up with myself is to host VPS space or a dedicated server. Both are a pain because you have to dedicate half of your work life to making certain that things are running smoothly. Load balancing and scalability for the small fry is simply not available.

So, let me ask you this:

Why did you write this product in the first place? What real life problem or shortcoming of existing solutions were you trying to solve? 

If my reflection above on the nature of selecting and using a CMS has any relationship to your reasoning, then just work outward from that point. Try to reason like a customer and challenge your statements like a customer would. Just as *you* want to save money or do things better before you spend on something, your customers will reason the same way. 

IE: ask these questions of yourself and formulate convincing trial answers:

Who do you help?

What technical problem do you solve?

(Big rhetorical question for hosting) How do you help your customers save money and/or deliver their content better?

So I don't have a discrete, single answer for you. I doubt anyone does. But I see promise.

Initially when I read "CMS" as a tag for someone's product I think "with everything out there that is free, that's a stupid thing to develop as a commercial product." 

BUT... you have a really interesting spin on the concept, by making content delivery networks accessible without coding (if I get your product's main idea.) If I were you I would leverage that fact ("milk" it) for all it's worth. 

I am open to a further dialog, either here or off line.
