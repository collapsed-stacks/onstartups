I have found a good keyword phrase to target, however, there is no global or local search for it. How do I make a user start typing my keyword phrase, which is almost at zero according to the Google keyword tool?

In other words, how do you make people start searching with your keyword phrase?

You can't. 

Google's keyword tools are there to help webmasters decide what keywords to target, not the other way around. You can't force people to all of a sudden start searching for a specific keyword. If people currently aren't searching for a keyword or phrase it could be for several reasons. One reason could be that it's something so innovative that it doesn't exist yet. Another reason could be that it's just not a natural way of phrasing something.

However, whatever the reason is for the lack of use of that keyword or phrase, the fact remains that people don't search for it. 

My advice is to forget about that phrase no matter how great you think it is, and come up with one that people actually do search for that has low to medium competition.

If you have found a key word or phrase that you **think** directly targets your market **and** Google indicates virtually no one is actually searching using that keyword or phrase, you have discovered one of two things:

 1. You are **incorrect** in thinking this is a good description of your product or service.
 2. You actually have a good keyword or phrase that virtually no one else in the world has thought of. The **only** way to get people to search using this term or phrase is to **advertise** it. You would have to inform the public that this is a good way to find X.

The problem with answer two, above, is three-fold. 

 1. The odds are that no one is using the keyword or phrase because it is **not** a good search term.
 2. Advertising a keyword or phrase, so people will use it to search for X, is almost always going to be less productive than directly advertising X! You are in effect, advertising an advertisement.
 3. Changing human behavior is **very** difficult.
