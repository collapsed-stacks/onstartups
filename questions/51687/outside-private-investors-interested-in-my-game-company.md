<p>These are new grounds for me so I have a lot of questions. I'll just touch on a few not to overwhelm!</p>

<p>I have a new game company and I have a couple interested investors who may invest some seed, working capital with a figure that probably won't be over 100k. My company is not 'off the ground' yet but I do have office space and a couple of employees lined up when I acquire some capital. Finally, we have a great game that is in production. </p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>
So what should they get for their investment? 
Do I give them a % of the company, if so, how much? 
Do they get net revenue from sales of my games? 
Do they get a seat on my board? 
Ownership of IP?
+ Anything else I missed? </p>

<p>Does it just come down to negotiations where every 'deal' is its own case - or is there a general formula I should follow in this situation. </p>

<p>Considering they will directly help us get off the ground, I'm definitely willing to honour them for their investment, I just don't know what that should be.</p>

<p>Appreciate the responses!</p>

<p>The terms are up to you and the investor. The investor is looking for a return on their money as quickly as possible, and a way to make a profit after that. </p>

<p>There are a lot of things to consider, such as do you want someone to just feed you money and you continue doing all the work? Are you looking for a strategic partner to help with the logistics/etc?</p>

<p>You also should know your market. How much revenue are your competitors making? Are they one-hit-wonders or do they continue on after their first hit?</p>

<p>Your goal is to retain as much worth of the business as you possibly can and the investor's goal is to obtain as much worth of the business as they possibly can. Whether that means equity to sell later on, skimming off the top of profits... it's the pros and cons that you have to weigh out and you have to figure out what will be best for your newborn business.</p>
