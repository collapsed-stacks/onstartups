<p>So I am planning entering a joint development agreement with a land owner in India. I will handle the construction costs and he will provide the land. So I figured the share division will be evaluated based on construction cost and land value. But when I was looking for similar deals I found many people offering their property(land) for Joint Development and pushing for a 60-40 share(not sure who owns 60%). So I was wondering if there is a market standard for such kind of deal  Where immaterial of construction cost the share is divided on a 6:4(60%-40%) ratio? If not how is the deal evaluated? Since my investment is a liquid asset does it have better value?</p>
