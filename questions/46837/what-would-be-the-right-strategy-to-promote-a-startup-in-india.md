We have a rating based social blogging platform. The webiste got launched about a month ago and is in its beta stage now. Being established in India, where the domain of users of the site, the readers and the writers, is constricted and had it been launched in the US, it would have got better reception than what it is getting now. How should we pitch the global audience to get them to know about our website?

You mean other than blogging, and tweeting about it, promoting it on social media, and online advertising? And using sites like Reddit, Hacker News?

i do not have professional experience but my idea is ....
1. I think creating a page in Facebook would be worth as your friends can help you promote.
2. consider promotional offers.

You could encourage your local users to recommend the site to their overseas contacts (relatives, friends, etc). Maybe some inducement for recommending people, even just "points" or "badges", like this site.
