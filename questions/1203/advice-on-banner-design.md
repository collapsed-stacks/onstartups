What do you do when you need a banner to advertise your product?  
Design it yourself, hire a local designer or use some design services on the web?  
What do you recommend for a small company with a tight budget?

<p>Unless you have graphic design and advertising creative experience, it'd be worthwhile having someone else do it. You can use a local company, but we've found a lot of success with 99designs: <a href="http://99designs.com/users/317302" rel="nofollow">http://99designs.com/users/317302</a>. Most of thoes banners ended up costing around $200, which is much less than a local designer.</p>

<p>Whatever route you go, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Almost all advertising is passively consumed; the only reason people pay attention is because the Most Prominent Thing catches their periphery and entices them to spend a second to glance over</li>
<li>People will visually follow the MPT to the second MPT, then to the third, etc; but, they won’t go to the Second or Third if they weren’t impressed by the first</li>
<li>If the First and Second MPT are not nearby, then confusion breaks out and some people will go the First and others to the Second</li>
<li>All of this occurs unconsciously within a fractions of a second</li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping these in mind, you can avoid a lot of mistakes such as having your company logo be big and prominent.</p>

Do not forget to plan the banner campaign with more than one graphical option. 

If you run the site where the banners will be shown, use A/B testing or just ask to the content site to provide you with as real time statistics as they can.

Good Luck!
