have lead lists gone the way of the dinosaur or are they still used today.

I am asking because I became the owner of a leads database and i wanted to try coding a website to make them available online. If its rare something like this would get used i will pay less attention while developing and testing out technology.

but if there is some need i would add some care to the design and such in order to make it presentable.

while at lunch i was challenged by a fellow techie about who the audience for this would be and i was not able to name one. 

I would be very interested to learn who uses and participates in leads lists today.

I think it depends on the leads type you have. D&B (www.dnb.com) is a billion dollar company selling very customized and targeted leads to companies. So I won't say leads are out dated, I think it depends on the product you are trying to sell. At nochallenge.net, we do often buy leads for targeted audience and often had success. Good luck.
