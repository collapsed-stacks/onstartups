I love the concept of www.performable.com however pricing is ridiculously expensive for a small-medium startups.


Is there any cheap alternative for Performable?

I'm actually interested in customer Customer Profiles feature where they cna track down a customer from interested to order process.

http://www.performable.com/site-analytics/


Or can we implement a similar feature by using Google Analytics in our website?

Performable has a great platform. With GA you wont be able to collect customer level specifics due to their privacy policy.  They still allow for funelling.  

As alternatives you can look at:

 - CrazyEgg.com - Expensive but neat heat maps of how your users interact
   with each page
 - woopra.com - realtime analytics, plus chat which is a nice feature 
 - GetClickly.com - My Personal Favorite  
 - HaveaMint.com
 - Piwik.org - Open Source self hosted



On our sites we run a combination of both GA and GetClicky.com
We also integrate our own custom server side code which uses cookies and a database to track specific actions by each of our visitors. 

You have to find a combination what works best for you, but having GA on your site never hurts.
