If an overseas business runs a Kickstarter campaign via a US or UK person's account, does anyone know what the tax implications would be for a US resident? Does anyone know what the tax implications would be for a UK resident?

Is it as simple as they did not earn the money because it was channelled through to the overseas business (in this case, an Australian business)?

(I ask because Kickstarter currently allows only US and UK Amazon Payments accounts.)

Thank you in advance for your response.  :)

Pretty simple. The US resident (account owner) will be liable for income taxes on the income raised.

Well, that's not what they said when they started the campaign, so no-one cares. The US resident **will** be liable for taxes.
