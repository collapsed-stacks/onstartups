In retrospect of this [question][1], I would like some **advice** on tech startups using a [coop][2] model (as a workers' coop). Advice on charter and finances mostly.

<p>Cooperative models are enjoying something of a surge in interest. Your starting point should probably be to study the "<a href="http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html" rel="nofollow">Statement on the Co-operative Identity</a>," and decide whether this fits what you are trying to achieve. </p>

<p>Then play devil's advocate, and ask the question, "am I really just describing a partnership?" -- which is less exciting and more straightforward. </p>

<p>(Looking at your linked question, I think that may be exactly what you're describing. For instance, if you're already thinking that a significant proportion of the team may not be eligible for a share on account of their role, that sounds like a partnership, not a coop, even a worker coop, to me.)</p>

<p>And if after all that you want to go ahead, I would make contact directly with either a national representative body (likely to be an ICA member) or a functioning Coop. You're likely to find all kinds of practical support, and access to appropriate model charters etc.</p>

<p>In the UK, <a href="http://www.co-operative.coop/enterprisehub/start-a-co-operative/" rel="nofollow">The Co-Operative</a> does an amazing job helping new Coops to get started, giving free advice and often helping access free expert consultancy.</p>
