I need to know if there are start-up conventions(just the same way there are car shows and that sort of thing) where one can attend or even possibly rent out a booth for the day to hand out flyers and promote your start-up. **Any ideas on websites?**

<p>I believe the two most popular are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/" rel="nofollow">TechCrunch Disrupt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://demo.com/" rel="nofollow">Demo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>TechCrunch Disrupt is TechCrunch's own conference, spawned from the previous TechCrunch50/40 conferences, which were joint ventures between Mike Arrington/TechCrunch, and Jason Calacanis. Jason has since declared he will start his own conference called <a href="http://launch.is/" rel="nofollow">Launch</a>.</p>

<p>Demo has been around for, I believe, two decades and many great products saw the day of light at Demo.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Twitter launched at <a href="http://sxsw.com/" rel="nofollow">SXSW</a>, possibly because it's engaging crowd got them early traction. They have many great sessions for startups, and are supposedly hugely popular to visit for startups.</p>

<p>Also, there are The <a href="http://ycombinator.com/dday.html" rel="nofollow">Y-Combinator Demo days</a>, but they're closed sessions for the selected companies and possible investors and mentors.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are lots more that are local and/or niche.</p>

<p>Being at a company that has presented at both Demo and TechCrunch50, I'm biased towards the TechCrunch conference. They're both great, but it seems like there is more buzz around TC. And since there is no fee for presenting there seem to be more of a startuppy feel to it. A sense of community, so to speak. Demo also has a lot larger companies that will launch products, and is not solely for startups. </p>
