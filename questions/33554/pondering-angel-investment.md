My startup has been bootstrapping for 4-5 months, we're at the point now, the other cofounder is working 40+ hours a week on a full time job at a company, would potential angels look down on this and not want to invest?

I am working about 25-35 hours per week on the development.

Anyone shed some light on this?

Well I think the main question angel investors will be wondering is will at least one of the co-founders be willing to quit their current job once funding is received and work full time on the project? Angel's arn't dumb and realize that you need to pay the bills. If you are boot strapping they understand you need to pay them somehow. The key is do you believe in the idea enough to commit to it full time once funding (to pay the bills) is attained?
