Ok im having trouble finding a company name that also has an available domain name. Now I want to know is it ok if I just register a company and than try and find a domain name that us not my companies name? I know this shouldn't be a problem but I was thinking since this is an internet business so wont the separation im the names work against me esp for marketing and branding?

I do believe that is totally fine. a lot of company register their name as Company A. Making a internet project called Project A.
the footer of the website usually website by company A.

You should plan it and think it well before hand. I am also having the same problem right now since the domain I wanted are all sold.

Develop a clear, simple statement describing your business;

Elements of your positioning sentences:

Name of the company or product (insert your tentative company name here), 
Category, 
Core audience, 
Key benefit, 
Key differentiating feature (technical & non-technical).

List all the words that relate to your business idea
Brainstorm business name word combinations OR

Scratch all of it and just come with web2.0 names or strange names (Colors, animals, Plants, Fruits and combination of strange name + what you have in mind)

Make sure that it doesn't contain any more than 10letters. 
Its easy to find an available domain name this way saving you bucks and shouldn't take you too long either.

It may matter for branding if your company provide services, that your company is named the same as your domain. 

If on the other hand you will be making products, you can also focus your branding on the products instead of your company name, that will also help you market your products, while still loyal costumers will take note of your company name.

As already mentioned, do a brainstorm and try come up with a company name that way.

37signals is a great example of product names not matching their domains and they've done just fine.
