If I put a bunch of time and effort into creating non-text content, namely audio and video, how will Google grasp how to index it? Is there a way to "prep" audio and video so it gets noticed like text gets noticed?

<p>This isn't a question for Startups, but regardless:</p>

<p>Google is working on <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/google-audio-indexing-now-on-google.html" rel="nofollow">Indexing Audio</a> search results. It's not something that one can rely on yet though, as it is still an immature project.</p>

Use meta data like description, title to tell Google about your audio/video. 

Example - 

    <meta name="title" content="Best Video for startups" />
    <meta name="description" content="Check this video on startups by Kenneth" />


Google is planning to "listen" to your audio/video too for analyzing but it's in a nascent stage right now.

<p><strong>Put video on YouTube and if it's relevant it'll show up</strong>.  As you put titles and descriptions on the video, it'll get indexed and if there isn't too much competition it should have a chance of showing up in the top half of the results (where Google tends to put YouTube results).  For example, do a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=how+to+tie+a+tie" rel="nofollow">Google search for "how to tie a tie"</a>.  You'll see that despite not mentioning 'video' in the search, a YouTube video for it appears (for me) in third position.  So whilst there isn't anything particularly clever in how Google does this, from a marketing point of view it works.</p>

<p>So yes, I believe it is worth spending time on video content (not as sure about audio).</p>

Indexing media, beside text and similar, is hard and currently it relies on metadata that it can gather.
For instance, a MP3 that has the artist, song name, etc. or a youtube v√≠deo that has tags.

I believe it will take a while until non-text media is indexed as easily and accurate as text is nowadays.
Text is still king and it will rule for a while...
