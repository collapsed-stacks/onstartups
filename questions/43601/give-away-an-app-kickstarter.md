I would like to be able to promote my ios app on kickstarter.  I have seen several kisckatarter projects be able to give away an app when it is release to backers.  How is this possible with apple? Wouldnt the backers still have to pay on the app store for it? how are they able to give it to them for free when they payed beforehand? Thanks!

As far as I now you have 100 coupon codes pro app version release to give away on iOS apps. So you might want to limit your kickstarter project to 100.

Either: Give 100 coupon codes away, push app update, 100 new codes to give away.
Or: Give away iTunes gift cards or reimburse buyers.
