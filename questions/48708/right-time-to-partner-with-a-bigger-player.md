I am launching my website in a month ( it gives local products info) . I was toying with the idea of partnering with a big classified ad website to show their classified ad results on my website to as an addition to my results.

Is this a good idea? & When would it be the right time to approach them? just after I launch my website? or wait for a few  months to gain traffic & then approach to them?
