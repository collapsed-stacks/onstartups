I've started a freelance web development company. Up to now all my clients have been based in Canada and I have been collecting taxes for the government.

I have been contacted by a Pub in the UK, which is looking to have a website developed. What taxation laws does a Canadian need to abide by when selling media to buyers in the UK?

You should probably talk to an accountant, but from my personal experience in the UK operating through a limited company, the only difference in terms of tax are charging Value Added Tax (VAT). If your company is in the UK and provides services or products to non-EU country, you cannot (or at least should not) charge VAT. I am guessing something similar applies to a Candian company supplying services to the UK.

Otherwise, to my (limited) knowledge, all income, regardless of its source should be taxable in your country (or any country you operate from).
