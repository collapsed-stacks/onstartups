We are in B2B business and now and then someone will send a message via our contact page with a fake name, free email, fake phone etc.

Most of the time the question itself is badly written or barely makes sense.

Is it worth bothering with these people? Do you answer all the emails or simply ignore these kind of requests?

I'd save your time and ignore it.

It could be a couple of things, but most likely, it'll be some spam operator filling in your fields and pressing send.

- If it is obviously a fake name there is no point replying. 

- If it is badly written it might be a genuine enquiry so reply.

- If if it doesn't make sense perhaps reply asking for more clarity.


In the end just use your judgement and you will be fine, you are already spotting those that are not worth replying to so continue to do that.
