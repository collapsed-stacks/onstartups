Assuming startups prefer using internet marketing to promote their services/products, I was wondering which interactive channels (display advertising, mobile marketing, email marketing, social media and search marketing campaigns) are startups using the most to start their lead generation activities.

As you might expect, it depends a lot on the business.

If the startup is in an existing category that people are already searching for, then search marketing (paid or organic) usually works pretty well.

If the industry is reasonably contained such that they frequent the same websites/blogs, display advertising on those sites can work well.

If the product itself has a social media component (like a Facebook app), then social media channels can work well.

It all depends on the target market.

For many consumer apps, an early trick is to figure out how to create a "viral loop".  That is, can you invite people to your service, and in turn have them invite people, etc.  If You can create an invitation acceptance coefficient greater than 1, then you will have a self sustaining growth model (at least for a while until conditions change.)

Think about the pop-up "share this" and "invite your contacts" features that some sites have.  Those are two easily implemented viral loop producers.

Another nice trick is for services that can be "microtargeted" (and what new startup isn't microtargeted these days).  Both Facebook and Google have tools for microtargeting advertisements.  As an example, for one of my startups, in Austin, I was able to identify the 2800 people in Central Texas who had the right demographic and psychographic profile for my product - and only target them with my meager advertising budget.

Cheapest channel (moneywise, not timewise) is clearly social media (depending on your product as well). Second comes SEO, which (if possible) should be an integral part of your product design (if it's an online service for instance).
