<p>I worked for a start up for a year and I had 1/4 of my stock options vested. I decided to exercise the options and purchased it on 8/15. I gave them the check but it was not until last week (10/12) that I received the stock certificate/paper (or whatever it is called) stating that I own the stocks. On the paper, the date is 8/15.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it too late for me to file for 83(b) election?</p></li>
<li><p>To avoid disastrous tax consequences from increase in company's valuation, what options do I have?</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. You should have filed it when you received the <em>restricted</em> stock, not when it vests. Once it vests, you own it, and the gain is capital gain anyway, you're taxed on the value at vest as ordinary income.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To avoid disastrous tax consequences from increase in company's
  valuation, what options do I have?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now? Nothing in particular. 83(b) should be filed within a month from the grant date, which has long passed.</p>

<p>From your link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>• If you have stock options, you do not need to file an 83(b) Election
  Form.</p>
  
  <p>• If you purchased/received founder’s stock and there are no
  restrictions, such as vesting, you do not need to file an 83(b)
  Election Form.</p>
  
  <p>• <em>If you purchased/received <strong>restricted</strong> stock in a
  growing startup, you should probably (about 99% of the time) file an
  83(b) Election Form</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that I'm not a licensed tax adviser or professional. When in doubt - talk to a EA/CPA licensed in your state. Do not rely on anonymous free information on open internet forums, it is worth exactly what you paid for it.</p>
