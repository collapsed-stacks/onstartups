I'm no CPA. But I used to use QuickBooks 5-10 years ago. I believe you can use it to track investor commitments and capital contributions. Insofar as current accounting standards require you to account for the cost to shareholders of compensation options, seems like QuickBooks would have the ability to track those as well. The trick, of course, is to know precisely how to account for these things, so you know how to enter them in QuickBooks. I would seek the advice of a professional accountant who was fluent with QuickBooks.

Your law firm should handle this as part of corporate records, if you are to the point of needing special software.  (all the big firms use special cap table software.)
