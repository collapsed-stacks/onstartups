I have bank accounts in US and Chile and a customer in Serbia.
The monthly bill is not that big and paypal does not operate in Serbia.

Are there some options?

Thanks.

1. Bank cashiers check not working in East Europe.
2. Wire transfer is Ok, but quite expensive.
3. Consider to use payment gateway for CC payments. It is easy, fast, low costs and everybody has a credit card. Good example for CC gateway is GP webpay (we are using it worldwide, low commision and you can use multicurrency account for it).
