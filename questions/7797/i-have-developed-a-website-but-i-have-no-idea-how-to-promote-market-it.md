First step - include link to your website in the profile.<br> This was the first thing I personally checked.  :) <br>
Do SEO. <br>
Try to talk to people who might be interested in your service on blogs and forums.<br>
Try to participate in the events for your target audience.<br>
Give your users referral bonuses.

<p>One person at a time. You must know who your ideal user is, so now you need to go pound the streets and convince them to visit.</p>

<p>When I started my blog <a href="http://LeanStartups.com" rel="nofollow">LeanStartups.com</a> I went to every networking event I could and asked 1st time entrepreneurs and more experienced founders to visit it and give me some feedback. I "pimped" it to my friends on Facebook, tweeted, commented on blogs of others. I brought in one reader at a time. This way I have an organic growth audience, not just bunch of people who show up once and never again.</p>

<p>Peldi Guilizzoni (Founder of Balsamiq) wrote an <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2008/04/18/preparing-for-launch" rel="nofollow">excellent blog post on how he ramped for launch</a>.</p>

<p>I thought the first post he referenced was one of the best - <a href="http://david.weebly.com/1/post/2008/02/press-for-startups-10-tips.html" rel="nofollow">Press for Startups: 10 Tips</a> by David Rusenko.</p>

<p>I've found that joining as many social networking sites &amp; commenting on as many blogs as possible can also help. If you do so, you want to be real, though - don't just barge in promoting your wares. Add value to the communities you join, and you'll find that people are happy to see what you're up to.</p>

<p>SEO is a good start but it's not everything you need to do. Your best bet is to apply Inbound Marketing Techniques. The best resource I have found for that is this <a href="http://inboundmarketing.com/" rel="nofollow">site</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from that, Sasha makes an excellent point about talking to people who might find your service valuable. When I mean talk, that literally means pick up the phone. Doing that via email is good as a starter but you want to get people engaged with your offering and find some champions that will tell others. Think of it as finding strategic partners.</p>

Before you market your web site, make sure it is well done.  There are many issues that I see with it, starting with I have no idea what the web site is for.

Read up on marketing a web site first, as suggested by the other people.  And while you learn about it, get a good user interface designer to look over your site.  There are many things you should change in your current design before you invite people to look at it.

I suggest you do some usability testing first. I found it hard to understand what your website is about.

The key to low-cost & fast results on usability test is in the Don't make me think book. You can find it on sensible.com

Best success

My problem is the site that I cannot figure it out what it is about. The average user will spend about less then a minute looking at your site and if you fail to capture his/her attention then he goes away. I think this is the first thing you will need to fix. Just try to explain them what your site is all about,,,
