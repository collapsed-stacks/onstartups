I have seen PMB (Private Mail Box) services from The UPS Store, etc.  I have also seen Registered Agent services.  Are there any places that do both?  One  would seem to be a natural/common extension of the other, so I'm surprised I haven't found any.

Does anyone know of any or have recommendations?  I'm in Maryland near DC.  Thanks!

I am in the process of creating an LLC in PA. I called my department of state for clarification and they told me I can use myself as the registered agent and that I'm able to use a PMB as long as it has a physical address.

I've used Harvard Business Services in the past.  They have been affordable and helpful.
