We are making a I.T based framework, which contains<br>

visual learning, <br>
MCQ-exam, <br>
student performance analytic.<br>

We think to put expert-exchange service in our business model. <br>
Here experts means the industry professional who could provide information about current technical trend, how the students can start learning to be prepared for that field..<br>
So, by this way we think that, students may get early exposer to market trend, future importance of current subjects.<br> So this may form a desire driven educational pattern, and student could start learn new practical things.

Expert-exchange is a growing model. It's based on the trending ted.com movies and various video keynotes that are growing in popularity all over the interwebs.

I would venture to say that if you don't provide some expert-level support in your education start-up, you're going to lose. People, especially students, are incredibly skeptical now. We won't believe just anybody these days. In fact, the amount of people that are purporting themselves as 'gurus', is disgusting. If you can, in fact, secure *actual experts* providing specialized and *relevant*, and ***actionable*** information then your students will not only be impressed, they will be ecstatic.

So, yes, you need expert-exchange. Whether that's in the form of teachers that are the experts, or guest webinar appearances, you absolutely must do this. It's the new model of education and will, eventually, replace traditional education as we know it.
