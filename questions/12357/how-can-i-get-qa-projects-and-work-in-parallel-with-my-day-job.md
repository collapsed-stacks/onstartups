I am working as a QA lead at a big IT firm. I have a dream to start a software company. I want to get some projects on QA and work in parallel with my job. I have people to work on QA projects. If I am successful in these projects, then I plan to get an office and continue working on the projects.

How can I get projects? And how to proceed doing projects in parallel with my job? Is it a good idea?

It sounds like you are starting or wanting to start a consulting business, which is OK. Starting as a consulting business is a great way to bootstrap a company and a great way to bring in some cash. The only problem is that it is very time consuming. Once you start having clients, you'll probably spent most of your time in projects and not able to work on anything else...

Since you have a FT job, you should consider working on the product idea you might have (software) in your free time, instead of consulting. It will help you develop your product faster, and keep you focused on your product instead of a consulting business.

If what you want to do is to start with a consulting business, then consider offering your service to the company you are working for right now, also, look at other local IT shops that you could help with your testing/QA skills, put a basic website with some contact information, look for gigs on craigslist, and other websites for freelance testing/QA opportunities, etc... also, don't forget word of mouth, make sure you leave a good impression on your clients so they recommend your work to others, it is the best way to market any business.

Good luck!

<p>Only one: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html" rel="nofollow">RELEASE EARLY RELEASE OFTEN</a></p>

<p>In short, don't wait for your application to be full of features. Whenever your software is ready with the minimum necessary structure to work try to sell it (even if building a website to sell it might be less fun than adding new features to your software). </p>

<p>Once your website selling your featureless software is launched, and I repeat only when this is done, should you continue to add new features.</p>

<p>But in the meantime:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You will know if your software is something that sells, because it's useful for  something (if it doesn't sell in its minimal condition even with the cheapest possible price, it will hardly sell even with other features). But if it sells in minimal condition you will get really self confident and it translates in being more happy while writing more code alone in your house garage for long times.</p></li>
<li><p>You will know the new features that customers really want. You won't waste time adding useless features that nobody wants and will make your application
interface counterintuitive.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestions by customers on how to
improve you software.</p></li>
<li><p>Bugs to be fixed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I agree with Ricardo, it sounds like you want to start with consulting. That can be a good way to get out on your own, but keep in mind you have to spend a lot of time looking for new business.</p>
