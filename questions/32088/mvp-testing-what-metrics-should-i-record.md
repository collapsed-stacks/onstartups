I recently launched a small MVP. It's a web app which is supposed to make file uploading easier, without the need to register, use complicated UIs or have porn popups be thrown at you ( ;) ).

Right now I have some traffic getting into the site. I'm trying to record as much as possible, but I don't understand - how can I know which metrics are **important** so I can get my validated learning running (yes, I just recently read The lean startup)?

Any ideas? Thoughts?

What do you want people to do on your website?

**1. Upload file**

-> Measure the percentage of visitors uploading a file

Work at improving this number.

**2. Share the file link with others**

-> Measure the number of visitors (other than the uploader) to download the file

Work at improving this number.

What are your assumptions? Write them down, then figure out how to measure them, then start measuring. Get a couple thousand uses then review your assumptions with measurements. Determine if you need to change your assumptions.
