In the past, I have setup several emails for my business.  For example, support@example.com, admin@example.com, sales@example.com.  From there I would make a gmail account called example@gmail.com.  Then I would setup all the emails on my domain to go to the one gmail account and allow the gmail account to send out messages in their name. This way I could monitor all of the emails from one account and it was easy to keep gmail open all day to do this.  The problem is that gmail does not allow me to keep my business email open at the same time as I have my personal email open which are two separate accounts on gmail.  So does anyone else have a better solution to monitor their business emails throughout the day?

You can have both Gmail accounts open at once.  Take a look at this blog post:

Did you try Thunderbird.... You can download, Tag, and Manage well, including monitoring RSS feeds in your industry segment, all, from the same location...
