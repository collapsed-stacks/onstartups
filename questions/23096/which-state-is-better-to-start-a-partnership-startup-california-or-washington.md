My partner and I are in the process of bootstraping a startup. we both are from Southern California. I will soon be moving to Seattle. Now we need to decide where to register our company. can you guys throw some light on which might be better either to register the startup in California or in Washington?

As far as laws and regulations go, you won't be looking at a huge difference (assuming you're doing a consumer web startup or anything else that is in a similar unregulated industry), but Washington tax laws (particularly if you end up selling the company) are a bit more favorable than CA.
