An LLC is not really a license -- it's more of a structure.

Forming an LLC is pretty easy. Just Google Forming an LLC and there are several on line services that can help you out.

The one I have used is http://www.nolo.com

An LLC is a Limited Liability Company, which is a form of a corporation that limits your liability in the event of a lawsuit and allows you to be taxed as a partnership rather than as a corporation. Depending upon the industry you are involved in, additional business licenses may be required by your state or county authorities.

A. Perform Corporate Name Search

1. Go online to the website for your State Attorney General.

2. Click on navigation for corporation information. There is a separate division of the State Attorney General that oversees corporations.

3. Click on navigation regarding information for a corporate name search.

4. Enter the preferred name for your new company and perform a search. If the results show that your preferred company name has not already been taken, you may use that name. If the name is taken you will have to choose another name and perform a search for the alternate choice.

B. File Forms to Create an LLC: 

1. Click on navigation for corporation filings found at the website of your State Attorney General.

2. Click on information for Limited Liability Company. This will take you to a web page with links for multiple forms for downloading. Forms are usually in a PDF format which will require the Adobe Acrobat Reader for viewing.

3. Download the specified forms to file an LLC for printing and complete all required information to successfully fill out the required forms. Many states allow for filling out forms online, at this point you may choose to fill out the forms rather than download.

4. Submit filing fees with completed application by mail or online. Filing fees vary from state to state.
