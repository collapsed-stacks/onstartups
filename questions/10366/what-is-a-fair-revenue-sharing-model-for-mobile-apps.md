## What is a fair revenue sharing model for mobile apps?

I build iPhone apps and I want to approach many local media outlets who have great content and interactive capabilities on their conventional web sites and bring that to the mobile space through a better mobile web site as well as native apps. (iPhone, Android, WP7) To do this I need to find a way to make the costs appealing to them.

In the last year I have been researching how newspapers have lost nearly all of their revenue due to the loss of classifieds revenue (Ebay, Craigslist) and fewer subscriptions from younger readers who have quickly opted for the free online edition. Since the online editions always compete against any other web site out there they have not differentiated themselves very well. I learned that by creating niche apps they can reach many small audiences who have very specific interests and then with that targeted audience get better revenue from ads. People interested in the arts will use one app, another app can focus on sports while another focuses on entertainment. Each of these smaller pools can start to generate revenue after some initial investment.

To fund this development I could do the typical approach of quoting the project based on an estimate of the amount of time for me to build the app with all of the requested features. If I work at my normal hourly rate of $100/hr and it takes 40 hours to complete it would be quoted at $4000. This may be a discouraging amount to pay for a single mobile app so I am going to give them a second option for revenue sharing for ads which are placed in this app. (For ads I may do AdMob or iAds)

So assume it costs $4000 for the app, what is a reasonable rate for revenue sharing? Here is one approach that I could do.

 - Charge $1000 for development
 - Revenue share at 75% up to $2000
 - Revenue share at 25% after $2000 is reached up to 24 months
 - They are expected to promote their app in their publication
 - Local businesses could be featured as a sponsor for a fee

This way their initial investment is a more accessible number and I can get revenue through the ad revenue. I understand this is a risk for me since the number of people using the app may be low for a while but over time it may increase. It may also stay at a low number. On the flip side it may become a popular app and it could reach the $2000 point quickly and I would do well at 25%.

The ad sponsor is one area where a good deal of the money could be made since ads do not typically bring in a lot of money. I could have a place available in the app for a featured sponsor who would pay to be shown there for a monthly fee. Once there are enough users the cost for the "featured sponsor" would go up and I would get the 75% or 25% cut.

It is still hard for me to project the level of use this app will get and what sort of revenue these ads could generate.

What do you think? Is 75/25 split at 50% of the total quote reasonable?

The ads will come from the local publication. It's an added feature for a classified advertiser, and its unclear how much extra an advertiser would be prepared to pay. It might be nothing, but it might be the difference for the publisher between selling the advertising space and not selling it. It is going to be hard to track the value of that advertising.

How about a rental model?

Publisher gives away/promotes app for free, puts as many ads as he/she likes on the device, and pays you $x/month for the exclusive privilege within a geographic area. 

You can then sell substantially the same app (covering a different geographic area) to other publishers. 

I think you have to take a chance on the development cost, however. You need to own
the app.

And research the systems and software used by small newspapers to handle classified advertising. If these systems offer the right type of feed, the effort required by a publisher to utilize the product might be small. Otherwise the costs and inconvenience of the added feature may be high.

What would make this venture pass this share contemplation stage and actually launch? That's probably the better angle to loo at the issue.

I find the revenue sharing idea nice, although it doesn't give you anything if they don't market their apps properly. In such a case you lose out. Given that most apps don't take off and make much, I would say that your rolling the dice as those who give you their ideas aren't risking alot, but you are giving your time based on the speculation that their app will do well. Even really good apps will go unnoticed if no one knows they're out there. I would recommend keeping away from speculating on an app when the other side hasn't invested as much time as you, since it's very easy for them to give up on the marketing and sales aspect that is very time consuming and critical to success. I've used sites like taskcity to find alot of jobs for my team and we have yet to take one that involves revenue sharing as it is too speculative.
