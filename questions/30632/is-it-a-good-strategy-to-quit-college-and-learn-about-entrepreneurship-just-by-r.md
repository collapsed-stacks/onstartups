<p>I found college very valuable. Not just for the education, but for the experience and the people I have met there.  I started my current business with a friend I made in college and have started minor side projects with other college friends.</p>

<p>I would strongly suggest you stil read books on entrepreneurship, business, marketing, sales, economics and personal development whether you go to college or not.  I didn't started reading these types of books until I was 4 years out of college (once I started my business) and I wished I would have started sooner. They give you a lot of motivation, insight, and knowledge that would take you years and years of actual experience to learn.  </p>

<p>If you did that while going to college you could really motivate and influence others around you to start ventures together.  </p>

<p>Or, if you don't go to college use this knowledge and find some local meetups (meetup.com) or places you can get together with like minded individuals to create something.  OR - if you don't really care about the piece of paper that says you graduated and you plan to pave your own path to greatness just take the classes you want to take.  If you aren't working towards a degree you can often take classes at a University or college for the same price or less! Just take the classes that interesting or that might help you develop a good network of friends.</p>

<p>One of the most important things about being an entrepreneur is your network. You need to associate with smart, successful, like minded people. These mentors/friends/classmates etc. will help you along the way. :]</p>

<p>Here is the reading list for <a href="http://personalmba.com/best-business-books/" rel="nofollow">the personal MBA</a> great list of books.</p>

No. Finish college *and* read the books.

My rec is don't quit college! Having spent almost 20 years in education, I'd wager that this old saying may apply to you: "You don't know what you don't know" (yet). 

The odds are you will change the direction of your career several times. Look at at your time in college as not just text books and random tests, but a unique opportunity to experiment with career building and school-to-life skills. I wish in my 20's I had given myself more flexibility to really explore different pathways and degree options.  Back in the early 80's, I was purposeful and driven, but with a narrow focus.

A university or college environment is a great place to test drive what your passionate about.  And to be a successful entrepreneur, I'd say passion for what you're doing has to be at the top of the list! I'm still learning, but that much I know for sure.

Ironically, the most important thing you may learn in college may not have anything to do with your degree.

Good that you are asking the question!

I would say no. School is a great place to start building your future network and discuss your  future plans with your professional mentors. If your not happy by the level of education your school provides, try maybe thinking of switching to other more competitive institution, but my advice is don't drop your education.

For me personally the school wasn't really about boosting my entrepreneurial drive as it was more theory than practical skills I learned there, however I have to say I met some really clever people with whom I still maintain network, that been very beneficial for mentoring my career growth.

This is the ultimate "short term thinking" reasoning. It amounts to throwing away the one clear opportunity that you will have in your lifetime to get an education. You are assuming that the college education is almost worthless and the startup will be an assured success. 

Everyone else has covered the broadening aspects of college. I'll add one career factor that nobody has mentioned: credentials. 

Today, everyone is programmed to say that academic credentials don't matter, but absolutely don't believe it. Virtually every desirable job in our society requires a four year degree. What is left are low end service jobs, low paid manufacturing jobs... you get the idea. Let's take a perspective 20 years in the future: without a college degree, and with a failed startup "back when those things were a big deal" - you are at the bottom rung of society. 

Unless you are ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE that you will NEVER require permanent employment, you will be killing your future career potential by not attending college. 

Also, you will become a better manager and will gain credibility from others in business by having a degree. I've had the experience of working as a contractor for a couple of company owners who didn't complete college or never attended. It REALLY shows. Their reasoning is usually short term and often flawed.

For an average person i would say go to college for all the reasons the other answers here have given. On the other hand, if you are an exceptionally smart and gifted person then maybe college is not the best use of your time. 

It also depends upon what college you are going to, what other opportunities you will be giving up by making a 4 year commitment to college and how you use your time in college.

In general going to college is a better choice for most people, but there are exceptional cases in which the contrary is a better choice.

College can teach you a lot about discipline regardless if, IMHO, it's a waste if there is no motivation to go. If you seem like the type of person that never finishes things you start, then college might be the best option.  

It might be also good to do some of the daily day-to-day work of the field/industry you want to be in. 

Always read books.

I went to school for business, but now do front-end work, and all of my learning came from books, articles, blogs, paul irish and friends :), etc.

I have fared far better in a full time job without any help from a college degree. My friends who went to college are 1) still in college and paying tuition or on grants 2) out of college and almost done paying off loans for their MBA's and BA's by working as janitors or are unemployed.

Good luck if you enter college these days. The prospects aren't so great when you finish.
