E.g. there is AutoCAD and Corel Draw installed on my Notebook. I bought those Apps some time ago. Can I let others use it and charge for it (per minute?)?

<p><strong>It will depend on the terms of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license_agreement" rel="nofollow">End User License Agreements (EULA)</a> for the applications in question.</strong></p>

<p>Generally speaking, the answer is <strong>no</strong>. You would be violating the terms of the license agreements; several large software providers have default license terms to prohibit this. For example with Microsoft products you need a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hosting/en/us/licensing/splabenefits.aspx" rel="nofollow">Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA)</a>, not their common retail version EULA, before you can 'rent out' Microsoft software.</p>

<p>Your <em>intent</em> would likely matter as well. If you do it just once, to help a friend, nobody is likely to care. If you're essentially trying to build a recurring business primarely based on giving people cheap access to AutoCAD without AutoCAD seeing any money, then the courts would likely go harder on you.</p>

<p>So, to clarify:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What you mention is not possible with the regular retail versions of most software.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the retail EULA of the specific software in question as your first step, and see what it says.</p></li>
<li><p>In principle, if the retail EULA is prohibiting multi-user use, then nothing is stopping you from approaching the software vendor and obtain the software with a different license (and price). With license terms which permit this use you could then rent out their software.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As always, please go see a qualified lawyer about this, don't take the words of a layman as me. But one thing, as an entrepreneur I will say don't try to build a business that is very directly positioned against the interests of large software vendors -- they have large legal teams and are not afraid to use them.</p>
