I am in the process of building a startup and have a question regarding the name. The website I have chosen uses the .me TLD, and I intend for that to be part of the name. For example, say my site is Foo.me

Another larger company exists and has Foo.com, and there is a copyright for the Foo product - however, from what I understand names must be trademarked and are not copyrighted. My product is NOT a copy of Foo product, and I intend the product to be known as "Foo.me" . I cannot find any listing in the trademark database for "Foo". Am I safe in assuming my product name is safe from any infringement on Foo.com's name and/or product?

You are correct that you can't copyright a company name and that you need to be concerned with trademark law.

In order to answer your question, I need to know:

 - The real name of your company
 - What you do
 - What Foo.com does

If Foo is a common word, then you are more likely to be ok unless Foo.com is a very strong mark like Apple.  If Foo is an unusual or made-up word, then you are probably not ok.

If what you do is very different from what Foo.com does, then you are probably ok.  E.g., if Foo.com sells software and you sell cookies.  If you both sell software, then it is a closer call.

It does not help you much that there is not a trademark registration for Foo.  Foo.com has rights to Foo merely by using the name.

The devil is in the details...
