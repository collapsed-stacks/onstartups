I am working on a project which is basically a Notification System or in other words sort of Lan Instant Messenger for mid-size companies, in which a person can update the status of the project (like twitter) and the others working on the same project will be notified, they can also add their comments. I am implementing it in C# & it'll be windows based application. I have been asked to include some more features in the application, so if you got any advice or suggestion in order to extend my application please do mention...

Thanks

<p>You're giving a very vague overview on an idea you're working on without an actionable and answerable question about starting a company. Can you be more clear about a specific question you have about your startup?</p>

<p>From what I gather - You should setup a <a href="http://www.uservoice.com" rel="nofollow">UserVoice</a> account and let your customers vote on features. This is the easiest way to get feedback on your idea from the people who will actually buy it.</p>

Im  not going to write a full prd for you, but here are some features that would be nice to have:

 1. An application like this begs to be written in Adobe air.  Adobe air allows for socket programming, and will support a greater market including MACs.  The reason this is quite critical is that it will allow you to have an additional selling point, and will actually allow to cater to schools, design firms, and others that may have a few macs or be mac only.
 2. Group chat, this is important for online collab. 
 3. To dos, assignments, and tasks (with heiarchy or parent tasks)
 4. Reporting - Progress, estimations, etc
 5. Work clock.  Great for sub contractors, where you have them Punch in and out.  Plus good to have if you are the type of guy who likes to goof off on sites like this while at work. 
 6. Centeralized server sync.  (again air with rest would be a good fit)
 7. FREE, + ad supported pricing model.  Or a more robust version for a monthly fee. (try to host this yourself rather than requing an install of the server app)
 8. Theming, and a very elegant UI.  (sizzle sells)
 9. Intergration, try to have an open api for messaging.  It would be cool if my web app could create a task and assign it to the right person based on an event.  
 10. Drop the twitter.

A feature I would like to see is the ability to set up this application without any centralized server apart from a file server. This would ease the setup enormously in many companies.
