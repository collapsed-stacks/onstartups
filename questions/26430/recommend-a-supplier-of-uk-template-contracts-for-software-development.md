I'm looking to purchase a template contract for delivering fixed scope/price software development projects, dealing with IP issues and everything else that needs to be taken into consideration.

I can find several options via Google but generally you have to buy the contract before you get to read it.  I'd prefer a recommendation from somebody who has actually bought/used said contract.

I found a [similar question][1] on here but I am specifically looking for something tailored to the law of England & Wales.  Any suggestions?

I have used simply docs for a number of years for various template contracts in my small software company

http://www.simply-docs.co.uk/

I had a terrible experience and wasted a lot of money trying to get a custom contract out my solicitors, which I had to throw away in the end anyway. I was surprised by the extent to which a major commercial firm really didn't understand how projects get delivered these days.

It's likely that one of the sites you found was http://www.template-contracts.co.uk/

I have not yet purchased contracts from them but I intend to.  My experience with their support team was great - I had some fairly technical questions about copyright assignment that they answered unambiguously and promptly.  I will update with more info when I have purchased.

If you have non-standard needs, e.g. IP complexities, then you'll probably want to pay a lawyer.

<p>I know of someone who has a sub with <a href="http://www.simply-docs.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.simply-docs.co.uk/</a>.  The documents themselves are what I would expect although doesn't prove what support they have behind them.  Plenty of docs are updated though which suggests its not in any way dormant.</p>
