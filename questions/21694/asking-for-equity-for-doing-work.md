## Asking for equity for doing work

I've been contacted by a early start-up company (2 people) to do work in rails for a product that they could potentially market to dentists.  The person who contacted me (one of the two owners) knows me for last 3 years and works with me for his 9 to 5 job.  I was told that there might not be any money upfront, and I'm assuming there might not be any money at all if the product doesn't take notice.

I would love to do the work as it will keep my skills honed and I'd gain some experience as well.  However, since there is no money upfront this task doesn't sound like a consulting or contracting work.  Would I be out of line to ask for equity, not for the whole company but only for this project/product?  I will just make some % of the total they make on this product.  For me I see two benefits in this, I've been thinking of opening my Consulting company and this would be a great way to get my first client and If I do good enough work on this product then I can showcase it on my company's profile. 


I've thought about the negotiation conversation and what the other person might say.  They might say they can just get someone else who won't want equity.  However, who would be willing to work on a product without any up front or hourly money? Furthermore, they are aware of my competence in helping them deliver a finished product as well. 

Please give me some suggestions whether asking for equity in this case would be out of line or would I be putting an axe to my foot by asking for equity?

I'm never really an advocate of doing that amount of work for free for any reason.

You should get some kind of immediate compensation for your efforts.  It can be cash, stock, all-you-can-carry office supplies, whatever.  

We've all heard the story of the struggling little company that went on to be huge, and then fairly rewarded all the people who had selfishly contributed to its success, but that is mostly a story.  The odds are literally 10,000:1 that this company never produces a dollar in profit.  There are similar odds that they do produce a profit but never pay you for various reasons (you helped on product X, but that morphed into product Y which is what really made money so we don't owe you anything).

I would say ask for options in the company.  The formal company, not just some percentage of the project you're working on. Do NOT (IMO) ask for straight equity, because if you are granted actual shares there are accounting issues that go along with that for tax purposes that you'd probably rather not deal with.  Along with that, setup a structure with them where you get the first $XXX of the product sales and then .0x% of future sales (not profits) from the product.  None of this is, IME, unfair or unreasonable for any company that has any real shot at success.

The other option is that you do the work for free just for your own personal networking benefits with the guy you work with, but my bets are on that not having much long term value.

As a startup founder, I would be reluctant to give equity to anyone who won't be on the team full-time.  You've only got so many points to give.

Another solution might be to ask for an option.  For example "I get the right to buy 1% of the company for $10k anytime in the next 10 years."  That way, if it turns into a $5m company, you can cash in for a nice $40k score....but meanwhile they haven't given up equity in the beginning stages.

The most common thing, however, is to do the work for an increased fee that can be paid back after the company is producing revenue.  Something like "I would normally charge $10k to do this....$5k to do this for a friend, because it is a lot of work.  But I know you guys are just getting started...so how about this....a contract where I do the work now, and you pay me $1k/month for 8 months AFTER you reach $x in revenue.  That way I get something extra for my risk and you get to pay over time once your company is ready for it."

Bottom line---there are a lot of ways to be flexible and creative!  If you do good work, they're very likely to turn to you often when they need work done (and can pay for it..we hope!).  But I'd get SOMETHING out of the deal more than building your portfolio.   

Sorry for the ramble and the made-up numbers...I've seen this situation a lot and this is all IMO from my experience.

Let me get this straight, they cannot afford to pay you (a small salary or hourly wage), and they cannot afford to give you Equity?

Why dont you build your own Dentist software?  What is so special about these two guys that you cannot do alone?  I want to you start and realize your value. 

Most unfunded startups do actually give out generous amounts of equity.  Its usually done on a performance basis.  My advice to you is to go for a combination of $ and Equity.  If they cannot afford it, then they cannot afford to launch, sell or do much with the product.  You are looking at a lottery ticket at that point, with low chances of success.

Maybe its best for you to spend the time you would with these two clowns working on something you can do alone, something smaller, and "closer to the money"
