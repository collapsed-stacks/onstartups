I have just started a company and making sure I get all the phone calls about the business is vital.  I am going abroad for 2 months and need to be able to answer these calls.  Is there any way to use an online service such as Google Phone or Skype and have it use my phone number and have messages go to some online voicemail box?

The other way around. Divert all calls from your regular number to your Google Voice or Skype number, and then have Skype/Google Voice available when you travel.
