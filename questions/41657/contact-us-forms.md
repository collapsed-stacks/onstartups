Are "Contact Us" forms still relavant to small businesses/startups or have other more social means (facebook, twitter, etc) become the preferred method of contact.

Yes.

Based on nature of your business, customers may need to interact with you **privately**. Social media isn't efficient for private communications.

I'll only contact a company "directly" using their contact information on their own website. Social media is great - but for different purposes.

I personally like contact forms on websites, makes things really simple and there will always be customers who appreciate that.

Have you been out there in the real world?

Not "everyone is on Facebook". There are many people who don't use Facebook, Tweeter and other social media. If you remove the direct contact option, then they won't be able to contact you and will move on to the next company.

Keep the contact form. It will outlive Facebook, Tweeter and the rest of that band.

Yes, many people would like to speak with you. Facebook isn't a place where you can ask the company privately.

You may publish your corporate contact email and/or phone number instead of a contact form. The latter is often used as a simple spam shield.

We thought it wouldn't matter. We had a Facebook, twitter, etc. we added a contact form and have gotten several sales leads from it. Depending on who your potential customers are, it can help. It's not hard to do, so you should just have one.

It's probably a good idea to have a more formal communication model, but social media can certainly play a huge role for short and casual conversations.

It's not difficult to find or create a contact form, and they are often central components to certain businesses such as web design companies that allow the submission of project requests and businesses that expect their customers to use a (customized and enhanced) contact form to schedule appointments.

Quite simply, contact forms are generally easy to implement and worth the small effort.

Yes. Personally I prefer direct email address than contact form. If I wrote some message to website owner, then I have all information in my email box.

Like other said. Social channels are dedicated to other purposes.
