We're ready to announce technology preview of our product.  Our current marketing plan consists of contacting a number of industry bloggers, news sites, and posting on various industry forums (we have a B2B product)...

Is it better to start this process Sunday night so that Monday morning everyone comes in to emails in their Inboxes?  Is it better to do it Monday afternoon so that the morning rush of emails clear?  Perhaps Tuesdays+, so that we're not competing on Monday with everyone else's announcements?

When is it best to do it to get maximum attention from bloggers & news editors and readers?

Thanks!

<p>Hunting around Google, I suggest you look at these two links:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marketinggum.com/the-best-time-of-day-to-tweet-and-how-often-to-post-to-twitter/" rel="nofollow">Best time of day to tweet</a></p>

<p><a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/06/15/when-is-the-best-time-and-day-to-post-on-your-blog/" rel="nofollow">Best time and day to post on your blog</a></p>

<p>These will give you a good idea of when you should release your news for social media.</p>

<p>There's also <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.734656.8" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a> on <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/users/4335/joel-spolsky">Joel</a>'s blog which goes into Best day/time to send email announcement.</p>

Aside from avoiding major holidays and events (World Cup/Olympics), you can't control how quickly or how it will spread out. So it should be when you are ready to launch...

Time it to go out at 8:45 AM on Monday. That way it will be at the top of everyone's mailboxes / feeds at a when they're refreshed from the weekend...
