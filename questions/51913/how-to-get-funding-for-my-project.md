<p>First I must apologize for the generic title, second Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

<p>I have two projects that I think have potential, I have done my research and there isn't anything like that on the market as of now. I have spoken to a few people who might be end users of the products and they are really excited about it.</p>

<p>I am currently working on only one project as I feel that is the easiest to get out the door and start generating interest.</p>

<p>I am the only person working on it and development is not my core skill so I have had to hire a freelancer for the development but he didn't do a satisfactory job.</p>

<p>Till now I have used funds from my savings to pay for the development of the ideas but now I am running low.</p>

<p>I thought about crowd funding but all the crow funding sites require me to offer somekind of incentive and this has me stumped.</p>

<p>The project i am working on is community oriented, totally free to use and I intend to keep it impartial by not siding with any of the major players related to the product and hence there really isn't any incentive I can provide other than mentioning their names on the products thank you page.</p>

<p>I was wondering if people out here could provide some suggestions or some direction.</p>

<p>If crowdfunding is not possible and VCs or banks will not give you money because the idea poses no really solid returns, then you only have 1 option:</p>

<p>Learn to code on your spare time and then build the app yourself. Use the extra money from your day job to finance hosting, etc. of the app.</p>

<p>If the project is small enough, you should be developing it yourself. Any talented developer will not price themselves at $10-15 an hour and you can expect to pay a talented developer at least $30+ an hour (even in places where $30 is a lot of money, the most talented developers know that they can deliver, so they will price around the same amount as the US/Europeans).</p>

<p>There are also many 'tools' that make developing apps much easier (some are literally drag and drop) so if your app is simple enough, you can build it through those platforms.</p>

<p>I did mention above that there is only "1 option". However, there is also the option of getting finance and backing from friends and family, but based on the description of what you're trying to do, I would bootstrap this on my own with my own financing.</p>
