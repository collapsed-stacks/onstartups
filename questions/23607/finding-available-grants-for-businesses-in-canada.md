What is a good resource for grants available to business in Canada?

Startups are preferable due to the nature of this site, but any would do. Outside of waiting until their announced in the paper, my research has netted few results.

Honestly, your best bet is to give your local government agencies a call to introduce yourself, and they will be able to point you in the right direction. For example, on PEI, you'd want to call Innovation PEI - http://www.peibusinessdevelopment.com/

There's all kinds of programs that can help startups. You just need to talk to the right people.
