There are a number of formation websites. (ie http://www.companiesmadesimple.com). I was wondering why you would use one of them rather than just using the companies house website?

(I'm based in the UK)

There are two parts to forming a Ltd company in the UK

 - A) Writing up the statutory documents (Memorandum and Articles of Incorporation).
 - B) Submitting them to Companies House (the govt department that runs all Ltd company registrations)

The Articles of Incorporation are the documents that describe the company legal structure. For most 'simple' Ltd companies these follow a fairly standard format and there are many many sources to get boiler-plate documents where you just fill in the blanks. For something more complex you can get custom ones written up (for a fairly heft lawyers fee)

A) Can be found all over the place - the website you listed, WH Smiths book section and a gazillion others.

B) Can only be done at Companies House.

I don't believe that there is any advantage of doing A) at Companies House. Its something that they have only fairly recently started doing in partnership with another org (BusinessLink) and I suspect its just an attempt to 'cash in' on passing traffic - their position would be untenable if there were any favourable terms.
