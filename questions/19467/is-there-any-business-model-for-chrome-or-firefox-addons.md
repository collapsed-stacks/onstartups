I want develop pretty advanced add-on for Chrome (and later for Firefox). I plan to sell it. And i am sure users will pay. But i have some apprehensions. There no add-ons in chrome or firefox add-ons directory which is not free, so, the question - is it possible to promote own commercial add-on by add-on with reduced functionality (or some nag screens) using standard channels for browser add-ons - why isn't anyone doing this (it is really a big market)??? Is there some real limitations for such business models for add-on writers (except psychological)?

I dont know how much of a market there are for theses yet.  With so many free extensions it might be tough to convince your buyers to even pay a small amount unless what you build is of very high value.  

I know with google chrome "apps" you could essentially rework your web app, and make it available as a google app.  

The only extension I would pay for is FireBug.   Other than that I have not seen anything worthy of even thinking about charging.  So be careful.

If your product is not heavily tied to a browser, consider a different route.

You may not be able to make money selling your add-ons, but with your proven experience, you might make lots of money writing custom add-ons for other people who need them.

I used to do contract programming to write browser plug-ins using the NPAPI (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) and ActiveX (IE) APIs. There aren't a lot of people who have a track record of doing things like this well, so if a company needs this work done, you might be able to charge them a lot of money.
