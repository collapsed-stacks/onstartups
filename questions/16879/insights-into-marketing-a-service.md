Does anyone have any suggestions on where to find insight into marketing a specific service?  This is a general question.  I am wondering if there are any resources (web sites, books, ect..) out there that help entrepreneurs better understand how consumers buy specific services?

<p>A bit broad of a question, but take a look at Seth Godin's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0043RT8HC" rel="nofollow">all marketers are liars</a></p>

<p>Here's a ( slightly dated) view on the complexities of selling services:

We need just a little more information on what kind of service you are going to market.

At any rate, assuming it is a technology service, I highly recommend "Five Myths Of Consumer Behavior" by Smethers and France.Also, "Think Like Your Customer" by Stinnett is a good read.
