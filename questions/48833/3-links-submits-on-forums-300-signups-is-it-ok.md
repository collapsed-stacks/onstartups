If you are just starting out you need to see if anyone in your target market actually finds your product useful. If they feel its useful check if they are willing to buy it at a price you can atleast breakeven. Try to contact your target customers and let them know about product(try to meet in person if possible, people hate cold calls). You will get a better idea about your product.  

If you are way past your first sale customer feedback will answer your question. You need to put some efforts to get your feedback.
