I am looking to provide rental items online, however it is important that I can take a deposit that will be returned after the usage of the item.  I am aware of capture delay although my understanding is this is only viable for 28 days on Credit Cards and 7 on Debit Cards.  Is there a means of extending this or another solution I have overlooked.

If you use paypal as your merchant account, refunds are free meaning you get a refund of the actual merchant charges you pay.

So after doing some research it seems that the best option for this kind of thing is ACH payment firms such as braintree, who provide pre-authorization transactions, where money can be ring fenced for a certain period of time and then actioned if required or released.  Some places call it catch and release type payments.
