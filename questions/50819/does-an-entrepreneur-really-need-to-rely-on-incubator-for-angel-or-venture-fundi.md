Does an entrepreneur really need to rely on incubator for angel or venture funding?
I feel if an entrepreneur is already confident of a business and has sound business plan, should be given angel investment without going through accelerator. Please give feedback.

**No, it is not necessary at all to go through an incubator to find a VC or an Angel investor. It's just one of the ways** (and even a less frequent one).

In short: **there are advantages**. The startup get more publicity and the investor knows, that the risk is smaller as the people from the incubator **a)** already did some screening (only the most viables startups access the incubators) and **b)** the startup members get advice and mentoring so again, their "chance to survive" increases.

But still: 

**a)** it's not because a startup didn't participate to any incubator that the business idea / team / execution / ... are wrong or worse!

**b)** there is really not enough incubators to take all viable and probably profitable startups in

**If the startup presents a good opportunity and does a minimum of marketing (or some search for investor), it will be found by VC or by an angel. They know how to find and evaluate an opportunity...**
