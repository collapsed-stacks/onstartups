I was going to develop an app for facebook and was wondering what is Facebook's take on your advertising money that you earn. Is it like Apple's 70/30 or is it different.

If you sell your own ads or use a private ad network, FB does not take a percentage of that ad revenue.  They will however continue to run their own ads alongside yours (in the normal places that the run ads on the page).

On the other hand, if you charge users for the apps using FB Credits, then FB does take a 30% cut.
