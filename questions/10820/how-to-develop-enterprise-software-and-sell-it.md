What framework or platform is commonly used to develop enterprise software?

I would also like some reference materials on how to sell such software.

Common enterprise software is mainly developed in JavaEE or .NET frameworks, although surprisingly Ruby is gaining some traction in the enterprise space.

Because of the complexity involved in enterprise software, these tools provide APIs for security, scalability and manageability.

Selling enterprise software is tough. It has a long sale cycle, however, the advent of SaaS has made it a lot easier. If you are selling Saas, you need to be good at marketing.

Why do you start with Enterprise? If you are interested in business software -- start with small business and learn from there. The difference between the two are:

 1. less features
 2. less liability
 3. cheaper to sell (yep)

They are 2 big separate questions.
Using frameworks is always faster and safer but you might need to build your own APIs and maybe frameworks too and I think if you are asking about how to develop enterprise software, it is too early to think about selling it.

Great question. 

I think more importantly than the technology platform, do you know any solid developer(s)?

I would suggest using whichever platform that you or your trusted developer is most familiar with (assuming it's something mainstream like Rails, J2EE, Python/Django, PHP...)

This will help you move fast, which is very important. 

These days, it's not so much about which platform is better, it's really how you actually use it.

No matter which kind of software, the very first step to market software online is submitting software to as many as download sites or directories as possible. As it is time-consuming, you may use a paid submission tool for sumitting your software to download sites.

<p>Don't start with delivery of the solution. What problem do you want to solve? And will that problem be something that adds value to the customer if you solve it? Even if you tick the boxes on solving a relevant problem, you must be able to inspire action to buy your solution. But first start with what problem do you want solve.</p>
