I run a SaaS startup. People pay monthly, 3 different plans, all under $100/month. I'm going to be talking with someone who is interested in being a "marketing partner" and "private label" (quoted per his words from an e-mail). I plan on still selling this service to the same niche this client is in, and to other niches.

I've read this:

http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/9562/got-an-offer-to-white-label-one-of-my-products-what-do-i-do

About the client:
- He's in a very specific niche 
- I have a conference call set up next week with him

My questions for the client that I plan on asking:
- Do you want me to provide support? 
- I'll add bug fixes and improve the software over time (it's a minimum viable product right now). I decide on what changes get added
- What pricing structure do you want to set up?  (I wonder, is it better that I ask him for this, or if I just set something... eg. should I set the first number/guidelines?)


Things I need to watch out for/planning on doing:
- I'm hosting the code (it's an online service) on my systems, he doesn't get access to any of that (no need, and it just complicates things)
- I need to talk to an attorney about a EULA and drawing up a private label agreement (is that what they're called?)
- If he lets me keep all the profits (seemed like he meant this in our e-mail discussion, but unsure) - I'll just white label/set it up for him... but if not, I imagine I need to charge something to white label it, and a percentage to take from sales. Not sure how to determine that percentage, maybe 10% for him.


Questions for you:
- Am I reasonable in my thinking/thought process?
- Who would normally control who gets the money, him or myself? eg. people pay to him and he pays me, or people pay me and I pay him? (assuming he wants percentage of money)
- Any tips on finding a site that that has agreements? or do I *really* want to go through an attorney on this?
- How is revenue normally shared? Does the private label always want some money, or are there instances where they don't want any money and they just want to offer something to their community under their name to better their brand?
- Anything else I should know? I'll do some more Googling.

Thank you!

Without knowing more, it is safe to assume that person who is labelling your software and selling it for you would be looking for a percentage of the sale.  Only in a few narrow situations would he be interested in passing on the whole fee to you - e.g:

- He is a consultant and can sell consulting time off of implementing your software.  

- He has his own solution and needs yours to fill a gap in that using your software.

I can't really foresee the 'bettering the brand' situation you mentioned.

I would want to understand whether he falls into a situation such as the above, or whether he is hoping to sell your software on it's own merits and for it's own revenue stream.  If the latter, the number he wants could vary, but I bet his starting point is closer to a 90%/10% split *in his favour* than in yours!   (IMO 10% does sound low for a $100 product - you'd pay more to affiliates, let alone to partners who are actively selling.)

The concern for me is that you are selling into the same niche or industry.  Such deals would usually make more sense where he sells into a niche that is outside of your core competency and immediate plans, therefore opening up a new market and giving him scope to add more value and add a bigger or worthwhile fee.  

The shared industry also thing impacts the legal situation since you can't draw clear distinctions over who owns the lead.  What if you talk to someone and then he comes in and closes the deal.  Who should be credited if the lead closes?  I would definetly consult a lawyer on this stuff.
