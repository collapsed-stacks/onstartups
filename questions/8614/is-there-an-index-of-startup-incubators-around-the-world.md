Is there a list of places like the YCombinator, CapitalFactory etc arranged by their geographic operating regions?

<p>The most recent list I've seen also provides the application deadlines for different startup incubators: <a href="http://kaljundi.com/2010/02/19/upcoming-startup-incubator-deadlines/" rel="nofollow">http://kaljundi.com/2010/02/19/upcoming-startup-incubator-deadlines/</a></p>

<p>And Robert Shedd has tried to round up all that he can find at:
<a href="http://blog.shedd.us/321987608/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.shedd.us/321987608/</a> - His commenters have contributed even more.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those not led to Answers.OnStartups.com from his recent blog post, our own Jason Cohen <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/capitalfactory-2010.html" rel="nofollow">is a mentor and investor</a> in <a href="http://www.capitalfactory.com/" rel="nofollow">Capital Factory</a>, an Austin, TX-based incubator. And Dharmesh is a mentor for <a href="http://www.techstars.org/mentors/boston/" rel="nofollow">TechStars in Boston</a>.</p>

@Scott and @JayNeely - I'm glad that my post was added as a link to this question.  I see that you both think there's a need for something more as far as listing/cataloguing accelerator programs around the world.  Would love to get your thoughts as far as what could be added or how the current list could be extended.  Feel free to reach out with any ideas.  Thanks!

Xconomy publishes a guide to venture incubators in the U.S., with information on geographic location, alumni companies, application deadlines, class sizes, and the like. The online preview of this year's document is here. http://www.xconomy.com/national/2010/06/24/startup-school-round-two-the-2010-xconomy-guide-to-venture-incubators/. Also on that page is a link to buy the full, PDF version of the document.
