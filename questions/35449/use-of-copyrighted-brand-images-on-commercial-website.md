I can't seem to find any exact language on using a company's copyrighted logos on a website.  I am going to make a website for a business who distributes products related to a large soda company.  What I need is to use an image or two of the soda company's logo to show that this new business distributes their products.  It seems this soda company's legal terms on their sites are somewhat confusing(surprise).  What I don't understand is how any large company would care that their logo is being used while trying to sell their products.  Is this a legal gray area of sorts; would I need to pay to use their logo on this company's website?

If the website is for an official distributor that has an active distribution agreement and the logos are used to showcase the product offering it *shouldn't* be a problem. Your client can (and should) consult your account manager at the large soda company with such questions because the company may have particular display rules (e.g. minimal size, alignment, proximity to other elements, etc) that were designed to reinforce the brand image.

The agreement between the distributor and the soda company almost certainly has provisions related to use of the soda company's logos and other trademarks. You and your client need to start there.

You are probably fine to use the logo of the soda company. Though we agree with the comment made above that checking with the brand manager for the soda company to verify using the logo image is permitted for use on your site would be wise to do.  That way you would have an email or written backup in case your use of the logo was ever called into question in a DCMA take down.  If you were using the logo for editorial purposes, you would have been covered under fair use, but particularly because your use of the logo is business related, we would recommend covering all your bases.
