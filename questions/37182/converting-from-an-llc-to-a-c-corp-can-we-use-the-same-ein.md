<p>No. You'll likely need a new EIN. Per the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98011,00.html" rel="nofollow">IRS website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, businesses need a new EIN when their ownership or structure has changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Partnerships</p>
  
  <p>You will be required to obtain a new EIN if any of the following statements are true.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>You incorporate. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The following EIN document created by the IRS may also be helpful: <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1635.pdf" rel="nofollow">Understanding Your EIN</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Someone is likely to point out that the OP has an LLC, not a partnership. Please note the following from the same website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</p>
  
  <p>An LLC is an entity created by state statute. The IRS did not create a new tax classification for the LLC when it was created by the states; instead IRS uses the tax entity classifications it has always had for business taxpayers: corporation, partnership, or disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, referred to as a “disregarded entity.”  An LLC is always classified by the IRS as one of these types of taxable entities. </p>
