<p>Is it possible to start a business with a product who's sole purpose is integrating with Microsoft Office without paying Microsoft any tribute? Or would I have to be heavily involved with Microsoft from the start?</p>

<p>I started doing this when I started out and there are only a few restrictions, trademark use ect. If you choose to distribute via the office store they will obviously take a percentage as with all other app companies.</p>
