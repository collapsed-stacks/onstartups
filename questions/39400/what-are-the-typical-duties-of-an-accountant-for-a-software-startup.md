<p>I would not advise you to pay an accountant to do your bookkeeping. You should hire a bookkeeper to do your bookkeeping. An accountant's hourly rate is much higher than a bookkeeper's hourly rate, and bookkeeping is a fairly straightforward thing, so it's not one of those things you benefit from paying extra for.</p>

<p>Some accountants will have bookkeepers on staff, which makes it easy. When you interview an accountant ask her about this.

<p>Now, to your question:</p>

<p>The things an accountant will handle for a small software startup are pretty much the same as for other companies, just at a smaller scale. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up your books and creating your <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/13014/help-on-some-basic-accounting-terms/13025#13025">Chart of Accounts</a>.

<li>Closing out your books at the end of the year.</li>
<li>Filing your tax returns.</li>
<li>Quarterly taxes.</li>
<li>Payroll.</li>
<li>Provide you with guidance on which business structure may work best for you, how to properly register your business with your government, and many other "just getting started" type of tax advice.</li>
<li>Advise you on tax laws, if for some reason it is important for you to know.</li>
<li>Help you with strategic financial and tax decisions. </li>
<li>Suggest ways you can legally lower your tax burden.</li>
</ul>

There are a lot of combinations depending on whether you are hiring a bookkeeper or an accounant. Bookkeeper will only maintain your books based on business transactions. Their rates are lower than those of an accountant. A lot of them work remotely as well, so you are not limited to the nearby area. A bookkeeper can help with such items:

 - Post transactions in accounting software.
 - Work on collections / post cash receipts.
 - Pay bills / post cash payments.
 - Run payroll (escpecially it you outsource payroll to ADP or similar).
 - File payroll reports with governmental entities.
 - Prepare reports for internal use.

An accountant, on the other hand, will handle a broader range of tasks for you:

 - All tasks that a bookkeeper can do.
 - Set up a chart of accountants (bookkeeper can do this as well, but
   it's a good idea to reconcile with the accountant who will prepare
   your taxes to ensure all information is captured in the most
   appropriate way).
 - Prepare quarterly, etc. tax returns.
 - Run payroll (especially if it's in-house).
 - Prepare budgets, budget to actual, etc.
 - Assist with financing decisions.
 - Perform tax planning and compliance.

If you decide to hire a bookkeeper, I strongly recommend engaging a (tax) accountant at the same time to do initial planning, etc. so that when the time comes to file your taxes, you have all information for the accountant. If you hire a good accountant, he or she should be able to handle all mentioned tasks.

They also work out your tax owed, run your payroll (even if its just for yourself) and advise you on whatever tax benefits/charges you may incur during the running of your business.
