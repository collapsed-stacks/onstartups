Should Indie Software Developers Form A Company (like an LLC) to protect themselves from potential lawsuits?  All of the recent news about patent trolls is making me think I should form an LLC before launching my project, but that's a lot of paperwork and also costs about $800 per year.

<p>Only form a company if you can maintain a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_veil" rel="nofollow">corporate veil</a>.  If your company doesn't act like a company, and you get sued, you run the risk of being personally liable, thus defeating the purpose of forming a corporation in the first place.</p>
