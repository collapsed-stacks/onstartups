Here's the case. I have great ideas about starting a social networking company, but I am not a programmer. So I need to find a technical co-founder first, I mean a really awesome ass-kicking programmer whom I believe is hard to find in my country which is China. 

Why overseas? The key is better education. They found their talent at a very early stage of their lives and practiced a lot, and go to the best colleges in the world, more creative and passionate. That's what I'm looking for!  

So if I had the chance I would love to invite one over to start a company with me. Whether he is still a student in college or currently working but seeking a chance to do something better.

It's never easy. Lots of challenges for both of us. But let me put it this way. I believe in fate. If fate is going to put us together to do something big, it will be done. I'll try my best with my best intention to offer my vision and the big picture ,if they are really interested, then we come upon a proper agreement, finally someone fly over. It's that simple. If it doesn't work, I'll try next one.

All I have to do is to find a great programmer who is willing to combine his excellent tech skills with my ideas together to create a solid foundation of our company, then moving forward to make our dreams come true.

This may sound idealistic. But I'm willing to put all my heart into it. We definitely have to go through hard work, lots of problems, even failures. But if we persist. I believe there's no problems that we can't really solve. Success will finally be on our side!

What do you guys think about it? If you got an invitation from a total stranger like me, what would you react? What could possibly make it acceptable for you to come over to work with me? Have you ever thought about working abroad?

Besides, if some of you are interested in coming to China. You can get my contact information in my profile or leave yours. And needless to say, China is now really a land of opportunities. It's the next big thing!

Sorry for writing so long. I just got little too excited about my plan, and I believe eventually I will find the right partner. Just wish me good luck!

YC,

Having dreams is great, but founding a startup is not dreamy, it is a lot of hard work.  For most startups, people put in an enormous amount of work and it ends in failure.  That isn't to say that you shouldn't try -- it is all about the journey after all -- but you need to go into it with more pragmatism.

This appears to be your rational for why someone should come to China to work with you:

> I believe in fate. If fate is going to put us together to do something big, it will be done.
>
> All I have to do is to find a great programmer who is willing to combine his excellent tech skills with my ideas together, moving forward to make our dreams come true.

That isn't much to go on.  Lot's of people have dreams.  If you want someone to uproot their life and travel to China at their own expense, you need to clearly explain why your dreams will succeed.

First of all let me tell you not to listen to anyone trying to scare you off.

It is true that a start-up is a lot of hard work. It is also true that wonders happen and people do succeed even if all odds are against them, often to their own surprise. Therefore go for it.

One option that is always open to you is to learn programming and try on your own. That is in fact the only way to implement the exactly same idea in your mind, without distortions through misinterpretation by a different person. Whether it will work for you can only be seen after you have tried it. So think about it.

Now, closer to your question. Would anyone from Western countries move to China to work on a start-up?

I normally hate it to discourage people but I feel like the answer is "unlikely".

The two main reasons why people move countries are:

1. Family reasons like marrying a girl from somewhere else

2. Career reasons. Here people usually expect to substantially increase their quality of life, meaning they move to a more developed country or agree to temporary stay in a less developed one for a very generous pay check.

The only option that applies to you is 2. But since you're not able to pay anything speaking less of generously people from Western countries won't move.

Understand that it is not that easy to move countries. There is a different mentality, way of life, climate, food and many other aspects that present themselves. It is very hard. It takes at least six months before you get established and feel okay enough to attempt to work. It's very important that you have somebody behind you to help you with the settlement, like a big company and helpful coworkers. Otherwise you're on your own.

More likely that someone from your region, perhaps from neighboring countries with a similar lifestyle would try it but other than that, well, it's not gonna work. Some crazy head or possibly a disgruntled guy who's been down for several years in a row would one day abandon it all and leave his Western country to change the scenery. The question is whether you want to have him.

Having said that, your options include:

1. Learn programming and try it yourself

2. Find a partner from your region

3. Cooperate remotely (very risky)

4. Cooperate half-remotely. Find a partner in a country where you can easily go for a short term and meet there regularly to discuss things. Also risky but at least you will keep a better contact.

5. Find a way to move to another country of your choice and work on a start up there (possibly only in your off hours)

Not much but don't give up. An opportunity will present itself.
