<p>I have a holding company which owns 100% of two LTD companies let's just call them A and B</p>

<p>If I was to be paid from a company say ABC for work carried out by my company A does my company A have to issue an invoice to company ABC or can the holding company do this ? </p>

<p>The issue I have is that I would need to setup 3 different bank accounts to be paid into and from which could be a bit of a hassle after a while.</p>

<p><strong>Normally it is the company performing the service that issues the invoice. (so company A in your case)</strong></p>

<p>The holding company's role is usually to consolidate the results of the companies A &amp; B, not to send invoices...</p>

<p><strong>Regarding the type of question you ask</strong> (and thus the level of your knowledge of accountancy), <strong>I must advice you to consult (and hire) an accountant</strong>. Because the things involving holdings etc. will become even much more complex than this one (e.g. tax declaration, intercompany cash flows, guarantees for bank loans...)</p>

<p>Another advantage of hiring/outsourcing an accountant is that he/she knows well all the local specificities that people in forums like this one doesn't always know. </p>
