I'm a 15 trying to start a small tech support service for family computers with my friend and I've started designing the business card. I've put my mobile number and feel its my obligation to tell customers I'm 15 but I'm picky about giving away personal details. Is it safe to put my age on the business card? Call me paranoid but I'm worried about advertising a business run by "Two 15 year old boys" because it could attract pedophiles. And yes, you may laugh but I don't think it would be funny if I got caught.

Technically, at 15 you can't start a "real" business. The reason is simple. Businesses revolve around contracts and, under common law, a contract with a minor is voidable and therefore is unenforcable. And then there all of the other challenges on top of that.

**However**, that doesn't mean you can't start a "kid" business. When I was twelve, I typed up a letter that introduced "Alex's Lawn Mowing Service" and I walked around the neighborhood and dropped it in everyone's mailbox. All of my neighbors knew it was pretty just some kid. But I made like $50 bux a week -- which was incredible back then and at my age.

When I was 15, I started a software company at sold shareware products that was distributed via BBS. I don't think many knew it was a "kid" business, but it didn't really matter because no one is going to sue over $15 that they mail to some PO Box. And if they do... then there would be no lawsuit, because any contract created ("I will give you working software for $15") is void.

My advice... get some businesses card, give them out to friends and family, and you'll get some hits and business. I'd leave off the "15 years" beacuse it doesn't really help sell and, besides, everyone will already know it. And if they don't, they'll figure it out pretty quickly. Also, make sure to charge way-below market rates (if GeekSquad is $100, charge $25 or $30).

I think worrying about getting kidnapped, etc, is pretty pointless. It could happen no matter what you do. Just use common sense and tell your parents where you're going to be. If you don't know the customer and he sounds off, then have them bring the computer over to your house instead.

Hopefully your "give the whole idea up" comment was a joke. I think you should definitely do it. If I were you I wouldn't (and probably legally couldn't) file for a real business (Corporation, LLC, etc) but there's no harm in having some fun and making some money with your friend starting a "business" like you describe. You can work for family and friends like you described which will lead to referrals to other people in the community and it should grow from there. I did something similar in college.

As for the age question, I've never seen a business card with an age on it, so I'd probably leave it off. Assuming you're working through referrals people will mention you're in high school. If you were to advertise anywhere you could always put it in the advertisement (maybe mention you're in high school as opposed to a specific age).

Have fun with it and when you get older you'll already have the experience to start a legal business. It takes years to learn and starting early will get you a jump start on everyone else.

In my opinion you shouldn't get too hung up with details at this stage. As you say you are 15 so you are not going to win any big contracts. My guess is that when you do get work it will come word of mouth. Just enjoy the experience, have fun, learn lots and keep doing what you are doing. You won't make millions out of this business, but you will learn some valuable experience which might pay off later in life.

Good luck and +1 for having the guts to do something for yourself at 15 and be bright enough to find this site and come on here and ask a question.

I have a 4" thick stack of business cards in my desk drawer. I look at them when I need to call someone, and don't look to them for much else.

Don't waste alot of time on the business card. Just buy nice paper so it doesn't feel cheap.

Just get some parental consent and you'll be fine. My brother started selling on eBay at around your age. And come to think of it, finding a way to streamline parental consent for minors who wish to do business is a big market in itself. Think big.

As for your original question, there's no need to put your age on business cards - nobody does that. Just leave it to a need-to-know basis.

Do you have a DECA club at your school? Try and get some advice there. You can't be the first 15 year old to ever do any business: mow lawns, shovel walks, or baby sit. You just need to be careful going into someone's home. You and your partner should go together to an unfamiliar home or business and let it be known that your visit is documented. The more you can do remotely the better.

You may have to establish the company in a parent's/adult's name to accept non cash payments. I don't know if you can get a business checking account and I'm pretty sure you're not going to get a merchant account to accept credit cards.
