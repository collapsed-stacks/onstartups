So I was wondering if anyone is involved in doing travel planner services.

I am thinking a place for individuals or groups to collect info, routes, prices etc. before they travel.

Anyone heard about something along those lines?

<p>Thomas - Kayak started a service called TRIPS <a href="http://www.kayak.com/trips/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kayak.com/trips/</a> in Beta.  This is probably close to what you are looking for.</p>

there are also travel 2.0 websites, which are based on user generated content, sites like tripadvisor, igougo and there are many others. There are sites with semantic search capabilities, for example a user can type that he wants an adventurous trip for a weekend for x budget from y location, and the smart search engine offers him relevant tour options searched from wide range of sources. I worked in Amadeus, where they are innovating this technology, trying to make it much more advanced then what is already available. I think Kango is one the companies in this space.

<p>It's not a travel planner service per se, but <a href="http://kayak.com" rel="nofollow">kayak</a> is a great price aggregation site.</p>
