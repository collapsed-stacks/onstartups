I have problem, I live in Poland and I want to incorporate my software startup that makes around $15k/year. The cost of incorporation of a limited company in Poland is $7k/year (w/out taxes). This is too much for my startup to not slow down this project growing speed but without incorporation I will be running the business illegally, which will be a barrier to developing the business.

Where I can incorporate? I know that foreign incorporation has additional costs if there's no presence in that country, but I think that can be cheaper than in Poland.

Can someone advise me something from personal experience based on concrete information about costs, country and experience (can be not from Poland)?

Try a british ltd. 

They are pretty inexpensive and as it's the EU there's not many problems for you to register one. Google should help.

I think that the easiest solution could be register Ltd. in UK. All formalities could be done via Internet from Poland. You can save much money on the accounting services (cheaper in the UK) and taxes.

Additional profit is possibility to join UK's insurance system.

<p>If you speak some German, I'd recommend looking into the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unternehmergesellschaft_%28haftungsbeschr%C3%A4nkt%29" rel="nofollow">Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschr√§nkt)</a> since you're very close by and can easily come over to do things like open a bank account in person. The tax scenario is very similar to the Ltd and it is also just a matter of a few hundred Euros to incorporate a UG.</p>
