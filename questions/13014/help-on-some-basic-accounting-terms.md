Main accounting record.  It holds the summary information on the main accounts and is used to build the different accounting statements.  I see it as the aggragation of entries by categories of activity.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_of_accounts">Chart of Accounts:</a>
This is the description of all the catagories that the accounting information will be organized in.  Each account is a category of accounting activity.  The chart of accounts is sort of a table of contents describing the categories that the business will be using and how it will be used.  


<a href="http://blog.accountingcoach.com/general-ledger-general-journal/">Journal: </a>
Journal is really a set of entries just describing the day to day activity.  In computer terms its like a log of business events that occured one after the other.  To close up the journal it feeds tinto the accounts (the aggregate categories of accounting).


<a href="http://www.accounting-and-bookkeeping-tips.com/learning-accounting/accounting-system-basics.htm"> Set of Books: </a>
Because accounting was originally done in books this use to describe the different books that house the different accounting enteries.  So there would be a book for the journal entries (Book of entries) and a book for the accounts and so on.  So this is just where all of the accouting entries are made.
