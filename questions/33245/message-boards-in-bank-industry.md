I am searching for places where bank owners discuss the industry challenges. Any suggestions for message boards or Q&A websites? I am currently mostly browsing linkedin discussions.

Thanks!

What country are you interested in? I doubt you will find much info here about message boards for banks in the Ukraine. Since banking laws are country specific, without a country it's not really possible to give any advice.

Finally, what maks you think bank owners discuss anything publicly?
