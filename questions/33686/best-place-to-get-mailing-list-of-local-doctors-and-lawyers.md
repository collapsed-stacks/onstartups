There is no free option. For paid options, there really is only one source: Standard Rate and Data Service (SRDS). One of the things that SRDS produces are lists of mailing lists that you can buy. To get access to the SRDS lists there are two options:

 1. Pay $788 and access it online: http://next.srds.com/for-agencies (click Direct Marketing)
 2. Go to your local library and take a look at the hard copy. Most decent sized libraries receive the printed version.
