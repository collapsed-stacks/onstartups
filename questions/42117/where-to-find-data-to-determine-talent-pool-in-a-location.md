Good evening

I'm part of a startup thats looking to move to an area with a decent talent pool of IT professionals, and after surfing the morass that is Stats Canada, I wonder if anyone would know where we could find data that shows any information that could help us with our research, specifically unemployment in the IT industry broken by CMA and/or province would be exactly what we need.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Yes it's easy to answer "Just move to Toronto", but a through research would go over better with the powers that be, especially since they rather not move there.

Just as a general point - what kind of people are you trying to hire?

Because, in my experience, even in a down-economy and a high-unemployment environment the best developers are still employed. Because, well, they're the best developers :-)

What moving to a high unemployment area will get you is larger numbers of desperate applicants. That will make your job harder not easier...

(There are other good reasons to have businesses in high unemployment areas. Rents are often cheaper. There are often grants, etc. But recruiting becomes harder - not easier.)
