_[Multi-part question with similar introduction because I thought the questions would be more useful separately.]_

Hi all,

I'm currently a one-man dev team with what I believe is a killer idea. I've got a varied set of skills, but I know that I'm going to need some superhero developers to make my project happen. The issue I've had here is that, like many other developers, I work a pretty demanding day-job. Outside of work (which I don't think would appreciate me recruiting for a side project), I don't know quite how to get people interested or involved in my project. I'm fairly young, and don't necessarily have a network of developer contacts.

__How do I build a team whose skills and involvement I can trust?__

I'm generally a pretty trusting person, but I'm wondering how I can take people I have no experience with and gauge them enough to know whether they would make a  good addition to the team. 

What is the best way to build / gauge a relationship from scratch with the purpose of building a great project team?



Thanks in advance for any help you can give!

**A-Teams** are very rare in software development.

They have few things in common:

- They are usually built by themselves
- It takes years and many turnover to get to the a-team stage
- It is always cross functional
- The more you want it, the less likely you'll get it

You may want to try to post that question on http://programmers.stackexchange.com/. You'll certainly get more interesting answers than mine.

<p>A-team, B-team, etc. is all BS MBA-types like to use, since it is very cosy to use terminology than actually build a great team.</p>

<p>That said, Pierre nailed it, except one point - it does not take years, but it does take some turn-over. There will be some turds along the way, sweep them out ASAP. </p>

<p>Also, you should look way outside your comfort zone, when it comes to diversity of your team. E.g. in tech companies, stay away from stuffing your company with white and asian single males in 20-30 year-old group or you will end up with the worst case of groupthink.

**Hire self-starters**: people who are disciplined, able and eager to learn on their own, who can take responsibility, and aren't afraid to make and learn from their mistakes. More and more, I'm becoming convinced that mindset and personality are at least as important as technical skills. Anyone can learn technical skills, but it's far harder to gain *discipline*, *motivation*, and *leadership* where there has been none previously.

Does that mean don't hire people with good technical skills? Not at all, but you should be open to hiring a less qualified candidate with the right mindset over a more qualified candidate that isn't flexible and will never grow beyond who they are right now. You want people who can manage themselves, not people who are constantly dependent on you for the next step.

The other part of the equation is that you need to allow your team room to grow and learn. Equip them to succeed by removing obstacles. Allow them to take on responsibilities and let them succeed and fail and learn from both. Encourage critical thinking skills. Let them in on the business side of things so that they can understand the whole picture. **If your employees are developing your products, you should be developing your employees.**

A star team is much better than a team of stars. Applies anywhere, not just in software. Get some reliable people to start with, and build from there.

**Open source contributions & real-world portfolios**

Hire people who have a history of commits to open source because:

 - People who contribute to open source are passionate about software
 - People who contribute are self motivated
 - You can track project commitment and long term involvement by looking at someones commits

Hire people who have real world portfolios because it shows they want to be recognized for their work and that they can actually produce products that people use.
