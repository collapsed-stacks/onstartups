<p>My friend and I are working on a product - "Data centric configuration" approach to build business applications. The product is ready and we have a pilot customer as well. </p>

<p>From our analysis we feel this has a niche market that is not necessarily big, but that addresses some key issues. And we feel our product is unique, powerful and easy to use. </p>

<p>How can I get candid and unbiased feedback on the product? I have shown it to the people in my circles and they have given me positive reviews. But I want to get this reviewed by a larger audience who has absolutely no connection with me and the product we developed. </p>

<p>Just like how this site says "Beta" (although no product should be in beta for so long), you could launch your product in Beta for 'free' for a limited time.</p>

<p>I've seen this strategy being used plenty of times before, where you are given full-free access to an application for a limited amount of time until the app hits 1.0 , then you roll out your pricing. You must clearly specify this though, as you don't want clients getting a 'shock' when the pricing comes out.</p>

<p>As per finding customers, ideally you or your friend need to assume a primary role of salesman now. You can continue doing development, but at least one of you needs to focus on sales/marketing.</p>

<p>If neither of you are good at sales (which can happen, although I feel that at least one of the founders should train himself to be a top salesman) then you can bring in a sales/marketing guy.</p>

<p>The only problem is that anybody working in sales is not going to do it for free, unless your customer market is 40-50 million willing customers, then you can try alternative sales strategies.</p>

<p>My advice to you for now is to look at your current client as a gateway to more clients. Speak to them about approaching any customers they have that could use your app. Of course I don't know what the app is, otherwise it could be easier to identify different sales strategies.</p>

<p>Another piece of advice is to start reading up about marketing and sales. Although the internet is awash with some very good resources, a lot of it is washed up jargon that means nothing. Look at timeless books that teach you how to be a salesman. These books are normally not marketed as sales book but have been distinguished as such by successful people.</p>

<p>Remember, just because your app is online, doesn't mean you need to market online only. You could make cold calls too. Attend conferences/expos, etc.</p>

<p>The short answer is <strong>through surveys</strong>. </p>

<p>I see these 2 main routes:
<strong>1. Survey site visitors/users.</strong>
If your site is new, just buy traffic from Google AdWords (most recommended, even $5/day could be enough with display text ads). You have 2 approaches:
a) Collect email addresses (through free registration or newsletter modules) and then email a survey link to users.
b) Embed widgets like 1-question polls or feedback overlays into the site. There are dozens of sites that offer these type of widgets with a simple script add-on to the site, no coding needed. Try <a href="https://webengage.com" rel="nofollow">WebEngage</a> - I haven't used them yet, but I see their widgets on Moz.com which is a good enough reason.</p>

<p><strong>2. Pay people to evaluate your site/product.</strong> 
Without knowing about your site, consider these:
a) UserTesting.com - very affordable, allows to pre-qualify testers with a question, and it makes you think through what questions you want answered
b) maven.co - can be useful if you need an expert opinion for highly specialized markets</p>

<p>I personally would suggest #1 option, unless you are looking for very detailed feedback on UI, rather than confirmation on big/strategic questions about the product (pricing, features, etc). I had VERY good experience with UserTesting.com - got great feedback on some UI confusion I needed to confirm.</p>
