Our start-up is not yet launched but has been proposed to make a co-branded website with a big player on the market, where both parties would be presented equally through a number of ads and links to commercial products and services. Our products and services are really complementary and the opportunity to work with this partner could really boost our company both commercially and in terms of brand recognition.

Does any one have experience from co-branded websites? what are the pros and cons?

So the co-branded website is not a marketing website for your business.

It's just some website.. like a blog, or a large content publishing website or forum or something? And the question is that both businesses would work on it and both would advertise on it? Complementary products/offerings and the site I assume would pull in your target audience?

Assuming you can get along with that other business and the cost to create the website can be justified - I can't really see any downsides to this. Maybe just make an agreement if certain things are not fulfilled then no advertising for that biz.
