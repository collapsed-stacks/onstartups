I believe that Apple deliberately holds back this information. The reason for this is that if such information got out, developers would see that even the top selling apps are hardly worth the effort. I read a news article in Norwegian at digi.no writing about this. They had interviewed some authors of top selling apps.

There is no public access to this information. Your only choice is to contact the developers directly and ask for this information.

You can estimate popularity using the number of reviews the application has received in the AppStore, but this is in no way directly tied to sales. You can only get at most, the least amount of sales the application has had, as you can't review without buying it.
