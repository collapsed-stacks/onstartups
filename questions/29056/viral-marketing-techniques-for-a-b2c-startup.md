I'm looking for some viral marketing techniques for a startup in B2C space. Please help share some ideas. If you have some personal experience then share what worked and what did not?

Thanks,

In my experience, almost everyone who starts out with the goal of "going viral" fails.  Why?  Because they start trying all kinds of tricks and schemes that seem disingenuous, and users always sniff it out.  Here's a much better question to ask: **What content can I share that my customers would find remarkable?**
