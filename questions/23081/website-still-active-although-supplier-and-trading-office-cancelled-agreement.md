How can one legally make a company remove the website due to false representation.  The domain belongs to the trading company as well as the company name.  But the supplier has terminated the distribution agreement almost a year ago and the trading company is still showing the suppliers products and logo on the website.   This is very frustrating for the supplier and the new trading company he has appointed to do his sales& marketing plus distribution.  products.  Customers are confused and makes it quite annoying having to explain that they are no longer their reps.

First-- assuming it hasn't been done -- pick up the phone and ask to speak to the webmaster about a copyright violation on their website you would like to resolve. 

If they are in the same location as you, go walk over to them and walk in and ask to meet with someone in charge and say that you are there to solve a problem without getting lawyers involved. All you want is your copyright material removed from their website. 

Assuming you have done that and it doesn't work:

Send a letter (on a lawyers letterhead if you can) that assumes that it is a simple oversight. Provide a specific URL of each place that the logo and name are mentioned with explicit request to have it removed.

If it isn't. Send a cease-and-desist letter (once again on a lawyers letterhead if you can, but it doesn't need to be). There are lots of templates on the web you can customize for this.

If this doesn't work  then you send notice of intent to file a copyright infringement suite with some high punitive damage claim -- like $6 million.

If that doesn't work -- file the copyright infringement suit.




Here is the cease and desist letter I often use:
