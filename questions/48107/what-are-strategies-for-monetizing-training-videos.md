I created some very useful training videos in Spanish (latam), and I want to monetize them. They are focused on students and professionals. How can I monetize them? Some ideas I've come up with are: 

- An IOS app.
- Using a platform that allows me to do it via revenue share.

What would be a good strategy?

You can create an iOS and Android application wherein you embed the videos you've created.

The drawback is that the download size from iTunes/Playstore will be very big.

However, you could also provide an option to download the videos through the app you'll create. True, it will be internet costly, but that's just to mention another way to do it.

Apart from that, you can also sell them as DVDs.

Monetizing will be difficult once someone decides to hack away at your means of selling the videos and then post a torrent online. -- that is to say, I don't mean to bring the mood down, but i just want to help you become aware.

You can also try to earn from these by putting up your own site where you 'stream' the content to paid subscribers, like what Yahoo! normally does. It is not hard to download YouTube videos, since they are stored, but if you stream, it will at least be tougher.

Good luck!
