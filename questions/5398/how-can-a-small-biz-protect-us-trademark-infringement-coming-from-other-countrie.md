## How can a small biz protect US trademark infringement coming from other countries?

My US-based online media service has picked up a clone - a site based in a European country that nearly mirrors our name. According to a trademark lawyer it's pretty clear that they are violating our common law trademark that we've established over the past two years, and that they should not use this name, at least when soliciting customers in the US.  

But we're struggling with the decision of whether to take any action.  Currently we're addressing this on a customer-by-customer basis.  When our customers are solicited by this other group, and ask us what is going on, we explain politely that we are not associated with them, don't know their motivations, etc. That seems to satisfy our customers for now and we don't think many of them have done any business with the other company.  

The process of taking legal action against a European-based company to stop them from infringing on a trademark in the US could take years, cost many thousands of dollars, and would have no guarantee of working when it finally makes its way through the other country's courts.  And there would be a significant drain of time and energy from our small business in pursuing such action. So we don't see that as a good alternative.  

Another option is to simply try to scare them with some kind of cease and desist letter from our lawyer that insists that they change their name if they're going to continue going after the same market. Of course, a quick conversation with their own trademark lawyer would educate them that we'd face a long and expensive road. And we're nervous about un-foreseen repercussions of such a letter.  They could turn it around on us, try to create some kind of public spat that we don't want to get into.  It could encourage them that we're scared of their competition and they should pursue this line of business more vigorously (so far we have been unscathed because we have a better quality product).  And when they see in 6 months that no legal action is actually coming behind the letter, it will give them more encouragement still.  

We're looking for other ideas and perspectives on handling this type of situation.  Do international trademark disputes like this ever make sense, especially among very small businesses?  Are there other options to explore than the ones I've mentioned?

The best answer is to talk to your lawyer about the best strategy. They can advise based on your current finances, your future opportunities, the value of your trademaks etc.

From experience, though, here are some thoughts:

 - A cease and desist letter will likely be ignored. They have no teeth, if you were serious you'd just go straight to the courts
 - Try to avoid taking it public, as it won't help you to get into an argument on public forums
 - If they are deliberately copying you, they probably see this as a "get to success quickly" scheme, and aren't prepared for the time and effort you've spent. They will likely drop off the map within the year (I've seen this happen to Open Source projects and Startups I've been involved in several times)
 - Focus on your business, not on others. If you're a startup, your energy is likely better spent innovating and improving - then they need to waste their time trying to copy you. They'll always be behind, and they won't know what's under the hood (so your product will always be better)

If you don't have the money to pursue them, then focus on your own business, keep an eye on them passively, and beat them where it counts: with the customers.

Good luck!

It's bad that they're showing up on your customers' radar.  If they were small enough to not be found, it wouldn't matter.

It comes down to: Is it worth the money to you?  Sounds like right now it isn't.

You might wait to see what effect they have on your business.  If it's just noise-level, and/or if they disappear as Joseph says, you will have been wise to wait.  If it starts impacting your bottom line, *make careful record of this* because that's going to be important in court.   Once the impact is enough to warrant spending money to stop it, spend the money.

Note that winning in court has two parts: One is causing them to stop, the other is damages.  You'll need that bottom-line proof for the latter.

This is a tricky one since US Trademark law can't help you much in Europe. It's good that you have a superior product. That will win out in the end. 

A lengthly court battle will just drain your resources and frustrate you. In my opinion, not worth it. In the end, Jason nailed it when he said "Is it worth the money to you?". That is really what it comes down to.

I would suggest that you do minimal things that show that they are in the wrong. Send a letter, file a grievance or whatever. You do need to protect your turf from people like this. If you don't, others may come along as well.

Is there any chance that they mirror more than your name?  Can you find any content that they have copied from your website?  If you can find any direct copying you can send them a DMCA Takedown Notice (and send it to their ISP also) which will likely be more effective than a letter regarding their similar name.

If their Domain Name is confusingly similar, you could also try to pursue action through ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. They have a process for working these disputes. The entire process is lengthy, of course -- but similar to how a DMCA takedown notice works, just the *threat* of an ICANN dispute resolution notification could be very effective against them.


http://www.icann.org/en/udrp/ has the information on ICANN's Domain Name dispute resolution process. 

Good luck!
