When starting a On line Retail store that uses drop-shipping services, will I still need to choose a market segment? Or can I just market and sell to anyone all over the world.

I mean the drop-shippers will do all the packaging etc all I do Is market and hope for sales right?

You can sell to anyone all over the world if you want to ... but since you are starting i would suggest you to start in your own country, it will allow you to test all processes, order processing, how drop-shippers work, etc.. and once you are OK with everything start selling to the rest of the world.

I know as someone new to business it can sound counter intuitive, why would you want to sell to *less* people? But this simple answer is:

Yes, no matter what business you're in, you need a market segment. 
Defining your market helps you focus your business, and tells you who you need to be as a company. If you're trying to market to everyone, your company ends up looking like it has multiple personality disorders, and for both investors, and customers, this is a red flag. 

Having a well defined market segment helps you be efficient, consistent, and will help save you a lot of headaches in the future, the worse thing you can do is set out in your business with too broad a market, and have to start from scratch again later on.

If you're going to do marketing, you need to decide who to target, because you're not going to be able to target everyone everywhere (unless you have infinite resources). 

So yes, you need to segment your market: Find those who are easier for you to reach and for whom your services would be the most valuable, and target them. Later you can expand, if you're successful at the start.
