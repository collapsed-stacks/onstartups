Andrew Warner did an interview with the founder of buysellads.com.  You have to pay to listen to it, but the following url, http://mixergy.com/buysellads-todd-garland-interview/ , has the full transcript which you can read.  The interview was pretty good and you can learn a lot about the thinking that is behind it.
