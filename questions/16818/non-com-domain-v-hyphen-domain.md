I am currently working on a web application and have started looking at the available domain names for my application.  I have done some searching on answers.onstartups about hyphen domain names and non .com domain names and am still not sure what the best thing to do is.  The name that I want to register is taken only under the .com and the hyphen name is available.  Based on the whois register of the domain name I'm looking for it is registered by a company that does domain registration and doesn't expire for another 2 years.  I am just wondering what everyone thinks the best way to go is.  I'm not really keen on trying to purchase this domain name but am not sure what the best solution is.  I was thinking of either registering a .net, .co, etc or the hyphen name.  What do you think the best solution is?

<p>Find another .com domain without a hyphen.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you'll always have to "explain" your domain to people when you tell them.  You always have to say <em>"Remember, it's .BIZ not .COM"</em> or <em>"... and that's with a hyphen between WORD1 and WORD2"</em>  Even after explaining it, you risk customers not finding your domain.</p>

<p>A couple resources to help you find an available name:

<p>For every times this happens: don't find another domain name, find another name.</p>
