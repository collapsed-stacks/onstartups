I am about to take a trip across country.  I am taking my motorcycle as it is 1/2 the cost of my 4x4 SUV.  I will be going about 8,000 miles roundtrip.  I would like to look at the locations that my father, mother, and brother live to see if the employment is better since living with one of them would make a transition like this easier.  I am a freelance drafter and would like to either pick up more clients or see if the job market in their locations needs my services.  I will also be working on existing client's projects during the trip on my laptop.  The trip will be about 4 weeks long.

My question is - what can I write off for my business?  I have had a home office for years and my business has been part time until I was laid off a year ago.  Now I'm barely getting business and am looking for other work or even locations.

I think yes. Keep proper notes of meetings with clients. There is nothihng against an extensive business trip and if you manage to land a client the cost is justified anyway. It may look grey area, but at the end of the day... this is one of the priviledges of a freelancer.

A tax accountant/lawyer may be able to help you with 'writing off'. But there is a lot of benefit to what you are about to do.

I am replying to this out of my own experience. I would say, go ahead. I believe in travel. It clears your mind and offers you a good perspective. Meet a lot of different people, jot down ideas, and chalk your plans. I recommend keeping a diary or an online journal for this purpose.

Travel without any expectations. Keep an open mind and I am sure you will have a better business plan before the end of your travel. Good luck!
