My technology is at the early adopter phase of the market and most players have horizontal focuses into many verticals. Occasionally you see one competitor that has taken a vertifcal focus into one industry mainly becuase they have a large client base in that space.

Some advice I received says take  a vertical approach when you start based on my experience in one particular industry. The challenge is I don't have experience in one particular industry execpt government which takes too long to close deals.

Any advice on where to start with an industry focus?

Here's some ideas:

 - Make a list of what other industries
   you know or have contacts in.
   
   Evaluate their size and if they are
   growing
   
   Talk to some people working in the
   industry or for an industry
   association about what you are
   offering and whether they think it
   would be of interest
   
   Have a go and test your product in
   the market.

Good luck

Susan
