Iâ€™m trying to look for reasonable multipliers in Europe and in US
for the possible exit of the 1st VC at Yr5 in the NanoTech domain.

The start-up figures are as follows:

- 1st round VC: 2M at Yr1 (30% equity)
- 2nd round VC: 2M at Yr2 (20% equity)
- Income before tax: 11M at Yr5
- Retained earnings: 5 M at Yr5

Any idea? Or website were I could find some hints?

Criteria I have seen is 10x in 3-5 years or > 20% IIR for the investment duration.

There is not much out there in terms of guidance on this -- at least for free (I am sure that the http://www.thefunded.com/ has insights but you have to pay for that).

Once resource that someone referred to me is from Orrick (http://www.orrick.com/practices/corporate/emergingCompanies/startup/index.asp). The have a term sheet calculator that might help.

Still another would be The Money Tree (https://www.pwcmoneytree.com/MTPublic/ns/index.jsp) This tracks all the funding done by VC's and if you did some digging, you could probably figure out what exits were successful.

Standard multipliers that VCs look for in the US is somewhere between 5-10x of original investment.  Anything less, they usually consider "failure".

17x and above is great

around 10x is okay

under 5x is a failure.

this is why VCs only invest in companies that can create hundreds of millions of dollars of value: make no mistake how hard it is to get a good x exit.

<p>You could always look at get a list of 2008 - 2009 IPO's and look at their S-1's to back into the actual multiplier the VC's realized.  </p>

<p>2009 we had  LogMeIn, Rosetta Stone Inc., Open Table, DigitalGlobal Inc., Bridgepoint Education Inc., Ancestry.com, A123 Systems and a few others.  Check here for a list of 2009 IPO's <a href="http://www.iposcoop.com/index.php?option=com%5Fcontent&amp;task=view&amp;id=1545&amp;Itemid=148" rel="nofollow">iposcoop.com</a>.  </p>

VCs always say a 10x return is the goal, but I was once told by a small, but successful, VC (outside Silicon Valley) that "on average" the returns are less than 5x...that's just reality.

Silicon Valley has its own set of rules, which I cannot speak to.

Of course NanoTech will have its own set of rules, risks and rewards...you should probably ask people with specific experience in that space...
