I'm developing some school communication/information software for mobile and browser and I have a question about ads. I was going to have a resources section where people can post useful links and resources(you'd never have guessed), and I was thinking about putting ads in there. 

However, we're developing it as a quality, premium product so I'm wondering; would ads ruin that experience or could they be effectively integrated(and how?)?

Jason, ads in the resources part of your app can actually be useful if they're closely related to the kinds of products/services that might typically feature in that resources section. If they blend in with the look and feel of the page then I believe they could work well. 

Ads aren't in themselves a bad thing; it's relevancy and the degree to which they get in the way of what the user is trying to do that determines whether they're useful or irritating.

Is the user paying to access the software? From your post you mention "premium product" which sounds like it will be paid for?

If so then I feel ads are not something you should consider unless they are VERY relevant and useful and, even then, they should be very subtle and not impact the user experience at all.

Ads are acceptable if that is your way of funding a free offering - Facebook is a good example of this. Would I put up the suggested ads and so on on for Facebook if I was paying them? No chance but I tolerate them as I am getting something for nothing.
