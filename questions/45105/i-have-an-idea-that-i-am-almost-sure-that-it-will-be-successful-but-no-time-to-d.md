I live in Athens, Greece. I have an idea that is really simple to do. It just needs a blog, a twitter account and a facebook page for support.

The problem is that i don't have the time to work for it, after the creation of these 3 simple things (blog, twitter, fb page). I am involved in various other things with my partner.

I do not want all of the possible future profit for my own. I only need 3-4 devoted persons that will do the work needed. And I could possibly have a small percent of the future profits (if any!)

The problem is how to be safe that if I tell some people my idea, they won't do it themselves since it's simple to do and run as I explained.

Does anyone have any ideas that would help?? Thanks for your time reading this!

The truth is that most ideas are worthless and not unique. It is the execution that adds value.

Having said that, it may be that you can find the time to test out your idea in a small but meaningful way. If it looks like it is following your expectations, you can pursue it. You can hire people to help you, just as any other business does.

Think about your typical week, can you spare 30 minutes per day? If so, you can make progress.

Something doesn't match here.

> I have an idea that I am almost sure that it will be successful

and...

> .. that is really simple to do. It just needs a blog, a twitter account and a facebook page for support...

yet...

> I can spare 30 minutes per day but the problem is that the time needed
> to be done properly is much more, that's why a team of 3-4 people is
> needed.

**Does not compute.**

You have a conceptual, untested idea that theoretically can be successful  that seems content heavy (simple blog / twitter / facebook) YET requires a team of 3-4 people to implement - and you cannot dedicate time to prove it out? 

Something simple shouldn't require a team of 3-4 people.  And if it was, then one should be able to break down the effort into outsourceable chunks to get it done efficiently.

Either support the effort with (1) cash to outsource work or (2) time to validate the model.

"A good idea is worthless without impeccable execution and a commitment to iterate."

"It’s not about ideas. It’s about making ideas happen."
- Scott Belsky

"Tell anyone and everyone your idea without fear they’re going to steal it."

"Successful entrepreneurs are quick movers because they realize that just having a multi-billion dollar idea doesn’t mean anything unless they get it out there before someone else does."
- Kevin O’Connor

I could give you a bunch more quotes, but I think you get the point. Get working on your idea or even hire people to do it for you! If it's a great idea, you should be willing to invest adequate time in it.

To grow your business you will have to give time to it along with a good plan. If you are confident that your plan is good enough, you must invest more time in it.
If you can't give much time, then the only thing you can do is to plan it wisely and distribute the work wisely to the people with you. If you are giving 30 minutes to your work then you must make sure that its utilized at its best. And if you can't give time, you will have to trust someone to execute your plan.
