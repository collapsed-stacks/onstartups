I am about to acquire a US online dropshipping business. 
Most orders require the clients to fill out a detailed contact form and then a sales person calls them back to close the configuration and finalize the sale. (Items go between 1000$-30000$ each, avg. of 150 leads per month).

I would like to have this part of the business outsourced to a call center operator- Does anyone have any insight on this issue? 
 -Recommendation for a certain call center? 
 -How much should I expect to pay them? 

Thank you!

Here are several tools that you can use to implement your own telemarketing campaigns, Saledialer.com; a virtual call center platform with predictive dialing, Highrise.com; a CRM that you can use to track all your leads and tasks so that your team can move the leads down the pipeline. And Toutapp.com for sending out emails to the leads that you can track whether or not they read your emails or clicked specific links within them.
