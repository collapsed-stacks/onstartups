I currently user odesk.com for some SEO, design and data entry work, but I find generally the quality of people to be not that great. Only about 30% of my jobs get done properly and I'm finding am spending quite a bit too much time on overhead on there.

Does anybody use similar sites that they find useful ? (Please don't recommend freelancer.com - probably the worst such site out there)
