I came up with an idea for a business web application and teamed up with a coder to build it. He has a lot of strong points and built a good product (it's 90% done) but to cut a long story short, of late his commitment has been waning. I'd like to continue being part of the business and grow, but I can't work with him anymore and need to find someone else to continue building it. I know nothing about coding, hosting, etc. What technical information do I need to obtain from him before we part ways? For example, the code, hosting details, etc. I'm afraid he will not co-operate once we go our own separate ways, so I need to be absolutely sure I have all of the information/details about the technical side of things before we split. Please help.

Quite often, people are very understanding about such things.  If you notice that his commitment is considerably less than before, he probably knows that more than you do.

I would first just talk to him about it and ask him whether he would like to carry on.  He might actually appreciate having a way out and you might come to some nice arrangement where you take over the idea and he is left with some fair amount of equity.  

It might be a good way to handle things elegantly, cordially, and professionally, without involving lawyers or any such things.

Would that attempt work in your case?

A cautionary note: unless you've agreed otherwise, this isn't your individual project, it's your joint project - and on assumption he has the greater claim to the code. If you go your separate ways, and you want to end up as the sole and undisputed owner of the code and running service, you need to come to an agreement. 

This has to be something you discuss together. Chances are, if his interest has waned, he'll be happy to come to some kind of arrangement. And he's probably the best person to help you find and get started with a new developer partner.

Start with the separation agreement, whether informal or legal (and I think this is exactly the kind of case where you need a lawyer to draft something that captures your intentions). Then work out the separation process. Technical handover is just one part of this bigger picture.

Firing him could lead to many problems.  He could

 - simply not cooperate and put you in a difficult position
 - sue you for wrongful termination
 - access the code through a back door and delete everything

Further, I think you underestimate the transition difficulty in hiring a new coder to come in and finish someone else's code.  Working on someone else's code without any help from that person can be very difficult.

I'd suggest that you try to work things out with him and fix the relationship if you can.  Have you talked with him about it at all?  Something like, "You seem to be unhappy with the work here, can we talk about it?"  Only after making significant efforts to improve the situation would I consider terminating him.

I suggest you have all the passwords for  logins, social media accounts, code repository (incase of a live site) as in some worst cases programmers change everything and claim it as their own and  the vision as their's or ask you to split the company.
Its better to be prepared than be sorry.
If the non performing person owns some vested equity then you are fine and you can fire with or without notice.. i.e if you choose to.
