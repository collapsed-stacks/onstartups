Okay, so my reason for wanting to become a consultant is so it's easier for communication between my clients and future clients. Right now, I've sold myself as a 3 employee start up company, but really there is only me... so I really hate beating around the bush saying "we" when there's only me.

Currently my company is a sole proprietorship... which legal structure is suitable for consulting?

What other legal/administrative prerequisites do I need to complete to be a consultant?

I've dealt with open source technology and rarely with proprietary platforms. I am interested in building enterprise software for an low saturated niche market so what is the best way to learn Java EE?

If you offer open source consulting... should you ever offer proprietary alternatives? Or is this just stupid?

What would my current clients feel if I told them MyCompany.com is now a consulting service, and I'd like to do case studies on them?

Is it normal for consultants to develop software? 

How would you approach companies, or would you need a large pocket for advertising?

You need to get back to honesty.

Stop saying you're 3 when you're 1.  What's the goal of saying 3?  To get a job that takes three people?  Oops, you can't do that job.

How about being yourself, so that when you find someone who wants you, you deliver perfectly?

Instead of deciding what you *think* others want and pretending, just be yourself and find those who want that.

gagaga, the pre-requisite for becoming a consultant is **deep knowledge about a specific problem domain**. In addition, you should preferably already be recognized as an expert by others -- through past jobs, writing, speaking engagements etc.

So what is required is the deep knowledge, and a legal structure to send invoices from. Any legal structure will per se suffice -- but you might want a company type that is itself a legal persona, i.e. you might want to be sure that any legal claims are against a *company you own*, and not against you. In addition, you might want to consider an insurance with professional liability coverage.

These are common considerations, which any business lawyer in your jurisdiction can quickly and inexpensively help you with.
