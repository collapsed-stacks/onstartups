Peter,
My advice, after all legal fees and USCIS hell you are better off either outsourcing or hiring a non-visa candidate. H1b in post 9/11 era is a big boys game. It requires so much documentation and so much compliance work. And considering you are legally required to pay prevailing wage, why would you pay extra costs of H1B?
