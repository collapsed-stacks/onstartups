I got into some legal trouble and am setting up a donation page to fund a defense fund.

Are PayPal donations Tax Deductible, So that I don't have to pay taxes on the donations?

You're confusing a lot of things:

 1. Only donations to registered 501(c)(3) nonprofits are tax-deductible. You're not a registered nonprofit with the IRS, so they're not deductible.

 2. It's the donor that deducts those donations from their taxes. You're the recipient.

You have to pay taxes on any income (meaning incoming money).  The only way around paying taxes is if you can get Non-Profit status from the IRS.  

So, say you have a web site and you make background images.  You can share these images for free, and ask for "donations".  These donations are INCOME.  dont let the term donation and donation to a non profit confuse you.

[Frank's answer](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/19731/paypal-donations-tax-deductibility/19738#19738) is not correct: true donations are not income.

When something (money or property) is given to an individual with no consideration, it is considered to be a gift. While there is a gift tax, it is a liability of the donor and not the recipient. And since the gift tax only kicks in at $13K/recipient/year**, it likely wouldn't even apply.

Just keep in mind the "no consideration" part. If you give anything of value in exchange for a donation, it becomes a purchase... which is subject to income tax.

** Some gifts don't trigger the gift tax (spousal gifts, paying for tuition, etc), and some gifts are tax deductable (gifts to non-profits).
