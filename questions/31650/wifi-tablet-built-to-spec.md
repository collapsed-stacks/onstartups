I have seen a lot of information on the internet about low-cost wifi tablets from India.  I have spoken to a reputable tech company in the states about ordering them and they quoted a price of $37 ea when bought in bulk.  They did not mention who the company was they were purchasing from.  For my business I am looking for a small, 4"x4" wifi tablet that needs to be able to log in to an admin website and perform a very simple function.  Any ideas as how to get a product like this?

Thanks

<p>First thing the name of Tablet is Aakash.
It's suppose to be an Android 2.2 tablet with 7" screen. 
(for more spec please visit : <a href="http://www.ubislate.com/specifications.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubislate.com/specifications.html</a>)</p>

<p>Manufacturer of this tablet is Datawind (web site: <a href="http://datawind.com/" rel="nofollow">http://datawind.com/</a>)</p>

<p>It will cost 35$ - 40$ (only for Indian students, as far as the web site and other news sources mentions) 
and around 60$ - 70$ for normal purchases.</p>

<p>BDW before placing a bulk order (for which direct dell with manufacturer is best), you should first order a peace and test it's performance for your self, as it's relatively recent release won't provide sound user reviews.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aakash_%28tablet%29" rel="nofollow">AAakash</a> tablet is what you are referring to.  Runs Android, should support basic mobile browsing for your clients just fine.  Looks like the price would be between $35 - $60. But, this page has a link to the manufacturer etc.</p>
