Im trying to find a place (either online or somewhere else) where I can hire an electrical engineer for a small contract job. I don't want to go post a "job" on craigslist or anywhere else, simply because it is such a small job and I don't want to waste anyone's true job search efforts.

The question remains though, how do I find an electrical engineer that can handle the job?

Any suggestions?

I'm going to assume here you want to design a circuit using bluetooth (as opposed to designing bluetooth chipsets since those already exist) then there are a couple of group on LinkedIn that might be a good place to post because they are full of engineers doing wireless stuff.  I'd start with:

 - Microwave Journal's "RF and Microwave Community"
 - WCA's "Wireless Communications Alliance"

also:

 - AWR's "AWR Consulants"

Disclaimer: I work for AWR.  I have no affiliations to the two other groups those
