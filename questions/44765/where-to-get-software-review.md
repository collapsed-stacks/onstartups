I'm trying to push my friend's software to Wikipedia, to do this I need real software reviews, but that seems impossible to get it, I've written emails (with our software free licenses for them, we even wanted to pay for the reviews) to PCMagazine, Softpedia, PC World and several other software related sites and their editors, 3 weeks passed, 3 more times I've tried to get an answer from them - 0 responds...

I would be thankful for any advice that could help me to overcome this problem.

Thank You

<p><strong>"Real Software reviews"</strong>... a bit confusing term.</p>

<p>Are you talking about feedback vs marketing?</p>

<p>Depending on your product, firms exist that can do a comparative review of your product.  Or you can contact a reviewer directly and ask them to do a private review of your product.  A bit of google article review will bring up some good people - then find them on linkedin.  </p>

<p>IF you want to get direct feedback to improve your product, <a href="http://usertesting.com" rel="nofollow">usertesting.com</a> and <a href="http://utest.com" rel="nofollow">utest.com</a> are services to consider as well. </p>

<p>As for getting a review published, that's a factor of understanding what your product is, creating enough interest in your company (and product) - a hook, per se - to make the editor interested enough, and presenting enough information to get your product reviewed as a "first look" or included in a piece already on the editorial calendar (<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,2806,2337140,00.asp" rel="nofollow">example calendar</a>) </p>

<p>Aside: I would never consider a "paid for review" equal to a "real review" - its at best a sponsored study, and at worst advertising. </p>

Depending on the software you can submit for downloading and easily get reviews and rewards.  Example download.com, tucows.com etc..
