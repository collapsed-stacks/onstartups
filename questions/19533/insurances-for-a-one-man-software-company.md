I'm a one man UK based startup with a number of products (both web based services and products that can be downloaded). My startup is a limited company and I have PI, employers, and public liability insurance (which are all pretty standard from my days of contracting). However, I'd like to know what other types of insurances a business like mine needs? Also can you recommend a company to speak with for this type of insurance?

For every possible risk, you can find insurance. Case in point: [Alien Abduction Insurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction_insurance). 

Your best bet is to find a local commercial insurance broker. Go local so you can meet with them in person and get to know them. Think of your insurance agent like a CPA or lawyer: they're a professional you want to have around as you grow your business.
