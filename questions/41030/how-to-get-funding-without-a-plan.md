I really don't have a "plan" right now, but have been offered a meeting to pitch to an entrepreneur that has already sold at least two companies they founded each for over 100 million. They know I don't have a plan, and still agreed to meet. Any suggestions?

You might say that your goal is to start a company and that you plan to use your business acumen to find founders that have a viable business model. And then, once you'll find them, you'll join the team to scale the business, for which you'll need the capital that these investors have.

I think that if I were an investor and found someone smart who would be willing to invest 3-6 months to find me a good startup investment, I'd give him some money to go about doing this.

**So to answer your question, you might say that your plan is to find a startup worth investing into.**

You many not have a written business plan, but I hope you have a plan and are prepared to sell. 

By sell, I mean you should be able to demo your concept, sell yourself / team / unique value proposition, abilities to go from concept to launch with the appropriate research & burn levels.  IF you are a known entity to the entrepreneur, then many of these things have already been vetted.

I know what you mean about not having an actual plan.  Mine is in my head and it is very detailed and quite perfect so why would I have to write it down?  

I would say just suck it up and start writing and it will be done before you know it.  There are guides online to help you organize and get started.  Investors unfortunatly like cold hard facts and figures before they part with their hard earned money on a smile and a promise.  :)
