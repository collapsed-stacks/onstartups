My partner and I have founded a British LTD, are registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, intend to start trading in The Netherlands this fall, and we will have a Dutch BV or NV by end of year.  We need to also setup a US-based entity, probably in Delaware or Nevada.  (Those states are by no means a requirement--they just sounds like the quickest, cheapest and easiest states to work with.)  

The purpose of this entity is three fold:

 - employ a remote employee (and minority shareholder), probably in Massachusetts
 - purchase goods and services in the US
   - save cash, thanks to the very weak dollar
   - some things we need are only available in the US
 - register trademarks and copyrights

If it matters, I am a US citizen.

So, the question: **What types of companies can be owned fully by a foreign entity?**  Are their restrictions or hidden costs?

<p>I have helped approximately 30 foreign clients (mostly European, many Dutch) start up and build businesses here in the U.S.</p>

<p>The process generally is straightforward (e.g., to form a corporation), but there are a few tricky issues (such as obtaining an Employer Identification Number and opening a bank account - though both may be easier if you have an employee here).</p>

<p>I recommend that you go to my blog's <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/foreign-countries/" rel="nofollow">Foreign Countries</a> page and read every relevant post that the links take you to. If you then have remaining questions, you may contact me directly.</p>
