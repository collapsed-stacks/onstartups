I have been a co-founder of a start-up that is beginning to take off and make some noise and hopefully is on the right path :)

The question arises because until now the 3 co-founders (me & a friend + another who joined us on the way) haven't signed an agreement yet.

The stakes we would have in the company were decided a while ago. 
The friend I work with is someone I know since I was at school, hence its moved so far since then with verbal agreement. Only new thing is that he would have right to an irrevocable proxy.

My question is *How could an irrevocable proxy go go wrong for me ?*

Things to note:

1. This company has been operating for a while now, about 8 months so our product is almost ready and we have clients waiting for deployment.

2. I am the technical founder of the company, I manage 6 technical employees remotely, help make business decisions and code myself in the remaining time, I do not get paid, have no monetary investment in the company and am still a student at university ( for another 2 months, after which i'll switch to this full time ).

3. The 2nd co-founder came up with the business idea, had put in all the investment to get the company where it is (quite a bit until now), manages ideas, timeliness, business contacts and sales. He is the one who is asking for rights to an irrevocable proxy.

4. The 3rd co-founder joined us along the way and handles only sales & clients at the moment.

5. The reason why I ask the question is not because I do not trust my co-workers currently, but I would still like to know what I'm going in for.

Thanks!
