I'm considering how to structure my product tour and was wondering what the best approach would be with regards to the page flow.

Currently, I have split the entire tour into 7 subpages.


----- Product tour -----
   

 

    01. Explaining the service
    02. Why you need it
    03. How it works
    04. Features
    05. Handling main objection I: security
    06. Handling main objection II: price
    07. Testimonials

----- Sign up starts here -----

    08. Insert your details
    09. Pay entry level fee on Paypal
    10. Enter the app and view intro videos

However, I'm worried that some users might become impatient and bounce because you have to click a lot to get through to page number 10. Also, you do not really know where exactly you are and how long the tour is going to take until you reach the end.

The entire tour is very nicely designed to keep the user interested. For those who are impatient I put a Buy It Now button onto every subpage.

I have seen several sales pages where all the information resides within one long page and now read the following article: http://www.astrodigital.org/digital/shortvslongpages.html

My question is, what's your take on this? Does sb maybe have some data on what boosts conversion? Should I go with the 10 pages approach, show the user where he is at all times, cut it down to maybe 5-6 pages, or put it all into one page? I was even thinking about showing 2-3 different tours and see what converts more users, but maybe sb has already done that?

Thanks in advance for all your helpful advice!

Can you do some sort of tabbed UI? Keep the first 7 items in the tab, ending with a "Click Here to get Started" which takes you to the sign up page, collects your info and payment, and sends you off to the app.

Basically, you're right - the more clicks, the higher the bounce rate. After all, you have the potential to lose someone with each click, so reducing the clicks needed to move forward reduces the frustration visitors will have with your form. 

So the practical suggestions would be:

 1. **Reduce the page count**: instead of 10 pages, page 1 will cover steps 1-7 and page 2 will cover steps 8-10;
 2. **Show progress visibly**: have some sort of counter, e.g. Step 3 of 7, at every step of the way (this should be trivial to add to your current set up) so people know how much further they have to go;
 3. **Allow short-cutting**: place a fairly obvious way to jump directly to sign up without going through the promotional material.

Generally speaking, less is more on a business page. Leading brands tend to use 5 pages plus or minus 2. So an acceptable range would be 3-7 pages. Keep the following in mind:

 1. **Brand = Category + Target Market + Point of Difference.** Your page should define your product or service (category), address the customer (target market), and tell why your product or service is worth trying (point of difference). You'll want to do this in the most concise and creative way possible. 
 2. **Use your website to interact with your target market** You may want to have a blog page, mine is www.rayceonblog.com Its designed to make yourselve a thought-leader on a particular subject and to interact with your market via comment posts and responses. Also check out SnapEngage, which allows you to chat with people that are browsing your page for more that 15 seconds. 
 3. **Keep your message consistent** Whether you decide to have 3 pages or 7 pages, make sure that each photo, tagline, and write up reinforces your brand. 

Quality over Quantity Dude..... Good Luck
