You mean domain name?

Ideally:

floorplan(s).com

officeplan(s).com

roomdesign.com

freefloorplans.com

etc

Use the Adwords Keyword tool to know what people search, and check exact search volume, then try to get the .com if you can afford it. This will give you a memorable name, make you look serious, and will help SEO.


If you mean product name, I think it doesn't really matter a iota compared to the domain name. What matters is:

-  will people find your site?

- will they remember your website address 10 days later?

Floored Genius (the .com is registered but not currently used for anything so may be acquirable).
