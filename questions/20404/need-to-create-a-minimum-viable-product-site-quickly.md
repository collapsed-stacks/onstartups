I have a few ideas that I need to validate. Is there any offering that lets me quickly create MVP sites? I'd need:

 1. Website design template
 2. A way to capture user's email address so that they can be notified later
 3. A way to add a few web pages (preferably in ASP.NET) that has minimum functionality (I will be coding this part)

I know all this can be done in a few weeks but I'd rather focus on the core functionality and purchase a service that lets me use precanned templates for design etc.

Theme Forest is a really great site for finding beautiful, cheap front end templates. Perhaps that could be of use? You can usually get this up and running in minutes. Put a Wordpress backend on it, and that's your CMS system covered also.

Hope that helps.

<p>Try <a href="http://www.drupalgardens.com/" rel="nofollow">Drupal Gardens</a></p>

<p>Drupal has plenty of community modules with features similar to what you're looking for, though I'm not sure if Drupal Gardens provides that level of customization. Also, it's largely php/mysql based, not in ASP.NET.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unbounce.com" rel="nofollow">Unbounce</a> lets you collect emails and has predesigned themes. I haven't used it myself, but from what I see, you can get a landing page about in about 1 hour.</p>

<p>You could also try getting an invite from <a href="http://launchrock.com/" rel="nofollow">LaunchRock</a>, which is a landing page service similar to Unbounce, but has a more viral nature to it. </p>

<p>For building your site, use <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" rel="nofollow">Wordpress</a> and buy a premium theme on <a href="http://www.themeforest.com" rel="nofollow">ThemeForest</a>. You can get a beautiful looking sales site up in less than a day.</p>

I would just install wordpress, install the mailchimp like plugins and be done with it. Pick free themes for each one and you will be all set in few hours.

I use mediatemple and servint and both of them have wordpress as one click installs. So I can setup multiple websites in less than an hour. I use blogdesk to add content to each of my sites.

Looks like weebly, the free website service - www.weebly.com - supports asp.net.  See the comment here that looks like it's from someone at weebly  - http://askville.amazon.com/weebly-make-website-put-rating-system/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=50381822
