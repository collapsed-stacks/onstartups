I want to begin to write a Software with my 2 other friends.I worked hard on c#  for 4 years and they worked on it approximately for 1 year.Now One Of them got this project and want to make it with each other.

I want to know is it correct to have same income from the income of this project?

i think for example my friends can easily use my written codes in this project as a sample for their other works with no effort(unlike me) but with no profit for me!

Skill mostly depend on what kind of projects or teams you are exposed to during your tenure, not just on the length of somebody in the field. 

Income from this project should commensurate with your role on this project.

For startup's with no income stream yet, the strife that occurs with the differences in Salary between the 3 partners is enough to shut down the product or company or idea before you even have a chance to make a difference.

All other things being equal, I would say that the income should be commensurate with the amount of experience and skill the members bring to the team.  However if one of the friends actually secured the project (as in: someone wants to hire a team to complete the project, and your friend is the connection), then their link to the source of work increases their importance to the project.  Sure, you might be able to develop it without them, but would you even have the chance without them?  It could be a delicate issue.

The distinction depends on how you mean 'one of them got this project'.  If they just have an 'idea' for a project, then it is not unreasonable for you to lobby for a higher share.  

Just be prepared for them to reject your request.

Well , I dont think that you are greedy at all . Its human nature that you you think that you should get a fair share for what you have worked for.
But the problem is that are you sure that you want to work with some guys for long term when you are not sure that you will get a fair share.
But if it is for this is project only than you can **Divide project in tasks and pay per task**.
So as you are much more experienced so you will be able to do more tasks so getting paid more in the end.
By the way if you are in the project with some one then you should be ready to share your experience with your project team members. Otherwise dont expect this project to complete successfully.
