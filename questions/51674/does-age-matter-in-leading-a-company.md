<p>I was thinking to start something of my own. Sometimes, I feel I am too young to get all this started. I think I need to be more experienced. Any suggestion guys, what should I do? I know this is my own life. I should take these type of decisions myself but your suggestion could show me path.</p>

<p>I set up my company at uni when I was 19 with my business partner. </p>

<p>We're a company of 6 (been as big as 10) and I don't think age really matters. Granted we've hired people near our age, but we've had 30+ year old employee. </p>

<p>I think a lot depends on you and if you are capable more than your age. sure, you'll always fund people that think you're too young or won't want to be told to do things by someone younger, but that's why you have interviews fit employees and those clients that care tend to lose out by being like that.</p>

<p>I suppose it also depends on your sector / what you want to do. You can probably have more experience in some things than a 50 yo, or less in others.</p>

<p>I never regretted my decision to leave university and continue and now my age never matters as our work shows our ability.</p>

<p>Is your issue your age or lack of experience as they are very different things?</p>

<p>I have worked with people in their 20's who were geniuses and so switched on yet others in their 40's and 50's were the exact opposite - age in itself does not equal experience or lack of and it is a very individual thing.</p>
