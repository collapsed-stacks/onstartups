Your question is rather vague, however I'd like to advise you to determine your desired 'proper recoginition' **in numbers**.

Recognition implies getting more clients, so the first step is to decide:

**Do you need recognition or do you need more clients?**

If you need more clients, then the next step will be to

**Determine how many new clients do you want to get.**

After that you should consider you marketing budget:

**How much money do you have to spend on marketing activities?**

In case of this number is null, you may consider doing all the marketing stuff by yourselves:

**How much spare time do you have to do marketing?**

Depending on the derived numbers you  can then choose appropriate marketing techiques and channels.

"Achieve proper recognition in our field".

I believe such thing for a web development company is a bit out of scope.

For example:
RackSpace has a great recognition among hosting companies but the field is a well defined area.

Web Development on the other side is a very broad area. Can mean anything from web design to the next search engine to beat Google.

How you distinguish your company from the others?

Try to get recognition among your clients and your reparation will bring more...
