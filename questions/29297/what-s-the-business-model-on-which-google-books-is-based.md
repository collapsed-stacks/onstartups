<p>It's an advertising model; specifically contextual/targeted advertising in the Google Books example you mentioned.</p>

<p>You can read about business models on the web <a href="http://digitalenterprise.org/models/models.html#Advertising" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The same site also lists some good links on Google <a href="http://digitalenterprise.org/cases/google.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Google also provides some excellent information on their key technologies and insight into the technical principles behind their products <a href="http://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/tech.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
