Assuming one wants to launch a website with good reviews from beta-testers-users, is it worth spending money on Search Engine Optimization consulting/specialists or does a hacker with good IT skills and time to read articles/posts on the net can produce the same value by himself?

Has anyone experience to share? Is the return worth the investment?

If you were talking about something that would be a one-off task (like setting up a company) I would recommend paying a professional.  But if a function or task is going to be an **ongoing part of your company**, it is best to learn those skills yourself or bring in someone with those skills.  

From what you have said, I'm guessing that SEO is going to continue to be important to you, and so I would strongly recommend **learning about it yourself**.  It's not actually that hard, and in many ways SEO is still a bit of a black art.  We don't know (although we would love to) exactly how Google's algorithm works, but they do give hints at what is important from time to time.

That way you not only **save on the cost of a consultant**, but you also gain a **new** and valuable **skill** that will help you make **better decisions** in the future.

As John mentioned, there are two ways to think about SEO. The first is a one-time investment during a site redesign, to make sure your site is structured based on SEO best practices. But this only gets you a small part of the way there if you really want your content to rank well.

SEO should be a factor in every piece of content that goes up on your site, like blog posts or landing pages. This means mainly three things:

 - Use language in your copy that's consistent with the keywords you're trying to rank for
 - Include lots of internal linking between sections and pages on your site
 - Consider all of the places you could get inbound links to your content from other sites 

SEO is surprisingly simple, but it must be considered whenever you add *any new content* to your site in order for you to get the most value from it.

I'm not sure that having an outside SEO consultant would really help much with these day-to-day SEO considerations. 

By the way, if you decide you'd like to have some outside help, HubSpot put together a great guide on how to spot a bad SEO consultant that you might find useful:
