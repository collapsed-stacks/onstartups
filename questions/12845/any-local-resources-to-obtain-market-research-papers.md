I own a startup software company and I need access to couple of papers which were published by an independent firm called datamonitor. Its market research papers and was recently released. 

I am looking at their prices and they are ridiculously high. [High 4 figures for each and I dont really know the actual content! I mean, I dont really want to pay $8000 to read a 100 page report especially when I dont know if it directly applies to my industry.] Now when I was in college, I had access to all the various journals in different disciplines from a single portal through our library. So it did not matter which journal the paper was published in, I could search and access it.

Is there any thing like that for these kind of reports? If not, what is the best way to get access to them.

I approached our local SBA guy. He doesnot even know all the resources he had access to. He wanted me to come up with papers and he will check if he could get it through his "staff". And obviously, the ones I wanted, he has no access to....

Dont know if I could, but ideally I would like a super subscription to marketresearch.com so that I can "do" research. If not, could you suggest me alternative way to go about it?

What I am looking for, 
- research done in my area about the business, logic, and future direction, prospects, etc
- research done in my area about the competitors and their financials and info etc. 

Also another site which has some info I need is at hoovers.com But I think I can afford premium membership for that site. But again, any free resources for that would be good too. Apologize for being so stingy. Seriously running low on cash.

Thank you in advance/

<p>There is an organization called the Institute for Economic Development. Here is a link to their organization; <a href="http://iedtexas.org/" rel="nofollow">IED</a>. Based out of University of Texas at San Antonio, the IED services every SBDC center in the United States with economic research and data.</p>

<p>They can provide you with all the market research you could ever want. But, it is up to you to request this data with as much specificity as possible, otherwise, they really won't know how to process your request as these "market research papers" are put together on demand, by the economic development counselors themselves. This is where the SBDC comes into play as a guiding force in identifying relevant market data. Since you have a lameduck for a SBA counselor, you will have to find out what kind of market research you need. I highly recommend you get directly to the people in charge of your local operation, get in their face, and get comfortable. They are paid for by the United States government to stimulate local economic activity. They are there to help you.</p>

<p>To help you better understand the process by which these reports are written you should be aware of the raw data that is used to write them. Tax information from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, <a href="http://bls.gov/" rel="nofollow">BLS.gov</a>, Census Bureau, <a href="http://www.census.gov/" rel="nofollow">CB</a>, and other public databases. When tracking these figures they use NAICS codes to pull information relevant to your specific industry.</p>

<p>Here are a few NAICS relating to software. I didn't even do a search for "Computer" or "Programming", which I recommend you look up among other terms of interest. Here is a link you can use to identify your specific industry in the eyes of the government. <a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch" rel="nofollow">NAICS</a> </p>

<p>541511  Software programming services, custom computer</p>

<p>541512  Computer software consulting services or consultants</p>

<p>541519  Software installation services, computer</p>

<p>611420  Computer software training</p>

<p>611420  Software application training</p>

<p>Finally here is part of an email I sent to my local SBDC in requesting 2 specific reports; a Nielson Claritas PRIZM report (which features a breakdown of prominent personalities and lifestyles of professionals in my region) and a Gap Analysis report which can be used in determining market potential for industries and services.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our company will offer programming services to businesses in the form
  of mobile applications (i.e. iPhone, Android Applications, as well as
  web applications for other smartphone devices) which falls under NAICS
  Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services. With the continued
  evolution of mobile technology and replacement of traditional mobile
  devices with ones enhanced for web usage, we believe there will be a
  substantial increase in internet consumption outside of home and
  office computing.</p>
  
  <p>Here is a written request for the data I was informed to look for:</p>
  
  <p>1)  Top PRIZM Lifestyle Segments for Brazos County, by Nielsen
  Claritas PRIZM.
       (accessible through sbdcnet.org)</p>
  
  <p>2)  Gap Analysis report for 541511 Custom Software Services in and
  surrounding the Brazos Valley, TX (Gap Analysis)</p>
  
  <p>3)  Any information regarding the sales of mobile devices and contract
  purchases through mobile vendors (i.e. AT&amp;T stores, Verizon stores,
  and other smartphone retailers.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good luck on your business.</p>

Did you asked at your local Camber of Commerce. They should have a bit of what you are looking for I guess.

Are there any University Libraries in your Area, where you could access Information for a Membership Fee?

Is there an Association for your Industry, which might have what you are looking for, even if the Association is a nationwide one.

Usually these sources provide the information you need in one way or the other.

And sometimes the information might be available for free as well. 

Hope this helps.

Find a university, local or otherwise and bring the concept to their business department or the applicable department for which you need a research paper (e.g. psychology department if you need info on use habits, etc.). If there is already research on what you need anyone at the university level will have access to IBIS World, and other major research firms. If not the university will be able to assist you in a number of ways. You can spin this need for a research paper into a working relationship with the university which will provide you with additional resources.
