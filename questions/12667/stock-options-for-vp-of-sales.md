The numbers vary greatly based on stage of startup, experience of the VP, etc.

There are generally three parts to the compensation:  Some base salary, some performance-based bonus/commission and some options.

For a $5 million software startup, something around a 1-1.5% is relatively common.

1--1.5%.  Usually will be less than your VP of Marketing, but all these things can vary quite a bit.  You probably should buy some comp data if your VCs don't have any (you can get some data for under $1k) so you know what ranges make sense for all the jobs you need to fill.  Your VCs likely have some metrics for compensation in their own portfolio available, minimally.
