Is it typical for a company to ask its CTO/COO/CXO's (non-founder) to sign an NDA?  Seems odd since they're the creating much of the strategy information they're designed to protect.

It is more likely that the employment contract has clauses about disclosure, non-compete, confidential information, etc.

Usually in my experience an NDA is executed between parties with no common entity.  

What you suggest is fine, but more likely the employment contract is more inclusive.

It should be part of a standard employment agreement but there may be specific NDAs around shared IP or business dealings that they ask them to sign.

As a company owner when you sign with a client/third party your signing that all staff in your company will be bound by that agreement not just you. Companies often have backing agreements to ensure their risk is covered and that everyone knows what the rules are.

Look up "proprietary rights agreement" and that type of document will include NDA provisions.  the above posts are correct.
