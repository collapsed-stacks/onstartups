I'm trying to understand some issues on copyright.

I was wondering if I have a web application that allows "friends/peers" to share music lyrics, is it infringing on copyrights?

Basically I'm also curious how does bittorrent handles the "sharing" of copyrighted materials.

This is a fair question, because it's more tricky than you'd think.

Someone who copies copyrighted materials (for instance music lyrics, most are copyrighted), is committing copyright infringment and could be sued. You as the provider of such a service, may initially appear to be safe. But if it can be shown that the only use for your service is to copy illegal material, then you could be liable too.

BitTorrent doesn't have any protection either.
