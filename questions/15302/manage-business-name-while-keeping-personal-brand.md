I am going to start doing freelance web development starting in the next couple of months, but on the side I a going to work on some software to put forth in a SaaS model. I would like to do everything under my DBA name, which isn't my personal name, since I plan to move to doing only SaaS and custom software. 

Should I just approach it as personally doing the work just have all checks written out to the DBA name? things like that?

Yes it probably makes sense to have checks addressed to your business name, especially if that's the brand you'll be developing.

You should have a quick chat with an accountant. There's tax implications on having income coming into your personal name, so you might want to set up a holding company of some sort. You'll want to be prepared ahead of time, so you're not hit with unexpected tax issues.
