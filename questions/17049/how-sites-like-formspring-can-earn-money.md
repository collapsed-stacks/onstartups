Lots of websites did not show ad in their first or even after their seconds year. Youtube show ads 4-5 years after their initial. I think 1 year after Google bought it.

I think the site you are talking about will show ads in future.

<p>So formspring seems to me to be into two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating community spaces for questions and answers</li>
<li>Getting users on facebook</li>
</ol>

<p>So I'm guessing that you're interested in at least one of those areas.</p>

<p>Q&amp;A has a whole host of possibilities. But behind the apparent simplicity, there can be a lot of complexity. On the 'leveraging the web' front, there are hosts of players.</p>

<p><a href="http://j.mp/TruKQ" rel="nofollow">Ask Trueknowledge the question, "How will trueknowledge make money?"</a> and (as of today) you'll get the answer, "We don't yet have an answer to that question,"  plus an invitation to suggest an answer.</p>

<p>Communities built around informed questions and answers really create value. You're here in one, after all.</p>

<p>If you have a great idea to create community like that, your main choice right now is targeted in-site advertising - now or at the point you have the scale and data. Which you could be one of the lucky ones who makes a living or builds a business from. </p>

<p>Or there's selling the data - which kind of sucks.</p>

And somewebsites love to collect information and sell it!  They might not necessarily be selling the actual email addresses or private data, but more data modeling stuff.  I think a site like survey monkey could earn well selling their data.

So, you're asking us for a money making web site that will earn you a fortunate? If we had such an idea, do you really think we'd give it to someone else?
