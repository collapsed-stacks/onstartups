Is intellectual property considered a commodity?  Can intellectual property be bought and/or sold like other commodity type goods?

Intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks) can be bought and sold, but I would not call it a commodity.

Since each piece of intellectual property is unique, placing value on it is very difficult and is much more art than science.

For example, consider a patent.  A patent only has value if others infringe it (or want to practice it) and you can get royalties from them.  There are a lot of variables in determining value:

 - Do others actually infringe the patent?  Patents are often hard to understand and the only way to truly determine this is to litigate.
 - Is the patent valid?  Many patents are invalidated in litigation as the patent office often misses key prior art.
 - Can the infringer design around your patent and accomplish the same objective without infringing?
 - Can the infringer afford to pay you a royalty or will it put him out of business?

Put a patent in front of 10 IP lawyers and ask them to place a value on it and you will get very different answers.
