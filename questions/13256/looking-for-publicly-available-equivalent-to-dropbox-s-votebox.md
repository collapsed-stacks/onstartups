## Looking for publicly available equivalent to Dropbox's Votebox

Couldn't find any relevant previous questions on this subject - feel free to refer me if I missed something.

I have been impressed by **Dropbox's feature voting system, Votebox** - see https://www.dropbox.com/help/136 for a description.

I'd like to add something similar when I launch my product site - it looks like Dropbox have put a lot of work into their version - has anyone got positive experiences with any commercial (or OSS) products that achieve the same sort of thing?  

I'd be happy with hosted or self-hosted, open source or commercial (as long as the licensing costs are reasonable).  It just needs to integrate "seamlessly" into my site (e.g., features.mysite.com, etc.).

Many thanks in advance - Steve.

Have you looked at UserVoice or GetSatisfaction? maybe one of those services will suffice your needs. If not, I'll appreciate it if you could reply with details... maybe there is a potential for a new competitor...
