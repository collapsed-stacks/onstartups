I currently work full time for a private company and am considering on starting up my own online software company by forming a private limited company.  I had a few questions:

 1. I've noticed that the current VAT threshold for VAT registration is currently set at ~Â£70k, does this threshold take into consideration personal income from my full time job?  It is likely I will exceed this limit if this includes both my salaried job income and the turnover from the registered company, therefore this is the reason for asking the question.
 2. Is it mandatory for private limited companies to be VAT registered?
 3. I personally would like to avoid VAT registration at present merely because I would see no advantage for my business except for a professional image.  I will be running an online software company which will only have a few minor overheads, therefore I see no benefit in claiming a small amount of VAT.  Can anyone see any pitfalls in this approach?

Regards,
Ben

Your personal income is separate from your company's revenue.  You and your company are separate legal entities.

The VAT threshold applies to your company (self-employed traders also have to consider VAT but that doesn't appear to be relevant in your situation if your other job is not self-employment).

You are only obliged to register for VAT if you reach the threshold.  Below the threshold you may choose to register voluntarily.  This can be advantageous as you can claim back the VAT on your business expenses.  It depends whether the money you can claim back is more than the money you lose by having to include VAT in your prices.

If you sell to other VAT registered businesses, they won't care about the VAT in the price as they too can claim it back.  In this case it's probably advantageous to register.  If you sell to consumers, they can't claim back the VAT so you'd probably want to avoid increasing the price that they pay until you have to.

Ben, I might be partial but have you considered setting up in the States or somewhere a bit more tax friendly?  Unless your market is the UK market, or your startup is limited in some way strongly consider setting up in the USA.

As a UK citizen you will be taxed on your income in the US.  But our tax system is still a bit lower, and this approach gives you greater access to US companies.  

Just a thought.
