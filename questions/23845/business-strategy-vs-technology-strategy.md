In essence my question is: is a CTO supposed to provide the company vision and business strategy?

I am bringing into a startup the following: vision, business strrategy, technology strategy/roadmap and initial critical engineering staff. I am being offered the job as CTO (my proposed title). The founding CEO & President is bringing the funding, and will be in charge of accounting, facilities and overall day-to-day operations.

It is me, not him, bringing vision, business strategy, initial customers and potential contacts for the near future.

I am proposing that my title be CTO and VP of Strategy. He is saying I will be the CTO, and my job descruiption includes Strategy, Vision, Technology Implementation, Deployment of product and Business Development.

Is he or is he not trying to lowball me? I feel I deserve more. Please help!

I'm not trying to invalidate your question, but why does it matter in a startup, if you're happy with the role, shareholding and terms?

Job title is usually a broad brush indication of role in a small co - as the company grows the roles will change, and titles will become more real.

This may just be incorrect personal opinion but I've always thought precise job titles more about position in hierarchy in larger enterprises.  In a startup you're far more likely to get involved in anything you have awareness of or time to do than performing to a tightly defined and described role.

So no I don't think the job title by itself is any indicator of being short changed, whereas only getting 5% might well do.

Though titles don't matter, there must be a good agreement between you and the CEO on what each would do and what kind of compensation is adequate for those responsibilities. I do know if CTOs that do strategy and i think CTOs definitely participate somewhat in BizDev/ Sales and Vision.

It seems to me from your tone that: 1) you feel shortchanged by the CEO and 2) you think he isn't doing that much comparatively (at least that's what I pick up). May I ask then, Why do you want to start a venture with a guy with whom you feel that way?

Titles mean nothing..I would stick with CTO and all CTO or any executive level names usually means all parties participate in the strategy, vision and mission of the company including bringing in their contacts. If their is two of you you should be co-founders.
