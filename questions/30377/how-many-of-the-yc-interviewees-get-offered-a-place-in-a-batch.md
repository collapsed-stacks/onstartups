<p>YC doesn't really publicize this data. However, a rough estimation is around a third of teams are selected from the interview round- see this <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/07/features/meet-generation-y?page=all" rel="nofollow" title="Wired">article</a> in Wired for some numbers on an incoming class. The odds of getting selected for an interview are much lower- YC only invites around 70-80 teams to interview according to their <a href="http://ycombinator.com/whynot.html" rel="nofollow" title="site">site</a></p>
