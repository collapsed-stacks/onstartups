I want to approach a business that provides a complementary service to a service I offer. The service I offer is a monthly recurring charge and an upfront charge of, say, $500 and monthly $9. I'd like to approach a business and say, "If you market me to your customers and we get a sale, I'll give you 25% of the initial payment."

What is this called? (I'm asking partly so I can do some research on it)
Has anyone done stuff like this? Are other businesses normally receptive? 
What do I need to watch out for? Is a legal agreement necessary? 
Any tips on approaching the other business. eg. how to ask for this

I'm thinking of possibly doing a little contest too and giving one away for free (maybe, maybe not). 

Anyone have any thoughts or experiences to share on this? 

Thanks!

This is called affiliate marketing.  The person who you are hoping to market your product (whether or not it is in addition to their own) they would be called an "affiliate" of yours.  

Affiliate marketing is very common and makes a lot of business sense for your affiliates -- assuming you are not offering a competing product.  

The best way to approach potential affiliates is to call them and explain what you are willing to offer them and what you expect in return.

My company can help you get all this going, feel free to email with any other questions.

Good Luck

Sounds like they would be a "reseller" of your services. I think it's important to look at the transparency of this type of partnership or affiliation with the company who will be marketing your services to their customers.

We've worked with several businesses like this and the most important things I've found to promote to potential resellers would be a) How much they get per sale (which it sounds like you already have figured out) and, b) Who manages what and how?

Unfortunately, in a lot of cases the reseller may market a person or company's services or products and they service or products given are not as expected or the customer isn't happy for whatever reason. Make sure you figure this stuff out before it leads to unhappy buyers and potentially causing issues with your resellers.

Digital Point forums, Sitepoint marketplace (http://marketplace.sitepoint.com/), and a few similar sites might have a channel for you to promote to resellers (if your service is web-based).

Cheers!
