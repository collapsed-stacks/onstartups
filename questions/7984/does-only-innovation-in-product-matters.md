I am having a startup, in a space where already there are bunch of companies. But still i see there is a huge chunk of market very much untapped. I did a little bit of market research, and have found few beta customers, who are ready to tryout the product. Also demographically, the market which is been tapped by those early companies are mostly US and Europe. But their presence in Asian markets is very much minimal and i plan to capitalize on that. However, the product we are building have almost similar features as there in existing products, with a lot better user experience and some very crucial modifications. But overall i should be honest to say its not a very new concept. I need to know from your experience, does only innovative product sells? 

And in such a scenario, how should i approach in marketing for the product. Is there any resource which i could look into.

Thanks
