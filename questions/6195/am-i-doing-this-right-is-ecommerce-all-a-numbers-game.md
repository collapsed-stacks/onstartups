Am I right in assuming if I can figure out the amount of sales I need to cover my monthly expenses and make a profit, that I must then simply drive enough visitors to my website to cover a 2% conversion rate? 

When you started your online business, did you know these specifics? Were your expenses to drive traffic higher than you expected? What was your start-up experience, and what did you learn?

In a sense every product business on Earth can be broken down as "you need to cover your monthly expenses, you convert at X%, so you need N people in the front to N*X dollars."

Thing is, that's true of both the companies who are successful and those who aren't.  So that in itself is true but unhelpful.  It's like saying "Human beings need to eat or else they'll die."  Yes, but everyone dies whether or not they eat!

So the real question is: How do I get *quality* traffic?  How do I develop a product people actually want?  How do I separate myself from competition?  How do I market without spending too much money?  How do I get happy customers to tell their friends?  How do I get the media to give me free marketing?

Of course these can't be answered in one go, because they're the fundamental questions of all companies...

This is true mathematically, but it's bad business. You don't want to target 2% of a really big number, you want to target 100% of a smaller number. You want every visitor to your site to leave with a good impression, not hope for 1-2% who will buy something.

Yes, the quantity matters, but the quality of you visitors matters more.

Basing your business plan and business model solely on driving traffic seems like a bad way to differentiate.  If that is the case why not just open a MacDonalds?

Focus on quality and content.

You need to be organized, disciplined and knowledgable enough to know what elements of your website drive these numbers. It's sort of like an experiment. You make a single change and compare the before and after. You'll never know if it was the color, layout, sign-up method, speed of your site, or any/all combinations if you just "wing-it" and don't analyze your traffic and sales conversion numbers.

I'm sure convenience stores have a better closing rate than high-end retailers, but what does that really tell you? Get out of the diamond business and start selling beef jerky.

I have 2 websites in a completely different industries. My average conversion rates are 1.17% & 0.65%. Each website generates 1,000-3,000 visitors per day. Both are very, very profitable. Point is, it depends on your industry.

If you product is a commodity (or positioned as such) its all a numbers game, based on your price you will get x number of sales per  y number of site visits. If its not a commodity, then factors like features, branding, promotion, etc will have a much stronger impact on sales then just the number of visitors.
