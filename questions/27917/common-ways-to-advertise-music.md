I'm trying to begin an indie record label. I already know how to get music onto iTunes and Amazon Music, already have the knowledge to build a site and a general idea of what it should look like, the legal aspects of record labels, etc. The one thing that I am unable to find any good information on is advertising music. The only real advertisements I see for music are either for concerts, or for new albums on the front page of iTunes. I thought maybe about trying to contact others about putting my label's music in their media (videos, games, etc.), but I'm still not entirely sure that would be an effective way to advertise my label's music and for me to earn a profit.

So, question: What are some common ways to advertise music?

The year I spent in a band we were able to get our songs visable and and used in independant / uni films. The goal was from there to build it up so that the profile got out futher. 

... then it was generally agreed that as far as rock star goes, I make a far better programmer/entrepreneur :)

Wish I could help more, I think its a question generally for your industry at the moment. 

Few ideas I have had while writing this:

 - Have the "Labels" website with all bands ... goal is got drive qualified and interested traffic here ... typically 3-5% of this traffic will purchase in any given timeframe.
 - Start an online radio station of the bands you are promoting on your site. Have cross over links to other labels and give them some juice as well ... they will likely mention you in return. 
 - Identifying the top 10 or so sites that promote music (myspace, www.mp3.com etc) and becoming active on them every day or so posting a few things up there about each label, engaging potentially interested people and drawing them back into your primary sites.

Once you have a bit of practice at it you could outsource parts of that work to a VA fairly easily ... 

BUT, becareful, what I have outlined above done well works ... if you a genuine ... if its not done well it falls under the catagory of SPAM / junk and will more likely hurt your brand and your bands.

Thats about all I have, look forward to seeing what others think.

Here are a few things you could do:

1. Create a program and generate content. My friend Amy wrote an entire program for Clear Channel Radio called, The Movement http://www.power99.com/pages/the-movement/

2. Do free shows at local cafes, bars, and lounges and post the video on Youtube. If its good it'll go viral. 

3. Subscribe to Taxi which will give you a list of movies, tv shows, and established artist looking for specific genres of music. You can submit one of your songs if it fits. 

The music industry is ALL-KINDS of competitive so you'll ready need to be creative. On the flip side, social media gives everyone a platform to audition. Good music marketed to the right target audience always sells. Stay Encouraged!

Good Luck.
