What do you think of $1/download idea ? For example if you've designed wordpress theme its still basically free to use but to download it you would pay $1 for it. This eliminates the need for donations, which like we all know don't do much now a days. Thanks.

Good Wordpress themes are worth far more than $1 and there are plenty of sites that sell themes such as www.ThemeForest.com

Pricing your theme(s) at a dollar might attract a lot of downloads, or it might turn people off as being "too cheap = bad". Assuming you want to make money from selling themes, I'd suggest you read up on the theories of elastic pricing.
