I agree with the answer that Jed gave you, to sell yourself you need to sell your service, but don't make a sales pitch right away.  They will want to make sure that you have a solid business plan.  If you haven't written your plan yet, your business is still in the early stages and it's too soon to try to sell yourself. 

A company's business plan is what lenders such as banks and the U.S. Small Business Administration use in deciding to lend you money. It's the main company
document that your employees -- and you -- use to gauge your company's success and to make decisions about what you should do first, second, or not at all. 

If you're starting a home-based business on a shoestring, some of these suggestions probably aren't necessary, but you still should create a plan that outlines your goals, expected costs, marketing plan and exit strategy. A business plan is your key to start selling yourself.

Good luck to you!

When discussing your product or service, the company should view it as an investment opportunity.  They should believe they will receive significantly more as a return then they have invested.  When you have the opportunity, discuss what benefits they will receive.  
 
There is also a right time and place to have these discussions.  I don’t think that anyone likes a sales pitch the first time they meet someone.  You might want to read “Book Yourself Solid” by Michael Port.

I am guessing you have an appointment and are selling a product or service to a potential customer who is a company.  My advice:

 - Be considerate of the potential customer's time and situation.
 - Be upfront and honest on what you can and cannot deliver.
 - Build trust.
 - Show them what your product or service can do for their business.
 - Make sure the sale is a win-win for both you and the customer.
 - Give references from other customers or jobs you worked on.
