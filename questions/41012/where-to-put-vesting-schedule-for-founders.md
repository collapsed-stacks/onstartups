For a new corporation, should the vesting schedule and related conditions be written in the Articles of Incorporation, Shareholders Agreement or as a separate document?

Each founder should have a separate agreement (often called a "Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement") which specifies the vesting schedule.  

Also, the founders should seriously consider filing an 83(b) election.
