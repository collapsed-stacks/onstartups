<p>I'm part of a 4-member software dev team that has received a pitch from a startup to come on board and get their product launched. The deal is 100% equity, so obviously a risky venture for us.</p>

<p>I'm relatively sold on the concept and deal except for what I see as a ridiculous vesting schedule. Standard vesting is time-based, but they are choosing to go with performance-based vesting e.g. 10,000 users = 25% of our allocation vested, 100,000 = 50%, 1 million = 75%, company in net profit = 100%. There is a time limit of 3 years placed on this.</p>

<p>As I see it, as a developer I have very little influence over any of those targets. It depends almost entirely on how well the site is marketed among other things. Additionally, the 3 year cap seems unfair. If the project turns out to be a slow-burner and achieves success after 3 years, we get nothing (or very little).</p>

<p>Just wanting some opinions from others really. Is this kind of thing becoming more popular? To me it makes little sense and I'm ready to drop out of the deal if it can't be changed. Thanks.</p>

<p>That doesn't seem like a very attractive venture. You're placing your fate at the hands of the non-technical members of the team, and your equity is essentially controlled by the business's overall performance. I wouldn't recommend this even if the time frame was half of a year.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you either work out a monetary deal or one split between salary and equity. Vesting a dev team based on user base is simply is a deal you should avoid.</p>
