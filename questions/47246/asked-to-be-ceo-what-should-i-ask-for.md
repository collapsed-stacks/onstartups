I have been appoached by a private equity firm that has an idea -- a good one -- and $5M.  They've asked me to be CEO and make it happen.  They requested I make the opening bid for compensation and equity.  I've not done start-ups before, since I've been at a variety of large high-tech firms all my career.  What is a good opening bid?  What are the right negotiating tactics thereafter?

<p>A 2012 compstudy extract can be found in <a href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/uploadedFiles/WilmerHale_Shared_Content/WilmerHale_Files/Events/Event/2012CompStudy_PPT_Tech.pdf" rel="nofollow">this presentation</a> </p>

<p>Relevant data for CEO:</p>

<ul>
<li>base - 187</li>
<li>bonus - 98</li>
</ul>

<p>current equity holdings: 31.7% (as % of diluted shares)</p>

<p>But remember to setup proper option pools, set asides for key hires, etc.  And make sure you understand what the KPIs are related to your actions (good and bad) &amp; set outcomes accordingly. </p>

What salary would you be excited with if you got it?  Start with that.
