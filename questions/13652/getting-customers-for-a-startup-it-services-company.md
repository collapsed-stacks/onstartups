I just started an IT Services company here in Chennai, India. I would like to know the different ways in which I can get clients so that I can grow my company. I have not yet started the recruitment, but before that, I need to get some customers. If you have any information, please let me know. My service offerings are:

1. Software Development (Web/Application)
2. Support and Maintenance
3. Consulting
4. Independent Verification & Validation (IVV)
5. Technical Writing
6. Copy Editing
7. Outsourcing

Thanks in advance.

Best Regards

Start with everyone you've worked with/for. All of my contract jobs have been found this way. 

You may have experience in all the areas you listed, but narrow your focus after you start getting a few customers. It may also help you keep your sanity.

You listed customers on your site, but your questions indicates you need customers before "recruitment". Do you mean, you have enough customers to keep you busy but not additional employees? 

Are you aware of any employees at existing customers who have moved on to other firms? They may be interested in working with you.

Review the news on companies in your area. If any of them have purchased another firm, they may need consulting to merge processes. Companies that have just received funding may be looking to expand their websites.

What does 'We qualify your business' mean?

Thanks for your reply. I have mentioned the list of customers whom I had worked with when I used to do freelancing. I do have contacts with them still, but they have very limited projects to offer now. Moreover, my contact point in those companies were only limited to one or two and I am in no position to identify a possible job change for the people there. As the company grows, I guess, we need to look for a wide range of customer base. 

As I am started my operations as a company in May, I have not started the recruitment activities. 

"We qualify your business" - As "adverb" qualifies a noun, "Aadverb Solutions" qualifies its customer with better IT solutions in a smarter way.

Once again, thank you so much for your response. If you have any more points to add, kindly let me know.

The first question you need to answer is what makes your company different from any of the many thousands of other companies. You have a generic web site with all the generic buzz words (I mean this to be helpful not to put you down).
 

Rather than offering everything under the sun, I would recommend that you specialize in one arena. Write a good plugin that solves a problem in one of the popular open source product, for instance, will get you exposure, potential customers, traffic to your site and enhanced page rank.  

Of course the challenge there is to first find the problem that a lot of people are trying to solve and then actually putting together the solution. It'll take time and effort.
The good news is that most of the competition that you're going to run into is not very good, so if your company has good skills, it'll be easy to rise to the top.
