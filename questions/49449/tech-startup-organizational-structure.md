We are in the process of launching a tech startup. I wonder if there's a good way to form a good organizational structure. I came up with the following, but I don't know if it sounds professional or is in line with what a small startup stands for. 

> CEO

> VP of Engineering

> VP of Marketing

> VP of Public Relations

> Software Engineer

If I understand correctly, then

 - you're just starting out and there are 5 people in the company
 - .... and **4 of those are VPs or CxO's?**

**That smells of amateurism.** You guys seem to be in this for the titles, not for the long schlepp of building a great company. And worse, you all seem to want to be Kings and have social status.

Giving people big titles at company formation is problematic. Later on, as the company grows, some people may not work out for the new and much increased demands placed on them. 

For example, your VP of Engineering might be good when it's a 10-man crew he manages, but at 30 engineers he's not working out as a manager. With the big titles he's already VP of Engineering, so there is no way to assign him another title or other duties without this clearly being a demotion. Public demotions are huge demotivators...

Aa a first idea, I'd suggest "Cofounder" for those who are that, and something relatively benign like "Senior Software Developer" etc for the rest.
