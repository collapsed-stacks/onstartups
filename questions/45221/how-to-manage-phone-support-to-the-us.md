We're a two-member team operating from Asia but incorporated in Delaware (for various reasons),  and we'll soon release our first webapp. Since the target audience of our app would be US and European users, we'll need to provide support during *their* daytime.

Ofcourse, when we can afford we'll setup an office and hire someone in the US, but for now we need an interim solution.

How can we manage phone support as a non-US startup? What do you do for it?

The best option is to get a 1800 number at grasshopper.com and foward your call to an outsourcing phone operator company. So, you can save money. You can use elance.com, freelancer.com, and odesk.com. I hope it helped!

Lots of options, but it would help if you could estimate your support case volume in terms of calls and emails. 

You may need to look into night shift early on, but you could also work on a hybrid plan with limited phone support (3-4 hours of US time) plus an awesome 24/7 support portal using something like zendesk or desk.com.
