I am looking to make a slide for my pitch that shows the size of private companies in my field  (wine distribution) and what they were acquired for, anyone know where I could find this information?

If they were privately held, it is going to be difficult to find it. I would try to contact wine associations but they will probably charge for that information. 

Did you try a wine group in LinkedIn? They may be able to give you more specific information.

Good luck.

You could find the information about acquisitions from the Bloomberg News sites.  if one of the sides is publicly listed it's much easier but if not you might have to scrape news stories on quite a few sites to get the information which in case of private-private deals may not even be published.

Bloomberg might cost you a pretty penny to get the information from too.
