It is not considered a good idea of naming a new company that has the same name as an inactive/ void company.  It is advisable to keep a new name for the company as customers with attractive company name might get easily attracted. This will ensure growth of the company.

I see two main concerns: 

 1. the image of the inactive company in the market;
 2. how aligned the inactive company is with the new company.

What I mean is, if the inactive company has a bad reputation, you'll suffer with it. Even if it does not have a bad reputation, it may be seen as "dead", and resurrection, well, that's God market! :D
Even if you do consider that not to be a problem, the new company will certainly have a new culture, a new direction, a new vision which may be different from the perception that others have/expect from the inactive company.

My advice: you have the possibility to have a fresh start, use it. No need to inherit other's stuff, unless it's exceptionally good...

In addition to the concerns raised above, you may run into trademark issues if you try to use a pre-existing name.

However, if this is important to you, consider consulting a trademark attorney.  It might be possible in some situations to obtain a trademark that has been abandoned.
