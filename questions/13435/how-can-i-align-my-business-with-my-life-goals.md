These things I am bothered by my business. You know, every one of us needs to make money. I decide to do it by creating my own business and preparing to do investment. I want to live around developed countries but I find that the current business I am doing is highly related to geographic location. I am an accompanying interpreter.I offer services for foreigners coming to my city(In China). I will do international trade business later. Gradually I will build get repeat customers and my business will prosper because of these repeat customers. However, if I relocate to another country later, this advantage will vanish and I need to build my customers from scratch and it will take me a lot of time. To live around developed countries is my life goal and I'm trying to coordinate my business plan with my life goal. If I can marry a woman who likes to live around the world, that's good, we can be a business couple.But what if I have a child? Then we can't take the child with us to live around different countries because he needs to receive school education. So please suggest, how can I perfectly align my business with my life goals?

You need to stop using words like "can't" and "will."  Neither of those are true, mostly.

Some people do have kids and move all around the world.  This can be bad for the kid, or wonderful, depending on what you do with the experience.

Some people enjoy traveling the world, some don't.  You can pick which one makes sense for you.  You can change your mind later.

Some locations are more lucrative for translators than others.  You can seek those places.

You could connect with a large, international company instead of building your own business so that you have a regular paycheck and don't have to worry about restarting with new customers.

You sound like you're closing every door around you, leaving you with nothing, when in fact you could be opening every door you find, exploring it, and finding many things worth attempting.

So, let me clear this out:

You have the delusion you will get rich by doing what a lot of other people do, too, successfully. Bad news: does not work.

Exactly. Commone sense dicates that.

Change your life goal. Your business ideas are not compativle with your life goal, and your business ideas are not flexible enough to ever be aligned to your life goal. So, your life goal has to change.

That simple.

Or get into some business that is actually feasible for your life goal. Neither normal international trade, now translating are. Actually trandlating is a relatigvely low income profession - sorry to say - with very limited earning potential.

<p>You're building an business as an intepreter, but eventually, you're not going to achieve the life/business goal unless you have a business where others do the interpreting. You need to learn how to find customers, hire and manage others to do the actual work. If you grow your business to a large enough size and level of profitability, you can go live and do what you want. The key will be can you get to the final level of managing managers.</p>
