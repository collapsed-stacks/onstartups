I have a SaaS platform site that will sell web-based software to other businesses.  Before I launch my website (or as I begin to receive subscription payments from customers who are potentially all over the country), does my LLC need to literally have business licenses in all 50 states?

Currently, I have my Federal ID/License and state licenses in the two states that I'm building my test markets.

**No**. 

You just need a business license *(or its equivalent)* in whatever locations you have a physical presence in. Pay attention to the sales tax laws in those states too. You only need to collect sales tax in those states you have a physical presence in and that require sales tax on what you do.

Note if you sell internationally, the EU **requires** you to collect VAT *(when due)* and remit that to the country you register your VAT presence in. This applies even if you are located in the US. *(Their laws are different from ours. How can they enforce this? They threaten to arrest the company principals if they go into an EU country. Much the same as we ban internet gambling and then arrest the heads of internet gambling companies when they visit the US.)*
