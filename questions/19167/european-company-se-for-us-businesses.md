<p>It's certainly "possible", but I don't know any smaller companies who uses that company form, and I would not consider using it myself.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Company_Statute" rel="nofollow">"Societas Europaea" (SE) is a European Union construct</a>, and in principle the idea is good. But <em>every</em> lawyer, accountant or any other professional I interact with knows the 'classic' country-specific company models by heart, but has at most worked on a handful SE companies.</p>

<p>And note, the SE company doesn't provide you with a legal presence in all EU countries. Your SE company is still domiciled in a single country. Your SE isn't getting easier taxation or anything like that, the SE needs to deal with multi nation tax issues just like any other multinational company does.</p>

<p>That said, there seems to be a trend that very large companies convert to the SE form; so clearly SE's are gradually getting more common. But for now, I would still pick the proven and well understood local forms -- AG, GmbH, A/S, SIA, Ltd, SA et cetera depending on where you choose to form your subsidiary.</p>
