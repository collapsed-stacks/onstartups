I've been through several rounds of technical (software developer) interviews at a start-up and have done pretty well. I've been invited back for the final round which will be with the CEO. I understand it will also be under NDA which will allow them to talk more about their plans, etc.

What sorts of questions should I ask?

Things I already know:

 - there will be options granted immediately (but not vesting for 3 years)
 - the company has been going for about 3/4 months and is close to delivering their first (software) product
 - I will be approximately the 4th software developer on board
 - the company is pushing for second round funding
 - they have a clear 5-year exit plan (although I don't know any more detail than that - they talk about "sitting on a beach" in 5 years)

I'd be interested to find out more about the exit plan and whether I will be "part of it". I'm also interested in how future funding plans will affect my options. But I'm not really a business guy, so I'm not sure what the right questions to ask are, or how to ask them without seeming rude!

Oh, and it's UK-based if that helps shape the answers.

Thanks!

Working for a startup, can be a very different experience compared to a well established company. Aside from the sort of questions you might expect about the compensation package, you should probably talk about the people, the work ethic/expectations, the culture they wish to build. 

Additionally, talk a lot about the product, and about the "why" in the vision. If you're not excited by both, you should seriously consider whether this is the company for you.

Ask about the other roles needed to make this Startup a success, how will they get the product to market? If they don't have a clear strategy, be worried.

While talking about the details of the business, find out how much runway they have (how long can they survive until bankrupt). Fund raising takes time and energy and is rarely as smooth as you'd hope.

Usually, when you are talking to the CEO, at that point all the compensation and funding questions should have been asked earlier in the process. This is something head of engineering should have used to sell you on the position.
What I usually focus on when interviewing the CEO (yes, you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you) is long term vision and then dive deep into company culture questions.

Some things come to mind immediately.

3/4 months old and pushing for second round already?  How much was first raise?  From credit cards / family friends? What is the amount of the second round - and who is leading (existing investors, or completely new) 

Customer traction: they are just going to launch the product? How well do they know (validated know - not just a guess) what their target market wants?  How large of a market is it?

Without good answers to these, the CEO might be sitting on the beach much earlier than 5 years (but likely not a Caribbean one).
