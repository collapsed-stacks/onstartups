I am starting an ecommerce marketplace of local vendors. one of my sources of revenue will be lead generation, however I am pretty undecided on how much to charge vendors for every lead I would provide to them. could anyone help me with regards to calculation of fees for leads?

It really depends on how much information a lead includes and how well the advertiser (lead buyer) will be able to convert the leads on his side.

Here are some data points for you:

 - Email + Zip for Groupon/Living Social - $2 per lead
 - Email + Zip for Job Related - $1 per lead 
 - Email + Zip for Other things - $1-$1.5 CPL
 - First page (5 fields) with giveaway incentive - $1
 - First page for Insurance - $5-$10 (depending on insurance type)
 - 2 Page credit card application - $20 CPL
 - 2 page short term loan application - $20 CPL
 - 2 page Online education application - $20 per lead
