I am a Chinese guy with a bachelor's degree, unmarried. I want to go abroad to live in US, Japan and France for some years. In the meantime I want to build my own business. I don't want to work for others. I also want to learn Japanese, especially oral Japanese. I can read and write some Japanese now. I don't have much money at present. How can I integrate these goals? Any feasible ideas?

I have a similar desire to travel through asia while maintaining a online business through my laptop, so I wish you every success. I also want to learn Japanese.

Here are some things you can think about:
* You can speak Chinese and understand its culture. This allows you to provide services to those from other countries who want to do business with China.
* China manufactures alot of goods. What can you do to take advantage of this?

You may want to come to the USA on a student visa.  If you come on a work visa, your time will be so dedicated to the business that hires you that you will not likely have time to build a business.

You dont have to be an american citizen to open a business here.  As a student visa you cannot really work for others, so you will need a way to support yourself.  You can work with the permission of your school, which is hard to get (unless if you work at the school)

So maybe, you can get a student visa to come here and study Japanese. 
Once you are here, start your own business.
The USA is one of the best places for anyone to start a business, you will greatly appreciate this coming from the political and feudal nature of doing business in China.

The only issue you will run into is $$$$.
Its expensive to live and study here, and starting a business can take a few $$$.
Maybe, if your ideas and talents are good enough you can find someone to sponsor you or take you on as a partner.


Dont give up on your dreams.
Every problem is just a challenge to be solved..!!!!

You have the right idea man.  This is what being an entrepreneur is all about.  Designing a future and then taking a shot at it.  Just so happens that a business is the best vehicle to integrate these goals. 

My quick assessment recommendation for you is to create a Japanese language training business. 

You want to improve and learn more Japanese right?  The best way to learn something, I believe, is to teach it - because it forces you to completely absorb and disseminate information in an elevated context (in other words, if you have to teach this stuff you'll be more tuned into the material).  

The model for your training business could be based on three pillars. 1) Free information (websites, articles on Japanese language) to attract customers (volume).  2) Products (eBooks, Video courses) to sell and earn a consistent revenue. 3) Personal training and seminars... so you can make even more money AND travel the world teaching Japanese!   

Goodluck.
