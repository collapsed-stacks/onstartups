<p>Car / Lift / Ride Sharing websites are all over the net these days, and they all seem to be offering free registration, free searching, and free information on those offering rides. (e.g. <a href="http://www.blablacar.com/" rel="nofollow">BlaBlaCar</a>)</p>

<p>Am I not correct in thinking that these website's major asset is their data store of people willing to share rides from location A to location B?</p>

<p>Yet, they offer this information up for free to anyone who registers!</p>

<p>How do such websites make their money?</p>

<p>Any enlightenment on the matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>They likely do make some money off of advertising on their webpage but a strong portion of their profits come from service fees because they allow the drivers to charge for the seats in their vehicles. </p>

<p>If they charge a 5% fee on what the drivers charge:
[Since 2009]</p>

<p>$27 x 5% x 8,000,000 = $10,800,000.</p>

<p>If they charge a 10% fee on the drivers then it would be $21,600,000.</p>
