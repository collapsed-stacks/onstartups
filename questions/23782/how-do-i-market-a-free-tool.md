Greetings,
Recently, I decided to delve into the world of internet marketing and advertising with a little experiment.  It started when I wrote a spreadsheet to prototype stock market screening methods for a C++ project.  In the process the spreadsheet became a useful tool - maybe other people will find it useful too.  So I thought: what the heck, I'll put it up on a blog, and add some adsense adds.  If it generates enough revenue to buy a domain name I'll be happy.

I've also written a few silly little articles about subjects that I've been playing around with lately.  These articles are really for my own entertainment; it's the spreadsheet that I think people will find useful.

I've done the usual social bookmarking and directory submission stuff, but so far those efforts have been fruitless.

The spreadsheet performs simple stock valuation and analysis. It's located in the Google cloud, and free to use with a Google account.

To answer you question: To become a popular some tool first have to be useful. To be useful it have to be complete product:

- easy to install
- full functionality
- comprehensive documentation
- support
- continuing development reflecting the users requirement.

Have you received some feedback from users?

Have you tied to include you program in a sites that collect a list of useful tools for analyzing investments? I have seen a plenty of them promoting different type of simple and more complex calculations. Have you considered registering separate domain name specifically for you product with well written landing page and appropriate screenshots etc.

Advertising free product does not mean it have to use different methods then advertising non free one.

<p>The previous answers are alluding to something deeper: that is, how committed are you actually pursuing this as a business? Taking the steps and "changing the mindset" as Ross and Ron suggest would demonstrate your commitment. It isn't easy to get something worthwhile going. It's hard work and may take a long time before you get traction. </p>

<p>Here is dharmesh's <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/9008/Startup-Marketing-Tactical-Tips-From-The-Trenches.aspx" rel="nofollow">advice</a> on initial marketing steps for a startup. One thing that he notes in his thoughts about Linkedin is that you have to be part of the community. Your disposition is not to sell something but to make yourself more useful to others. Over time, this will help bring awareness to you and your product. </p>

<p>It sounds like your idea would be useful to <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/" rel="nofollow">seekingalpha.com</a> users. I am sure you have already thought of this but that is probably the best community of users for your tool. </p>

**Mindset change required**. Have you noticed you spoke about your free tool, but no link, no real lead for me to find it or use it. You have to think like a marketing guy too, not just a programmer.
