Ok basically I have good ideas for both but i just need to know where to start. which market is less harsh/competitive and easier to step into and learn the ropes between the two( I know none are easy). I want to start with one where I have a chance of success.

Please not this is an actual startup im planning here, im not just trying to develop something and hope it booms.

Assuming you're done all the right research and you have your idea for product in a market that's hungry... it won't matter where you start.

However, I would recommend to try the market with the fastest "feedback loop" - Where can you do the least amount of work to build a prototype / pilot and get results in the fastest time to know if you're in the right market?

Ensure you build into your product tracking mechanisms... What you're actually trying to do is build a money making machine ... pour $100 into marketing and Get $2000 in sales. You will ONLY know that with proper tracking in place.

Whichever you are more passionate about and enjoy coding more. 

Your decision of web app vs mobile app won't be the thing that decides if you are successful or not. Your success will be based on execution and to a smaller degree your idea.

There are many frameworks that exist now that let you create web-based apps that are viewable in a browser on a computer or mobile phone. Some frameworks will let you port your existing web apps into packaged Android or iOS apps that users download and install the traditional way.

This would let you deploy an application across several platforms with much less difficulty than making individual apps for each one, although still more complex than targeting a single platform.

I would suggest getting into Blackberry or Windows Development, as they are new and less competitive.
