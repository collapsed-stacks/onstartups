I will register all six names (.com, .net, .org) for both my company and my product. At the present, all six will reddirect to ONE of them, but I am not sure which domain should be my main, where I will apply all the SEO. 

Long term wise (2-3+ years) there might be another product, and therefore company domain name looks better to buid on. 

On the other hand, short term wise, putting site with my product name in focus, looks better for selling/marketing  *that one product* and building all the SEO around it to achieve higher possible PR.

So, what is your experience? Which one sells better? Product name domain or Company name domain? 

Thanks in advance for your time and efforts to express your experience.

You should definitely do both, here are my thoughts:


 - You need a product site

Your product should be easy to find and should ideally be "ProductName.com"  This is much better for SEO purposes, which is critical to your success.

 - Your company site can be simple

All you really need is an address, portfolio, about and contact page.  I would make sure to link to "ProdcutName.com" as well.  Link Building is essential to SEO, and SEO is crucial.

 - SEO is not a zero sum game.  If you utilize the proper techniques on BOTH your Product and Company pages will be better off since you can actually link them to each other!

Good Luck!

I will go for the domain with product name. When I create new product i register 2-3 domain names with product keywords in them and link them from the company web page. 

Focus is important here. Tell Google that this site is focused around some niche.

- domain name (keywords)

- keywords in texts on site 

- keywords in anchor text of inbound links.

All this have to be focused around particular niche. You can't seat on two chairs at the same time.

I have very limited experience in this, so take my advice for what it’s worth. I’m actually in the process of working on this myself. Here’s my take on it:

We’re going to register both mycompanyname.com and myproductname.com (as you have indicated you plan on doing). Our plan is to focus on the mycompanyname.com website and redirect the myproductname.com page to mycompanyname.com/products page. Our reasoning for this is:

 1. Although we’re starting off with one product, we plan on releasing other products in the future. Focusing our energy on the mycompanyname.com site will reduce our work in the long run. If we already have the base site completed and optimized, when the second product comes out, all we’ll have to do is focus on the new product’s page(s). We’ll register the myproductname.com domain for the second product and redirect it to the mycompanyname.com/products page.
 2. We plan on marketing our company brand and developing product names around that brand. So if we focus on branding the company, then it makes sense for us to focus our efforts on the mycompanyname.com site because that’s what people will know.

If others think I’m way off on this, please feel free to jump in.
