Does anybody know a good terms of service generator? I need one that, besides inserting company name and etc, will outline my and my customers' rights so I don't have to read the whole thing. I'm only 15 but starting a good web design company, mostly as a hobby with a few of my friends. I don't want to be or have to the time to deal with legal jargon, so I can't really make one myself. Thanks!

Wordpress.com makes their Terms of Service available under a Creative Commons license. It's a clear, well-written, legally useful document that should have a lot in common with the needs of any web app.

You mentioned starting a web design company, though. You may be looking for a design contract, not a terms of service. The AIGA provides a standard form for design services you might find useful.

Keep in mind that if you're charging people money for a service, it's not a hobby. If you don't take it seriously, you're really risking getting sued and winding up in a really crappy situation, no matter how old you are.
