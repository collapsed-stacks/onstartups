Am in the process of getting quotes on an idea and am negotiating with a web dev/design shop about the possibility of giving them some equity. They are willing to slash the total project cost from 6k to 5k.

So my question is... do I offer them 1-3%?
Do I suck it up and pony up the extra $1000?
What is a fair % to offer for a $1000 price reduction?
Is it even worth it to dish out the equity?

Better yet: pay them $5K, no stocks. They are willing to do the work for $5K, so take them up on the offer. They'll complain and they'll give in.

I would never give equity for something like this, especially for a thousand bucks.

Pay them full price and expense the amount.

Keep your business for yourself. Give equity only to investors or key employees.

If you **must** give away some equity (e.g. for lack-of-cash reasons), consider limiting the potential upside.

e.g. For reducing the price by $x we will give you $5x when/if our sales / profit reach $Y.

This gives them a reasonable return for the chance they are taking, but not an unreasonable return if you become the next Google / Microsoft / IBM.

Remember, what you are doing now may not be what you are doing in 5 years time. 

So another approach might be to limit the percentage to the part of the business related to the work they are doing. (e.g. x% of website sales less direct expenses) If the website does well, they do well; if it does badly and your company ends up selling fast food instead, you don't end up paying a percentage on each burger sold.
