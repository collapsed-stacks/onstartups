How do I find a sales person?

I know a lot of people here think that you just put up Google Ads, wait for clicks, and then wait for sales, but I think sales is an important task. Following up with potential clients after they get a free trial, solving their problems, etc. Especially with a relatively small niche, very vertical, and B2B, I think sales is extremely important.

I do it all myself right now, which is fine because I am the founder of the company and I know the product inside and out, but I don't feel like I am born salesperson. Plus, I am running short of hours in the day.

Say I wanted to find a sales person in my area.. where would I look? Would a salesperson want to work on straight commission to start? Or maybe some kind of trial basis?

This is an interesting project and socially conscious, so there may be people willing to take a bit of a pay cut to work in this niche. Though I think a good salesman could do very well with the business because there are no direct competitors.

This is a SaaS so there is only a small upfront sale and then a continuing long term, per-month charge for customers. How do you structure a commission arrangement for this sort of business?

So, in summary:
-how to find a salesperson?
-how do I pay a salesperson?

If I were to change anything about our business (started in 2003) it would be to hire a full-time salesperson right from the start.  In our business (non-medical in-home care for Seniors and professional advice for their families), referrals from other professionals are the key to driving sales, especially at first.  Having a good website helps us also, but if we had hired a salesperson in 2003 instead of 2009, I speculate that our revenues would be as LEAST two to three times what they are now, and probably more.

In our case, when we did finally decide to hire, we sent out emails to hundreds of local and not-so-local people that we know in the business, telling them what we wanted to do and asking them to refer prospective salespeople to us.  Ultimately, one of those referrals worked out and now we have a terrific salesperson working for us.  

Just since last fall when she started, our revenues are up over 66% and a good part of that is due to her work (with the balance attributable to our website generating inquiries plus our own clients referring other new clients to us).

In our case, we pay the salesperson a fixed base salary.  Eventually, we want to have her on a part base, part bonus structure.  That will be tricky to do, though, because we want her to be motivated to support the efforts of everyone in the office, and everyone in the office supports sales coming from all sources, not just her.  In a small company, she wears a few other hats part of the time and so we need to make sure that we don't want to make her think that we will pay her extra to do something that is dysfunctional for everyone else.  

Good luck!

I guess the answer to your question...
**How do I find a sales person?**
There are a  number of routes to find talent,identifying someone who has personality, drive , hunger to succeed and willing to develop and learn, are what some class as core competencies, though in your mind you know what person you want for your business and as a result will enable your findings to drive your product forward ad build you company and product..
If they can  believe in your product and understand your clients needs you are halfway there.

**Say I wanted to find a sales person in my area.. where would I look?**
firstly where are you based? you will need someone who is within a 10mile radius to ensure they don't have to travel too far to work, visiting clients and companies is a different subject. Is your business based at your own Office, rented offices ,home office?

 **Would a salesperson want to work on straight commission to start?**
That would depend on what skills and relationship they have as with experience in order to get deals in quickly,Many sales people have order books or contacts in their markets where by they can  close business very quickly and stream line the sales cycle, many work commission only or a fixed fee for a project, with the rewards being greater than a basic annual salary with bonuses.offer a contract to perm offer could be a good option and give the sales person the feeling of ownership and self worth, instead of interim contract that will allow the sales person to move after the time developing relationships and understand the strengths and weakness of your brand and product.

**maybe some kind of trial basis?**
1 month to 3 month trail is best, I would suggest that they present a business plan ,, 30/60/90 day plan on how they are to build and develop business, this will give you the confidence that they are able to focus , manage their time effectively and be on track to sell and be profitable allowing you to expand the business and grow.

**How do you structure a commission arrangement for this sort of business?**
You will need to devise  and structure of some sort of commission plan, this can be discussed with the sales person regarding targets , mile stones , the cost of the product and what the client is paying, as a business you need to ensure your bottom line is covered as with your operating costs and though you will also need to ensure that all the products and services that have been sold are invoiced and paid within the terms agreed with sales person and client, resulting cash in the bank before the payment is given to the sale person.

If you struggle to find or need support, Google me "Steve Headhunter Turner"  i can hopefully point Talent in your direction for a fixed or small introduction fee.
Good luck and all the best, kind regards
ST

No great salesperson is going to work for you unless they can make a lot of money.  Salespeople are not naturally the type who will take great risk unless there is great reward.  Entrepreneurs are different, they will do something because they think it is "right" or something they are passionate about.

My suggestion is to keep doing it yourself until you can offer more money or get a business-oriented co-founder whose can take the sales role from you.

If the pass the test of muster (which you carefully construct and go through with them), once you've hired them, I would still set up some tests to make sure that they're following your guidelines and expectations in the field (maybe throw them some leads who are friends of yours, and get an assessment of how they did).  I think it's within reason - you need to see how they're doing in the field so you can get your ROI, and you have to make sure that they're representing your service with a proper and professional full work week.  I'll give it four p's - presentation, preparation, professionalism and being proactive.  The right person will be doing these things consistently.
