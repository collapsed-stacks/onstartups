Groupon has been hiring sales people like crazy.  Their turnover is probably very high but the sheer number of salespeople that they are adding to their company every month is something crazy to a small startup person like me.  What kind of commission plan are they using to attract all of these salespeople?

Per a former Groupon Salesman who just jumped ship an joined a Boston based competitor....

They get a $36,000 base with a 2% to 3% commission on deals they close.  Up to this point, salesmen in larger markets can do quite well.  Salesmen in smaller markets have a tough time.

Rumor has it, they have sweetened the commission structure slightly just recently to keep sales growing into the rumored IPO.

It does not matter.  

Salespeople are jumping to the opportunity of selling. Everyone now, wants to do Groupon.  The real question is, until when Groupon will be the next hot thing, then salespeople will stop being attracted. 

I will guess that they are using a variant of the normal sales commission method.
