Hey guys. Im looking into creating a facebook applications. Do you guys know if we still have the option of choosing where and how we want to dock the application? I heard that it might have been changed when the update came through.

<p>I'm not really clear on what you mean by docking a facebook app. As of now you can have your application on its own page in facebook (canvas page), on your app's users' profiles as profile tab, and on the users' profiles as a profile box. Profile boxes are to be depreciated soon, according to the facebook <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Developer_Roadmap" rel="nofollow">developer roadmap</a>. </p>
