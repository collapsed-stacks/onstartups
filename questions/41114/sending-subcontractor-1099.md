If a contractor hires a subcontractor (including them in the contract) for a job, what are the contractor's tax obligations?

If I understand it correctly, all that the contractor has to do is write the subcontractor's pay off as an expense and send them a 1099 form at the end of the year.

Thank you!

Unless the subcontractor ends up being classified as your employee by the IRS, that is.... You should have a tax adviser to go with you on the details of the activity.

But generally speaking - yes, you're right. Just be aware that there might be some pitfalls you'd want to avoid.
