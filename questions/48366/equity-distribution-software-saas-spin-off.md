I have been working in a consulting agency for a couple of years. Besides my standard job responsibilities, I was accountable for the technology. Some years ago we developed a software, for internal use, that facilitated our daily work. We upgraded this software and saw commercial potential. I was in charge of the development of improving the software and further developing it to be ready for commercialization. The entire consulting team put in time and effort to make this a success. Now we plan to create a spin-off entity to commercialize the software, that is ready to market. In this new entity I will take the role of CEO.
The source code is property of the consulting company, that covered the development costs. Since I have a technical background, I do not have experience on the division of equity (of NewCo) and the valuation of the software (n.b. not patent protected).

My questions:

 - How is the software valued? At cost (approx. 400k) or at potential future income it might generate?
 - On what basis should the equity be divided? Do I have a legit claim
   on an equity stake, since I contributed to large extent of the
   development and potential success of the software? Will the majority of the shares directly go to the shareholders of the consulting company or to the consulting company itself?

Thank you in advance,

Kind regards

I suggest that the spin off be wholly owned by the current company.  Anything else gets complicated and harder to justify.

Valuation tends to have a lot of hocus pocus but the two bases you suggest are commonly used in the industry.  You need a good accountant for this.
