<p>I'm currently working on a project, which is a self hosted web app. It's a project management tool built on wordpress. It's for small businesses, so enterprise is not a target market. I'm selling it through a theme shop. Billing, administration, purchases, payments are handled by the shop.</p>

<p>I'm thinking on to move/expand it as an saas product, to make it easier to use. (Maybe rewrite it on a different platform in this case). </p>

<p>Are self hosted solutions still popular to build a business upon or should I thininkg about the move? 
Can saas business model handeld by myself in the beginning?</p>
