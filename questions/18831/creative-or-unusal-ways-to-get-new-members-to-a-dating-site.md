I have a dating site that's been live for several months now and more users have come in through my Google AdWords campaigns. I'm trying to find a way push the growth a little faster without spending a ton of money. 

Anyone out there with experience getting new members to join your dating site without paying a fortune on ads? 

Really appreciate any advice. 

Thanks!

Try some of these ideas...

 - Start a controversy... nothing brings people to a website faster than a good controversy. This is the staple of GoDaddy's marketing strategy.

 - Viral tricks... encourage your users to tweet or share your site. Offer rewards for 5 or more referals for example.

 - Affiliate programs... sign up with www.cj.com or similar and start an affiliate program.

 - SEO... really beef up your SEO (search engine optimization efforts). You probably can't focus on the big terms like "online dating" so go for longtail searches like "find a date online".

 - Press... reach out to the press. Send emails directly to blog authors and offer them an exclusive. Don't just pitch stories about your company, offer scoops on ideas related to your company.

 - Offline events... have parties/events in your local area.
