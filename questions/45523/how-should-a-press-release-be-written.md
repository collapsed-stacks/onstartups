I uploaded my brand new physics 2D game to the playstore a few days ago, and have had a substantial amount of downloads per day so far. I think it has great potential and people like that kind of game.

As of now, I have tried the following marketing techniques:

 - Posted my game on specialized Android forums asking for feedback. (It's free to do so, people are honest and give constructive criticism + it increases my SEO.)

 - Uploaded my game on parallel markets: AndroidPit and Amazon (under
   review).

 - Contacted 40 specialized review websites. (Surprisingly, none of them reviewed my game, but 3 other websites did really nice reviews. This must have been due to word of mouth.)

Unfortunately, at the moment, I have no visibility in the playstore. I can't be found in the top grossing or top new category.

I have written a press release (In French and English), which is ready to be sent to the press. The question is, **who should it be written on behalf of? Me, or an anonymous third person?**

<blockquote>
  <p>Press releases should not be written in a first person language (I,
