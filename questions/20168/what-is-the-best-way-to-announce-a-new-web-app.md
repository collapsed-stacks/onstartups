What services do people use to announce their new projects aside from Twitter and Facebook?  Specifically, if you don't have a popular, established site of your own to announce from.  I've used one site (which I won't mention) to make an announcement, but I'm wondering if there are other good ones I don't know about.

<p>I just launched a start-up and we are now in the process of drawing visibility. </p>

<p>A good idea is to be featured on start-up directories. Here's a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Killerstartups</li>
<li>Crunchbase</li>
<li>Go2Web2.0 </li>
<li>Vator.tv</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these drive good traffic to your website. Killerstartups was particularly good for us. Of course the followers of these platforms are people in the start-up world, and not necessarily your target group. Still, you will get seen, and harvest some useful SEO goodness.</p>

I previously got very heavy traffic from programming.reddit.com, but seem to be more picky about shameless plugs than they used to.
