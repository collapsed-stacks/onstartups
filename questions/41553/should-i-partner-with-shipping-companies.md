I am Starting an E-commerce marketplace , my website is under the design process as of now,  at this stage should I approach shipping companies asking them to partner with us to provide fulfillment services for our vendors , or should I wait till the website is  completed and live ?  

Also can you give me some tips as to how I can bargain with them for better rates for fulfillment  services?


Thanks!

It is better to wait till your site will be ready . But for you not to waist time, you can create the list of potential shipping companies, that might be interested in cooperation with you.
