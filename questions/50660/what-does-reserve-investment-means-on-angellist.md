I have seen reserve button on [AngelList][1] while making any investment in start ups. What does it means?  Are such online investments safe?
Does all the investors (small/big) get share for their investment in startups?

<p>I believe it means you can 'reserve your spot in the list'. It doesn't guarantee that you will get all the shares you reserve (if they are oversold, etc).</p>

<p>Online investments are generally not very safe. AngelList investments should be safer, because you have validation in terms of seeing investors or other people you know/may have heard of telling you they like the company/are investing as well. However, AngelList investments are still overwhelmingly like to fail, meaning you should practice <a href="http://blog.venturelynx.com/2013/08/10/a-tip-for-angel-investors/" rel="nofollow">good diversification</a>.</p>

<p>In general, all investors will have rights to share certificates, and will get a number of shares proportional to their investment. It is up to the startup to take care of all this.</p>
