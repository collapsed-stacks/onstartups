There are 5 other members in the startup and they work in different locations. We are looking for online meeting software suitable for **a small distributed workforce**. It has to support at least voice chat and screen sharing.

Which online meeting software do you recommend?

How about Google+ Hangout.
We use it in many occasion for user group meetups.

It's free. It supports screen sharing. You can add up GoogleTalk messenger as well.

Stick with the basics: Skype for voice chat and Join.me for screen sharing.

<p>We usually use <a href="http://www.skype.com" rel="nofollow"><strong>Skype</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/hu/index.aspx" rel="nofollow"><strong>Teamviewer</strong></a> - skype for the voice chat, and with Teamviewer you can even share screens for free!</p>

buzzumi.com is audio and video chat in the browser and you can share pdfs and youtube videos.
