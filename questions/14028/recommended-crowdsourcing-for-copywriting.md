Can anyone recommend a good crowdsourcing service for copywriting? I would prefer if the members are English native speakers.

Cheers.

You can find copywriters on TaskArmy.com, TextBroker.com or Elance.com, depending on the quality you are looking for. TextBroker is the only crowsourcing copywriting website I know, the other ones are outsourcing websites.
