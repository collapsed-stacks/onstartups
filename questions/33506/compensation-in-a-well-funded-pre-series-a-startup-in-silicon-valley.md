I have had a favorable (and rigorous) interview process at a pre-series A startup (12 months old) that has a solid product, a very good team and excellent market traction. They have raised around $2.5M in seed funding from top-notch investors. They are looking to raise their series A some time next year and have already attracted customers from 40+ cities in CA.

The company has challenging technical problems that a team of 5 developers are working on at the moment. They are looking to hire two more developers to take the count to 7 developers.

I have a Masters degree in a related field and 6+ years of software development experience at MNCs with a good track record. My motivation to work for a startup is to gain a significant amount of experience in building scalable products while also understanding the business-side of things (that I can use to hopefully launch a startup someday). I don't want to sound outrageous with my salary/equity expectations but also want to ensure I get a fair deal.

Any suggestions on what salary/equity I should expect?

Remember, that reward is related to risk. They have risked a lot to get here. They already have good funding (even though the cash could be running out) and they don't need to give you a significant chunk of equity.
