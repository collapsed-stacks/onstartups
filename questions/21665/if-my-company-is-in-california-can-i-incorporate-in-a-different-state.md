I've heard that most US corporations are in Delaware or Nevada because they are the friendliest to corporations.

I don't have an office or anything, but I'm looking to start an internet based business that would be run from my home office and would just have a PO Box somewhere.  Can I incorporate in Nevada?

<p>This type of Q comes up frequently, reflecting the urban-legend status of forming entities in DE and NV.</p>

<p>Short answer: You can, but you probably shouldn't.</p>

<p>Slightly longer answer: You probably should incorporate in CA because if you incorporate elsewhere but do business in CA, you will need to register in CA, too - meaning higher startup costs and paying two states' annual franchise taxes.</p>

<p>This issue is discussed in the following posts:</p>

You definitely can incorporate in Delaware even if you are located in California.  Delaware does not require a physical presence and generally has the most pro corporate laws.

Dana's comments do not apply to most web or internet business.   YOUR INTERNET BUSINESS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN NEVADA!!!!! HERE IS WHY!

 1. The INC Fees are lower
 2. There is very low annual fees versus the CA 800 year
 3. There is no state income tax, so you could have dual residency and lower your tax burden
 4. IMPORTANT! Once you grow, chances are you will realize that you can hire less expensive employees in Las Vegas vs San Francisco.  The cost of living is lower, so a customer service rep earning $14 per hour in Vegas sees that as a lot more than someone living in San Jose, LA, or any other real city in california 

Its very easy to setup shop in vegas, but live in california.  Worst case is that you have to pay state income tax on 100% of your income, but you leave room to reduce that amount easily with dual residency, or just by being a Nevada resident all together. 

Cost of living in NEVADA is a bargain.  I am surprised more entrepreneurs dont take advantage of it. 

If you plan on ever having employees, or dont like paying to much in taxes consider Nevada & Wyoming.  Nevada is your safer bet, because it offers low cost of living and still a lifestyle that is acceptable (specially in vegas)
