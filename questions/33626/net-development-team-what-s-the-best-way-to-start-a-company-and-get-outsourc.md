We are a .net development team in India, and we are looking for outsourcing work. But how to get such work, and how to represent in the market of software development? How should we approach clients and establish trust with out any work history? Any suggestion would be great and helpful.

> How should we approach clients and establish trust with out any work history? 

Simple: don't. Get a job. Get a profile, get a name, get a work history.

There are ton of bad consultants around. Why should I hire one who does not even have any work history? You sound more like someone who should get a job as a programming trainee, instead of opening a consulting company.
