Here in Tanzania it seems that education is becoming less and less important.  So I decided to design a "READ for SUCCESS" project which will convince people to back college/school and to motivate them to read as Ben Carson did.  My problem is that I don't have any books or enough money to manage this project.  My question is how can I get a sponsor my my project?

You can try to crowdfund your project.

For example you can open a project here:

 - http://www.kickstarter.com
 - http://www.indiegogo.com

And ask for funding. Make sure you make your cause clear. In addition some people expect "rewards" for their money. You could for example send photos of your pupils who are benefiting of the newly bought books. If somebody spends more money he might get a painting from a kid or something like that.
