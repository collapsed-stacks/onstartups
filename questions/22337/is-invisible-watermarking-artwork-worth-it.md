I'm thinking of creating a web service that is heavily based on unique artwork (pictures, maybe short animations). 

Does it make sense to watermark them invisibly? Will watermarking help me in court if rivals copy the artwork blindly? Will it be beneficial for PR?

In court?  Really?  I find it unlikely that this would every be worth pursuing to the extent of involving courts and lawyers. 

Without more context it's hard to say what value watermarking files would have in your case. It might make more sense to have a visible watermark to discourage copying in the first place.
