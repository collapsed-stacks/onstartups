In order for an entity to go after you personally, they must "pierce the corporate veil".  The laws are different in different states, but the main reasons are:  

 1. Was it a real company, with actual shareholder meetings and filings?
 2. Is the company more of a conduit for making money than a company?
 3. Were the company's assets used for personal use or commingled with the owners?

Also, if fraud is involved, then they can go after you personally.  

If #1-3 are your concern, talk to a business lawyer.  They can help you take the basic measures.  No one wants to lose their house b/c their business royally messed up.

Corporations protect assets (i.e. money, your first example) but not crimes (your second example).

You are correct that individuals are not responsible for paying back corporate debt.  However it's rare nowadays for banks to loan money to new corporations for exactly this reason; typically your house goes up for collateral.  So don't get any ideas.  :-)

In a typical lawsuit *both* the company *and* the individuals are sued.

<p>The post <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/06/12/beware-your-alter-ego/" rel="nofollow">Beware Your Alter Ego</a> provides an overview of the circumstances under which a shareholder-founder will be protected against personal liability for corporate obligations.</p>

<p>The situation for directors and officers is quite different, in that they owe a fiduciary obligation to the corporation (though, often, the corporation - if it is in a position to do so - will indemnify them against liability resulting from good-faith performance of their duties).</p>

<p>This it a potentially complicated subject; you should consider retaining an attorney to advise you in light of the facts of your particular situation.</p>
