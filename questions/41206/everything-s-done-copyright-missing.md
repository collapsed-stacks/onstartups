I'm working on my startup for 1 year and a half and it is ready to go to production.


I don't have investors and I don't want it right now, I'm planning to get volume before meeting my VC contacts. 

I don't have copyright of this, Should I register it before going to production?

How to start it? do I need a lawyer to start the process? can I do this myself?

thanks in advance

You do have copyright, on that which can be copyrighted -- it's automatic (in all countries that have signed the Berne Convention, which is nearly all of them). Note, however, that you can't copyright ideas or processes -- you need to look at patents for those. And that will need a specialist lawyer.
