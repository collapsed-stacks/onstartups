I know I could buy a template and modify it but about how much would it cost to hire someone on elance.com to build an auction site that has a merchant account built in so users can pay with credit card directly and deposit into their bank account without using a third party such as paypal?

<p>Many will say - your results may vary.  </p>

<p>I would start off understanding <em>what</em> type of auction software would meet your needs and then work towards customizing it to suit your visual / process needs.</p>

<p>A good example of a simple php auction script can be found <a href="http://www.phpprobid.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Then, you can look for specific experience on a specific application and see what they have done before awarding your business to them.</p>

<p>Of course, my customized business process j2ee b2b reverse auction effort cost north of $400K to build &amp; launch - but that's a different time and story. ;)</p>

Be careful hiring offshore for anything too complex. 
Auction sites in particular can be very involved depending on the level of user activity and type of auction. Make sure you have very clearly defined requirements before going too far into the process. 

Maybe try a requirements service like www.ezrequirements.com

<p>This may be offtopic, but:</p>

<p>Make sure to research your payment plans carefully. If you're planning to user your own merchant account to collect money for someone else (sellers on your auction), you may be <a href="http://www.merchantaccountblog.com/140/factoring-credit-card-laundering" rel="nofollow">factoring</a>. Just wanted to make sure you're aware of this before you invest in the code and everything else.</p>
