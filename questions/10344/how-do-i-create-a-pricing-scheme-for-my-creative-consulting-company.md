My company consults companies on creating websites, branding, online video promotions, and mobile apps. One aspect of our service is the consulting side, the other is project management, finding the means to complete the design/development project. I'm having a lot of trouble with creating a pricing scheme that isn't hourly and doesn't leave clients in the unknown about what they will end up paying. Any suggestions on how to calculate these prices so I can maintain profit from the work I deliver?

Be careful.

Fixed price is great for customers but you are running a consultancy not a product shop.

Even though you might do the same work, you should charge depending on how much your work is worth to your customer. In other words. You should charge Nike more than Unknown Startup X.

Not just because it's Nike but because the logo matters more to Nike than to a lesser known company. In other words your delivery will be much more critical.

Also sometimes time&material is the way forward especially if your the work you do is sporadic. You want to be flexible and responsive but the client should pay for that as it will affect your ability to book resources.

My advice having run a consultancy for 5 years and having been 15 years in the business is this.

1. Create a set of "of the shell" products where you can predict almost exactly how much time you will spend on it. This could be an expert review, setting up google adwords, reskinning a wordpress blog. Setting up a youTube channel. Publishing videos to all the relevant social media spaces. The price will always be fixed and it's your job to then figure out how you can optimize it so that it cost you close to nothing. (for instance can you optimize the publishing process)

2. Establish 2-3 price ranges depending on the size of the companies you are going to consult. You want to charge larger companies more because of the risk involved in being in business with large companies. 

3. Always put 20% on top of that as a buffer

Now in order to get the right pricing in you will need to do the following.

A. Get briefed by the client on the overall goal of the project.
B. Create a debrief of that meeting making sure you have covered as much as possible.
C. Have another meeting with the client where you sit down and create a requirement document.

Sometimes a project might be to complex to solve like that.

I have found it useful to establish 3 phases Discover, Design, Deploy. If possible tell the client that you can give them a fixed price on the discover phase. If they are satisfied with the work you deliver you will give them a price on the next phase. They can always choose to take the work from each phase elsewhere. But at least you don't promise them and have to do huge write-downs (especially if development is involved)

Obviously the smaller a company you are the more you want to prove yourself. Often you will end up spending way too much time on a project. That isn't necessarily a problem when you are small. But the second you grow to 2-3 people you really need to make sure that you don't end up having to work 3 times that of what have been budgeted. It's better to have a happy customer leaving you because you are too expensive than because you don't meet your deadlines.

And remember always underpromise, overdeliver.

You might try creating a set of "fixed price / fixed deliverable" modules.

Along the lines of  "for $12K, you'd get X deliverable and then we'd typically expect that you'd move to the second phase and then for $14K you'd get Y deliverable." 

Put enough hours into these so that you're sure you're covering your costs and make sure there's enough real value in the deliverable so that your clients will be able to actually implement something.

To my best experience what it works is a fixed price/project scheme.
The difficult part is to define what "project" is.

Meet with the customer, gather the project requirements and come up with a WELL defined list of deliverable. The closest to a Chinese menu the better. 

I say Chinese menu because it should be broken to the smallest pieces of development/service offered possible.  
This way your customer, knows exactly what he receives without surprising questions such as: "I though you'll do that".  

Go through each development/service in the list and put a cost to it. Add extra cost for change requests and support and you have a good price list.

I believe that in order to maximise profit you shouldn't be trying to find a generalised price. Obviously you need to be competitive and this involves finding out how much your opponents charge for varying project sizes. 

Different projects will obviously be of varying sizes, you don't want to shoot yourself in the foot by offering a price for 100 man hours that really is going to take 200.


Maybe a good idea would be to focus on how many hours the average project takes, find a price for that and work off it. 

Good luck anyway.

Melanie.  You are wise in determining that you will need to calculate some sort of fixed fee because clients will want to compare your rates against others. I agree with Stefanos that you should clearly define in the proposal/agreement exactly what it is that your client is getting for their money.  Also be sure to include caviates for issues that may come up that would trigger higher fees.  For example.  I spent many years as a financial auditor.  Our fee agreements were a fixed fee for an audit, but included language that the cost would be higher if they client wasn't ready and we had to re-schedule or if their books required excessive adjustments, etc.

Do you want a very powerful marketing pitch?  Here is what I tell all of my clients regarding my outsoured CFO projects, which, by the way, are hourly arrangements but I give them an estimated # of hours with each project. I tell them: "My rate is $190/hour and I estimate it will take X # of hours.  However, you are paying for quality, not quantity.  At the end of the engagement I want you to ultimately pay me what it is worth to you.  If I have done such a lousy job that you think is worthless, you owe me nothing.  But I'm confident that the results will be of such value to you that you won't mind paying me even more than the estimated fees."

Good luck.  Feel free to contact me directly if you want to discuss further.  ghippe@smartfinancials.net.

<p>I think the fixed price model suggested by Civil and Stefanos is a good way to go.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, read Neil Davidson's free downloadable ebook <a href="http://downloads.businessofsoftware.org/dontjustrollthedice.pdf" rel="nofollow">Don't Just Roll the Dice</a>. It's geared towards software pricing, but I think it has some information that can help you. </p>
