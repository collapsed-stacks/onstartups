I use google analytics to analyze the visitors , no of pages visited and other stats for my web site [Skill-guru][1]


  [1]: http://www.skill-guru.com

I have also added my site on compete.com . I was looking at unique visitors count on compete and there was a big difference between number of unique visitors reported by google compared to compete.
Do they use different parameters to count the unique users ?

Google Analytics is much more accurate than Compete.com because GA uses a tracking pixel and Compete does not.

Compete is just an estimate, and I've seen it be wrong by an order of magnitude.  I wouldn't trust it at all if you can help it; if you do look at it, just count the number of digits in the number.
