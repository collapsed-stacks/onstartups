I have made a prototype for my restaurant reservation and wait-list management startup in India and most of them don't have internet access so how do I deal with that problem can you suggest me a solution.

Well, I bet most of them would have mobile phones. Can your product work with mobile internet or SMS to solve the communication issue?

If you mean you want to share your prototype with restaurants that don't have Internet, you could fax prototype images as John Bogrand suggested.  If you don't have a fax machine, you could always use an internet fax service to email the images to their fax machine (Internet fax uses email as a fax machine).  

You can easily use your smartphone as a fax machine to send information to prospective clients while you're on the go too. Some mobile apps enable you to scan/photograph documents using your smartphone and faxing them that way, so you don't even need your computer to have faxing capabilities.

You might have to research a little more. India is a country where we are still behind in terms of broadband adoption , thus you will be only catering to a niche market , top restaurants who will probably have internet access and whose customers also would be aware of all the things necessary. 

If its not a web app, you need to get out in the field , first market locally only  as you also need to service the solution and to cant keep travelling around the country alone.

If it is a web app then you might have some problems. Some web apps can work in offline mode using something like Google Gears, but that is not an ideal solution. You can also use Silverlight in 'out of browser' mode. 

But I think you need to describe the situation better. If they have no internet ever a web based app is no good. If they just have no internet from the front of store but access in the back office, you could use a partially connected solution.

I'd fax prototype images to them.
