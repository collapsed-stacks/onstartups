Yes, you can do this.  

I think you pay taxes the same way as for your US customers, but hopefully someone else can confirm.

<p>Yes, an LLC can do business in Canada.  You should probably be aware of the major taxes that you might need to pay, namely the GST/HST and the income tax.  Read CRA's <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/nnrsdnts/bsnss/menu-eng.html" rel="nofollow">exposition for non-resident businesses</a>.</p>

<p>The GST/HST is a value-added tax on goods and services.  You might need to collect and remit this tax to the Canada Revenue Agency, depending on the type of goods/services provided, how much work is actually done in Canada, and whether your annual revenue exceeds $30000.  The GST/HST is not LLC-specific.</p>

<p>Your LLC may be subject to Canadian income tax, depending on how much work is actually done in Canada.  Even if you elect to treat the LLC as a flow-through entity for income tax purposes, Canada still treats the LLC as a corporation, and the LLC may need to file a Canadian income tax return as a non-resident corporation.</p>
