I have a web startup that we are getting ready to take live. I have researched a few companies that I am interested in partnering with to provide our site with custom services and products. I cannot find any information on what to expect from a commission perspective in the overall internet industry for partnerships. I know affiliate programs typically give 5-20% is this a good starting point? Or does it just come down to negotiation once you are introduced?  At a high level they would provide us custom packages of services/products and we would sell them on our site.  

I want to sound educated in this field when I reach out to these potential partners so any information you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

**Set your own prices to maximize profits.**

Add all your monthly expenses + some minimum monthly profit margin. Now estimate number of products you'll be able to sell in one month. Get the ratio.

This is minimum amount you want on each item sale. Now you can add some more amount or sell services at a discount. That's your marketing strategy.

Update:

Say you setup product A (your own) and Service B (someone else's)

Ideally you should set your own pricing for B to maximize your returns. B is likely to compete with A on your webpage. Also, you may happen to have customers with "big bucks", so you know...

Unless you are purchasing in volume, up front, or processing sales transactions on your own site (where you then send a Purchase Order to the vendor), it sounds like you are gearing up to be an affiliate. 

In this case, I would say, make your best deal but be prepared for a "show me the money" response. You may need to show conversions before you are offered a different, better price or commission structure.

You aren't going to find much industry information because at the end of the day it all comes down to how much money THEY make, not the commission you pay.  You have to balance your CPA (cost per acquisition) with conversion rates.  If your competitor converts half as well as you; you need only pay half as much commission (or bounty) to be competitive.

The industry calculates a more accurate measure of performance as EPC (earnings per click - and to make it confusing, unlike CPM which is for 1000 impressions, EPC is on only 100 clicks).   When you look at an affiliate network, merchants are compared by EPC, not commission.

Competitor A might have an EPC of $5 (meaning they earn publishers/partners $.05 per click)
Competitor B might have an EPC of $10 ($.10 per click)

BUT

A could be paying a commission of 10% while B pays only 5%
B converts better

Val is spot on about the proof to get started.  Run a couple of tests with some potential partners.  Give them a month at what you expect to pay and see how things perform.  You can track such a test through Google Analytics before setting yourself up on an affiliate network and needing to establish your rates.
