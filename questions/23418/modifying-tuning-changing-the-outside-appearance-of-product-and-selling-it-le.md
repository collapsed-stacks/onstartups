Imagine and Hp laptop, or a Mac. 
Would it be legal to modify the case of the laptop, for example change the color, shape and the materials and resell it as "modified by blah blah", or "designed by blaha" or "Hp laptop by blah blah". 

It will be written that it is an Hp laptop or a Mac, but in the case by "blah blah".

No software or hardware will be modified, only the appearance. Some buttons or LED's may be dysfunctional after appearance mod, but are merely covered by the case and are not removed from the motherboard. 

Is it legal?
The idea has nothing to do with laptops, it was just used as an example.

If you are advertising with the original manufacturers Label you will need his/her approval, otherwise they could legally punish you.

For an example, did you thing Microsoft would be happy, if you sell Software under their Label? Guess what, you would find yourself rather quick in a lawsuit.

However, that might not be always the case. But get yourself in a good legal position and ask for written agreement of the manufacturer.

Sure, it's legal, as long as you make it clear that you are not officially licensed by or affiliated with the OEM.  If any of your modifications alter what the purchaser would have originally been entitled too (most common: warranty) then that should be spelled out as well.

The closest example that comes to mind is the company that was converts MacBooks to tablets, these guys:

There are countless others though.

You can contact the original manufacturer and get some written agreement. I am afraid, that in some modification cases it can void the warranty.

The legality depends on the product that you are modifying.

For example, if you buy a Ford Mustang, modify it, and sell it, then I don't see any legal problem.

If you do the same with software, however, it could be a problem since software is licensed and not sold.
