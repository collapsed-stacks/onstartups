Is there a particular place with, or a particular technique to use for finding different kinds of market data?

For instance, I want to look up what research has been done on internal communications efficiency in corporations (not specific ones), such as, for instance: per person the average # emails received/day, how many hours each person spends on answering email, how much time is wasted in meetings on off-topic talks, etc.

I know that there are companies that can find such data, such as the Empire Research Group. Are there alternatives?

<p>A great source for this kind of information is <a href="http://www.statista.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.statista.com/</a>. Also, there is a <a href="http://computeraidedfinance.com/2012/05/02/comprehensive-list-of-free-historical-market-data-sources/" rel="nofollow">list of market data sources from computeraidedfinance</a>. This list includes economic and exchange trade data, too.</p>

I personally use http://www.zanran.com which is a search engine for numbers.

I found a lot of existing market studies via zanran.

Your public library and the folks that work there have been a great source  of that sort of information for me in the past. It can be a little counter intuitive in this day and age to go to a paper book, but there is good information in the reference section.
