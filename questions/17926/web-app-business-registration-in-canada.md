I'm getting close to completing my web application and I'd like to start dealing with the business aspects of it (I'm a programmer first and foremost!)

I need to register my business name in Canada. At this point, I'm not sure what I should use as my corporate name - or whether I need to incorporate. Do I want to use ***.com? It would be nice, for example, if I could choose a name that I can operate under while doing other development work but maybe that's a compromise I can't make.

My questions don't really stop there. Actually, I'm pretty naive in these aspects so I humbly ask for any experiences others on this site have had getting the paperwork taken care of. 

In essence I just want a business name that I can keep safe and I want to legally be able to get paid.

you can do everything all yourself online, its fast and you can have a business incorporated with a matter of a day or two

go to industry Canada: http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs04210.html

first you will need to do a name lookup and purchase a NUANS report, cost around $20

then you will need to incorporate your business with industry Canada, they will require you upload the NUANS report

look around the site, read the info, however finding the right links can be a pain, but everything is all there for you!

.com is not limited to the US or any other country.  It has international acceptance, so with any .com name you will be fine.

It is also common practice to have your business name be different than your .com.
The problem is that sometimes you cannot find a .com name for your business because another business or site with the same name has already snagged it up.

If you want them to match, your best bet is to find a .com name first, then name your business the same.
