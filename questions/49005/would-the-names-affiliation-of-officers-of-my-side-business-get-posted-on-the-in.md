I heard of websites such as corporationwiki that dig internet/state records for company information and post that data online. How many such sites are there and how can I stop this information being on internet?

(I intend to disclose it later, but until it's found to be feasible to continue operating, I would like my or officers name not connected with the company. Some states' such as CA public records do not make this information searchable without fees.)

Create an LLC in Wyoming or Nevada using a registered agent.  Both states allow you to hide the identity of the owners.  However, hiring a registered agent may prevent your personal information from showing up in these directories.
