Two questions:

a) Is there a site (or sites) that tracks active business plan competitions. Ideally a collection of competitions that are accepting submissions, rules of entry, prize money (if any), theme/focus, region of entry, etc.

b) I am mentoring a student group that is thinking of using business plan competitions as an additional channel of getting the word out about their products as well as receive feedback that they can put to work. Prize money is a bonus but not the primary objective. If you tried this approach as part of your startup how did that workout for you?
