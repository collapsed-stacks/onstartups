Which will cover issues like, things I will need to know in advance, technical difficulties, how to scale/deal with increased load, marketing strategies even?! etc etc.

I love [Getting Real][1] by 37signals, your favorites?

<p>Not a technical book, but <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1591840562" rel="nofollow">Art of the Start</a> by Guy Kawasaki covers about everything else. Scaling issues will probably be platform dependent (LAMP, .NET, Python, RoR). The creators of StackExchange &amp; StackOverflow have talked about their scaling challenges in their podcast; they could probably write a book.</p>

<p>For marketing strategies check out Dharmesh's book, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470499311" rel="nofollow">Inbound Marketing</a>. Dharmesh is one of the hosts of this site.</p>

<p>Also check out this <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/9008/Startup-Marketing-Tactical-Tips-From-The-Trenches.aspx" rel="nofollow">post</a> from Dharmesh. It's the best list I've found on marketing To Dos for a startup.</p>

<p>I think a good book any startup founder must read is "Crossing the Chasm". I have read almost 3/4ths of the book so far and I have learnt so much and have corrected my way of thinking towards marketing a product or a product type.</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0066620023" rel="nofollow">Crossing the Chasm on Amazon</a></p>

<p>A used or second hand book is good enough for this.</p>

There are boatloads of books -- maybe check out Founders At Work for detailed interviews with founders on how they did it.

Art of the Start: while probably valuable, you have to take this with something of a grain of salt. Guy is great, but he's never started his own company.

37 Signals' Getting Real: not about startups. Maybe worth reading, although you have to sift through their penchant for posturing.

I would recommend reading Founders at Work and then Do More, Faster. They are two of the best books for any internet startup because they cover what it is like to start a business and then how to pull it off.
