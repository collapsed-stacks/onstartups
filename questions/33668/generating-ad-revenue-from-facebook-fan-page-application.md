We are planning to create a facebook fan page/application which has the potential of driving in a daily traffic of 100,000.However,we are not clear about the revenue generating model.Is there any ad revenue sharing model between facebook and the developers or atleast a anyway of securing ad revenue?Obviously,driving traffic from facebook to our website shall not workout as we understand that only a very small proportion is willing to do so.Waiting for the replies....

<p>Facebook's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php" rel="nofollow">Page Guidelines</a> prohibit third-party advertisements.</p>

<p>For applications, Facebook has a specific list of ad networks that can be used: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/adproviders/" rel="nofollow">http://developers.facebook.com/adproviders/</a> - no advertising from outside these networks is allowed. Presumably there's a way to become an approved ad provider on Facebook, but I can't seem to find any info on Facebook itself.</p>
