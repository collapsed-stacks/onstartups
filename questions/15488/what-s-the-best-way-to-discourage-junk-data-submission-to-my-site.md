I'm working on a search site.  But the data being searched is only the data submitted by the public.  I have no need for users, but I want to discourage people/bots from submitting complete junk that would lessen the usefulness of the site.

So far, i'm considering a CAPTCHA or confirmation via a link sent to the submitter in email.

Thoughts?

CAPTCHA is a bit of a hassle for your users but the trade off is it's the current standard for ensuring data is submitted by a human.  Implementing CAPTCHA some time back on out web site reduced spam from forms to zero.
