I have an idea in mind for a SaaS product in the health industry - specifically, for small clinics, optometrists and dentists. 

I'm slated to start development on this in the next few days and would love to get some answers about marketing and the general sector. I do not have experience in the field but analogous products do exist so I know the idea is a needed one.

If anyone with sales/bus. dev. experience in this sector is interested in partnering up or answering a few questions, please get in touch @ gagabanoosh@gmail.com. If you work in the sectors mentioned above, even better. I'd love to hear from you.

Thank you.

I used to write medical (health) software and the market is competitive. You will need to do some research to narrow down the area you would like to start in i.e. small clinics, optometrists or dentists. Once you have then focus on seeing what other products are out there. Medical software is complicated because patient data is so sensitive. Dentistry software is less complicated, but you have hardware issues. Many dentists now have integrated x-rays and photo equipment directly into the software.

I was a co-founder in a start-up and we took just over 1 year with 6 guys to get a product together to deliver software to the medical industry. The company was later sold, so I've moved on to writing software for Foster Care Agencies.

I'm not sure if my reply helps you or not but get in touch with me if you need to.

I helped launch a startup in the health industry a few years ago. Unfortunately, it didn't go well for them for a number of reasons. One of those reasons was lack of understanding and reaching their target audience. Many health practices choose to stick with the processes they understand - couriers, faxes, and paper records. Be sure you know how to reach the segment of your market that is interested in your solution *before* you start developing the product. Understand what they want and what they fear so that you can create a good match for them. Otherwise, you'll build something you can sell.
