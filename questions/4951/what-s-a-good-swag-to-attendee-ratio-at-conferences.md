As we start going to conferences in 2010, I'm curious what the right amount of swag per attendee should be. Obviously, not everyone wants stuff and I think there's some panache to having the cool, limited swag that everyone wants but only some people got. Or not!

An upcomming conference will have 700+ attendees; we were thinking of coming with 250 pieces of fairly awesome swag (it'll be... something different... and will cost us $6-7/ea). The hope is... if the swag is successful, higher quantity printing will drive cost down by 50%+.

Anyway... will we have too much swag?

The more awesome the swag, the more people want it.

Even at conferences with 1000's of people we could give away books to 40%-50% of the attendees.  At conferences which were less relevant it was down around 15%.  At small conferences (500 or less) it could be 80%.

How hard is it to ship extras home?  If not hard, take extras -- no reason to run out.

$7 does sound really high.  If it's that valuable, it's reasonable to ask them to do something to earn it.  Examples:

* Fill out a short (4-question) survey.
* Listen to your 90-second pitch.
* Watch your 90-second video.
* Actually talk to you about your stuff.

We've used all of the above and people are willing if the swag is good.  

In fact, when there *isn't*  a catch and we were giving away books, many people would ask "What do I have to do to get a book?"

**At the very least get the badge scanned.** You at least deserve the demographics, emails, and companies of the people who cared.  People are *never* unhappy to do that for good swag.

I agree with your approach of creating some scarcity (because that does indeed increase demand).  If everyone is guaranteed to get the swag, less people will want it.

And, for most higher-end items, the marginal cost does not go down that much at higher volume (not like it does with printed stuff)

Personally, I'd lean towards a lower volume of swag that you're almost guaranteed to give away.  It's sort of painful and depressing to carry a bunch of swap back home.  Your 250 number doesn't sound too high, but if it were me, I'd drift closer to 150.

$6-$7 sounds expensive...  We gave out webcams that cost us $3.1, so I wonder what you will be giving away.

The thing is, unless people know that there is only a limited quantity, they won't feel any hurry to get your stuff early, which means that the effect you are going for will now happen.  Some people will get the stuff, and be happy but won't be aware of "how lucky they are" and others will be annoyed since they didn't manage to get it.

We ordered more cameras then we needed since we will use them in future events as well...

Not sure how much this applies to your situation, but for our company the most important aspects of any show we are at is getting potential customers:

 1. To know we are at the show and that we provide online coaching and video editing
 2. To come by the booth and engage with us - once they are at the booth and talking with us, we have have had a lot of success converting sales
 3. To give us their contact information and tell us about their current situation and needs related to video

In our situation, it is more important to have the broad awareness that we are there than it is for someone who comes by the booth to take something home with them. We are almost always able to get some contact information and can follow up proactively with leads after the clinic.

We have some swag we give out and we try to keep it cool and relevant for our clients. But, one piece of trade show "swag" that we've found to be really underrated is the bag. Regardless of how cool it is, at the trade shows we go to pretty much everyone is looking for a bag to put all their free stuff in. Then they carry around this bag and display your logo/brand/info to everyone else at the show. The cooler the bag, the more likely they are to ditch their crappy plastic bag and put all their stuff in yours. For less than $6-7 per, you could probably get a pretty nice bag to hand out that would achieve what you are looking for and would get your logo in front of a lot of people.

In my mind - it is less important to make the swag really cool/pricey and more important that it achieves your goals at the show. The pricier item that is going to be more attractive to attendees might be the best choice for you guys, but I just wanted to bring up the importance of making sure you don't give out a really expensive piece of swag that 100 people put in their bag and maybe tell one person about as opposed to getting exposure to hundreds of people at the event through something like a nice bag or other item that people will carry around and naturally advertise for you with.
