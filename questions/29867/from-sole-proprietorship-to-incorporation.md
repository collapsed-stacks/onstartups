I have a health care business as a sole proprietor, I would like to incorporate it for liability reason. Would I be able to use the same TIN, and NPI numbers when I convert? Or I need new numbers? Thank you.

<p>You'll need a new federal tax ID. California (where we conduct business) converted our sole prop state tax ID to the corporation with the filing of a required form.</p>

<p>Our CPA was absolutley invaluable in guiding us through these types of issues when we incorporated. </p>

<p>You might also benefit from the book I mention in <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/q/12532/888">this question on incorporating</a>.</p>
