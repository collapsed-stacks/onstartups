I just launched a funding campaign at SellAnApp. I am emailing multiple blogs and forums to help me spread the word and gain some great traction but I am running out of ideas. If this was you running a funding campaign, how would you go about promoting and marketing the campaign without spending tons of money? 

P.S. I also created a promo video and uploaded it to youtube but I need to find a way to get more traffic to the video as well.
