I need your opinions about which email structure should we go with. For example my name is Gregory Gillespie. 

> gillespie@company.com<br>ggillespie@company.com  <br>g.gillespie@company.com <br>
> gregory.gillespie@company.com

This is for formal purposes, web pages and mostly business cards and all the employers will have the same email structure.
<br> I am concerned about the fact that *gg* does not look so good and my *name.surname* is big, even the company's name.

Personally I prefer choice number 3, but what do you suggest me ?

I like greg@company.com or gregory@company.com.  

How big do you expect to get?  The only trouble is if you end up with a few greg's in the company.

Keeping short means you don't have to spell it out as often over the phone, and also is a bi friendlier.

I would set up a catch all with all the option going to one account. I also like people who make it easy for me to remember their email addresses. I remember the head of a chain of car dealerships in the UK had his email address as headnut@ ... It drew a laugh, and look 13 years later I still remember it. 

You could also use your job title ceo@  or some combination with your name GregCEO@ 

Bottom line: make it easy to remember.
