I now have my website up. I have listed top 6 features on "homepage". I have 29 vital features to my service (Live-Chat) that needs to be listed on "features" page. I tried various templates but they all end up looking crammed with too much info.

I have even tried using pop-up tool tips but didn't get good feedback.

Is there anyway that I could list all of the features(Image + benefit) for each & still look clean?

I would focus more on benefits other than mere features. Customers purchase because each feature gives them a benefit, not because the feature is merely there, so you should make sure to explain all benefits, perhaps tied to a specific feature, but focus on benefits.

That said, as Christian suggested, I would use the home page to explain the benefits your application gives (and no one else), then have a dedicated area for detailed benefits and features description.

I would recommend you to check out your favorite service sites in the web and see how they did it.

My first thought is:

  - Top features on the homepage - "read more" link leads to a 2-column page listing the top features of each category. Each feature box probably need a nice looking image
  - if you have different service degrees, make a feature comparison matrix

Here are some examples I like:

  - https://github.com/plans (for simple feature lists three column modell)
  - http://order.1and1.com/xml/order/Hosting (matrix)
  - http://www.enstore.com/ (scroll to the bottom)

And if you have a designer at your site, you should ask him. :-)
