I'm thinking of working (as a contractor) for a Texas based business; I am interested in forming an LLC/LLP, and looking to do so in the most cost effective way.

I read that **A LLC must register as a “foreign” LLC in each jurisdiction in which it is “doing business” other than the jurisdiction in which it was formed**. Meaning, if I form my LLC/LLP in the state of CT, I will still (presumably) need to be registered as a “foreign” LLC in TX.

My question is, does the above apply to foreign (non-US) businesses? For instance, do I still have to register as a “foreign” LLC/LLP in TX if my business is registered, say, in France?

That is correct, you do need to register as a foreign entity if the company is registered abroad.

> Whether an entity is domestic or foreign does not depend on the location of the principal business office. Instead, it depends on where the entity was formed and what law governs its internal affairs. If an organization was formed under, and the internal affairs are governed by, the laws of a jurisdiction other than Texas, the organization is a “foreign entity.” We sometimes refer to foreign entities as out-of-state entities to reinforce the concept that entities formed in other U.S. states are foreign entities, as well as entities formed outside of the United States.

The fee is $750:

This is the penalty if you don't:

> A foreign entity that has transacted business in Texas for more than ninety days without registering is subject to a late filing fee. The
> late filing fee is equal to the registration fee for each full or
> partial calendar year that the foreign entity transacted business in
> Texas without being registered.

Have you considered forming a separate entity in Texas from scratch or does it need to be associated with the company formed abroad?
