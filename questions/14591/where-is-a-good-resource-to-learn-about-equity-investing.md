My partner and I currently run a website and we both have a 50 percent stake.  Some investors want to come on board and also want to help us promote it.  In return they would get a smaller equity stock in our company.  Where could I find the resources to make this work/legal?

<p>There are many blogs on the topic; my favourite are <a href="http://venturehacks.com/" rel="nofollow">venturehacks</a>, <a href="http://www.avc.com/" rel="nofollow">avc</a> and <a href="http://startuplawyer.com" rel="nofollow">startuplawyer</a>.</p>

<p>Also YCombinator has published some <a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html" rel="nofollow">standard documents for series A funding</a>.</p>

<p>You have to read all of them to understand the terminology and common risks. Unfortunately (because it costs money), you will still need to hire a lawyer to write the contracts, or check that the contracts proposed by your investor doesn't contain entrepreneur-unfriendly clauses. </p>

<p>If I understand your question correctly then <a href="http://venturehacks.com/" rel="nofollow">venturehacks</a> is a useful resource. (Specifically the archives)</p>
