I am starting to get very frustrated, after 2 yrs of crazy amounts of work and $70K invested and having my website online for 1 yr I already have 120,000 monthly visitors but still can't monetize the traffic as I would like. Adsense brings chump change, I had a sponsor for the first semester of the year which was paying very good but it stopped and everything was reinvested to continue developing the site. Now I am pretty tight in money and therefore I can't launch an e-commerce store which could bring in the much needed revenue. Should I focus on continue uploading content and wait until the time is right to launch the store online? This site is for the Mexican/Hispanic Market so no option for drop shipping or anything similar and as well it is a population which is in its infancy stage in online commerce. I am attaching an image of the growth I am having so far. It's all been organic.

Be sure you are capturing email addresses from your visitors.  in a few months you could have a list you can do sponsors through worth 100s - 1000s.  Just vet the list well. Just an idea.

Have you talked to any of your visitors/potential customers?  Do you have a way of communicating with them?  Could be comments, Twitter, a contact page, anything to be able to start a conversation and see what they want and are interested in, and use that to fuel ideas for monetizing.  Without knowing anything more about your site, I don't think anyone can give any more specific advice.

As far as advertising, if you can find companies who are interested in your audience specifically you could try approaching them for an advertising deal.  You might get better results that way than through Adsense, although it would be more work on your part.

One option would be allow premium subscriptions. Offer users that decide to pay something extra; this could be as small as an gold star by their icon but it would be better if you could give them more relevant content and features.

You've got the community, but you need the product, and you need to provide a way to get paid. You have created something that gives value to the users, but you need to allow them to give back.
