I am sort of divided on whether to link my affiliate program under my company information or just hide a link and have it only used when I send it to someone.

I looked at companies like `https://affiliate.37signals.com/affiliate` I could not find a link to the program from the site. Although it is possible it has been removed now since they do not accept new affiliates.

What are the thought on how to market AP?

It is common to put 'Affiliate Program'  link at the footer. Most affiliates know about this and search it there.
