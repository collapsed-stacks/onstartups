## Am I worrying too much about my IP?

I've spent the better part of the last several years developing a product/algorithm, and although I lack the time/funds to do an exhaustive patent search, I'm 99.99% certain that the algorithm is patentable.  I think the algorithm has multiple potential applications, and the first product (mobile app) is ready to move into testing.  I'd like to begin contacting potential investors, but I also want to do my best to make sure that my IP is protected.  After release, the algorithm could probably be reverse-engineered with a modest amount of effort.  I realize that a good patent attorney could be helpful here, but I really just don't have the budget for one at this point.

I've read the relevant parts of the NOLO patent book and all the other info I can get my hands on, and I've spent about a month attempting to come up with a writeup that I can either get witnessed or use as the basis for a provisional patent, but so far the going is very slow as I am attempting to document the generalities as well as the specifics.  Part of the difficulty is that I'm not sure about exactly how much I need to document.  There is a lot of supporting machinery around the core algorithm which could vary in an alternate embodiment, and flowcharts tend to be difficult to work with, especially when expressing state/concurrency.  I do not doubt that I *can* document all this, but it may take quite a bit of time, and I'm worried that it could sap all momentum from the project.  I'd rather be coding and advancing the product.

I do not have a lot of documentation of the invention other than my source code, and I am aware that this is not an ideal scenario.  But if I'm planning on opening the project to testers soon anyway, is releasing the product itself sufficient to document that I am the first to invent?  (I am aware that this gives me a 1 year deadline to file, and there is no remote logic in the application).  I am under the impression that this might be a problem in countries where the rule is "first to file" as opposed to "first to invent", but I'm not sure I can afford to worry about that right now.

It might be an outside chance, but my other worry is that I might get an early investor that wants to develop the product further without releasing, which would leave me somewhat exposed until I get a patent application filed.  But that would also hopefully mean funds to hire a patent attorney.

If you can't afford to protect your IP, you won't have any IP to protect.

An initial consultation with a patent attorney (at least in the US) is free. Do it.

The get an investor, or get a second job, or take out a loan, and patent your invention.

<p>Agree with Gary - you need the cash to protect / defend a patent, and sitting down with a patent attorney will answer more questions that we can from this side of the web. </p>

<p>This doesn't mean that you become a patent troll - it means that you have to actively protect against infringement or possibly lose your rights.</p>

<p>Also, if you're concerned about "first to file" issues, consider a provisional patent, get your date set, then go about making the business work.  Here's a post of <a href="http://www.startupnation.com/business-articles/9079/1/choose-patent-type.htm" rel="nofollow">provisional / non-provisional patent strategies</a> to consider.</p>
