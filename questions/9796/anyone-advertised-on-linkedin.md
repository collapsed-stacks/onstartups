I've done lots of advertising including Facebook. Have not done Linkedin though. My company has a product targeted at eBay sellers. Anyone have any experience and any suggestions?

Much appreciated,

Ebay and LinkedIn have two completely different demographics. Do you know what your target audience looks like? I would not waste my money of this advertising opportunity unless their profile matches your marketing needs.

You mean advertising at Linkedin like putting a banner there or utilize your network to spread the word about your product?

I believe most businesses using it for the latter.
