I am planning of creating a free software in upcoming months. I also wants to monetize my advertise my software by different forms of advertisements. These are:

A) **PPC advertisement on web site** : This will be much like Google Adsense for websites

B) **PPC advertisement on software downloader** : This will be much like [Cnet spotinstall][2] and one will display one or two ads during the software download.

C) **Advertising through software module** This will be much like [OpenCandy][3].

No, more ads will be displayed during software running. So, my question is how the user will react to these ads. 

 - Will the user feel them annoying? Does this make my software a adware? 
 - Are chances are high that user will abort download be seeing ads in the download manager?

Adverts are almost always annoying, which is why I have an ad-blocker in my browser and hardly ever watch live TV (Sky+ lets you skip adverts easily).

It depends on the expectations of your users, but generally people react negatively to adverts, as they are so poorly targeted and repetitive.
