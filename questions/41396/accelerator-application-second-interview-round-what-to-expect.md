We are applying to an accelerator program, and got past the first two rounds, including the interview. This answer was really helpful while preparing: [http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/37379/what-should-we-expect-in-an-accelerator-interview][1]

However, there is a last round, another interview, and I'm wondering what to expect. Obviously, we know the weak points of our last interview, and most probably they'll ask about those topics.

We think we have validated our team and our abilities pretty well, but were weaker at pitching our product.

Does anybody have some hands on experience about these follow up interviews?

I actually went through this process last month myself.

The final interview seemed much easier than the telephone interview the round before to me.  In my experience it almost seemed as if there mind was made up before I had arrived to the final interview (we were successful).

The final interview was mainly just about explaining the idea to members of the panel who had not seen it up until that point.  We gave a few demos and explained how we planned to use the time and money if we were successful.
