If I own one repair shop and I am looking to purchase another one can I start a holding company and not be classified as a personal holding company?

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company#Personal_holding_company" rel="nofollow">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Personal holding company</p>
  
  <p>In the United States, a personal
  holding company is defined in section
  542 of the Internal Revenue Code. A
  corporation is a personal holding
  company if both of the following
  requirements are met:<a href="http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/old/14469571.htm" rel="nofollow">2</a></p>

<pre><code>* Personal Holding Company Income Test: 
  At least 60% of the corporation's adjusted ordinary gross income 
  for the tax year is from dividends, interest, rent, and royalties.

* Stock Ownership Requirement:
  At any time during the last half of the tax year, more than 50% 
  in value of the corporation's outstanding stock is owned, 
  directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I am not an accountant or CPA or attorney, but it seems to me that you can't do anything much about part 2, but if you can insure that more than 40% of the income from the business(es) come from thing other than those listed then you are ok.</p>

<p>I don't know how the treatment is different for personal holding companies compared to "Regular" holding companies.</p>

<p>EDIT - <a href="http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/old/14469571.htm" rel="nofollow">here is the reason I guess</a>:</p>
