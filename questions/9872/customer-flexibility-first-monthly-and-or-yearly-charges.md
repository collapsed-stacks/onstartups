We have one application sold to users - they make documents with it. These documents are then sold to their clients.The client must have the reader to view the media rich document. We make and sell the reader also.

The application is less than $400 and only sold as a yearly subscription. Installed on their machine only - not SaaS.

The viewer is web only (users log into their account) and is less than $80 per annum.

The app and viewer are selling well but I believe the viewer could sell better. The viewers are mainly owned by the app owner - They administer each account as they see fit. All works well.

Consideration.
Change viewer model to per month payment - Approx $6 per month.
The owner can delete and add viewers to his account each month.
The owner is billed according to high water mark for month. 
Bill on one day each month for all account holders.
Initial purchasers buying products less than 15 days prior to billing day can have it free until first billing cycle. To be fair. Rather than prorate. 

Flexibility is a real priority for our users - as they fluctuate in client numbers.
A yearly fee may be restricting their business model - we are yet to test but focus groups say it does.

Do you see any issues with monthly fee for such a small fee per month? Compared to our possible gain in sales + a happier user who will have choice in using/paying for only what they need? Does the model proposed sound OK?

Thanks in advance.

Great questions!

It might be hard for us to answer in the abstract because it sounds like the answer depends on the attitude and use-cases of your customer base.  The good news is you're aware of this and factoring it in, so probably you're on the right track.

On giving them "free until first billing cycle" -- that's fantastic.  You know the complexity of pro-rating isn't worth the $3 of revenue you'd get out of it, and you also buy yourself the right to say "We bill on the Nth of the month and we'll comp you the first piece of the first month."  What a wonderful way to start a billing relationship!

For most people it's annoying to have bills that fluctuate month-to-month.  Often businesses prefer something flat (like "$X for up to 10 users") so they can budget properly.  Then again, you stated that your customers' usage fluctuates, so if you believe they *want* their bill to fluctuate, then you should ignore this paragraph.

Still, with something as little as $6/mo, do I really care whether it's $12 or $18 in any one month?  Could it just be e.g. $34.95 for 6 users?  Remember that you can discount more with more customers because at the low end you might be getting $34 for just 1-2 users where currently you'd get $6-$12.

Put another way, is $12 that different than $49 for this customer base? If no, having "tiers" probably means more profit without customers caring that much.

I agree - I like the model with a fixed monthly charge and the lots of flexibility for me as the user.  i.e., the "$34.95 for up to six users" approach. 

Keep it simple ***and*** keep it predictable. 

Not only does that help your clients - it gives you a better ability to plan and forecast future revenue.
