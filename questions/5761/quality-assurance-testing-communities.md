I've been developing a [test plan / test case management tool][1] and am nearing the point where I will release version 1.0. 

Can anyone point me to any online communities of software testing / quality assurance personnel that I might not already be aware of?

Thank you

Are you aware of uTest.com?

Bob Walsh's podcast on this topic is great:

Follow the numbers - number will guide good QA decision making.

You did not mention requirements reviews or design reviews, or any other QA steps. Have these been done? The numbers show these QA steps are more effective (several times more effective)  than "software testing". It does not matter what stage you are at, even if you have the code done, do these steps before you do "software testing". (This is the advice Tom Gilb gives, and having been there and done that, I would agree with him).
