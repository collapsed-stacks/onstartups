A VC contacted me about a few weeks ago and he has been wanting to speak just about every week to talk about my business idea.

The idea is still pre-product,and very early on.

What are the potential intentions of VC's like this?

He told me on the first call "As soon as you have a product, let me know and we'll discuss more if you need funding, contacts, etc"

A VC? VCs invest big sums of money and it 's quite strange for one to go after you, unless you are already a proven entrepreneur with a great record. Perhaps more of a business angel?

In any case, you need to get the product, nothing can go on without it (and if it does, you 'll lose a lot of equity as a result)
