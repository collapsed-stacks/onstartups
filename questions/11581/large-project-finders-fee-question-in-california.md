## Large Project Finders' Fee Question in California

I need insight into my finder's fee transaction taking place in California.

I am acting as a finder on a business venture that consists of myself having found a large investor for a large project developer. I do not do this regularly, but have a wealth of business experience and strong network especially for my young age (mid 20's). The project developer and I have already signed a finder's fee agreement agreeing to give myself 3% of funds raised. Although I am being asked to do more in terms of consulting and drawing up business plans, I have not, and am hesitant to do so because I am unlicensed and do not wish to overstep legal boundaries into unregistered broker/dealer territory. The deal has reached the point of LOC's being signed in anticipation of a JV agreement looks extremely promising. 

Can I receive some clarification on what I can/cannot do and what other things I can watch out for? What is the best course of action from here and what types of things should I negotiate for additionally if my percent fee is asked to be lowered by the investing group?

Thank you.

I'm not exactly sure on the "what I can and cannot do" part.  As a CPA, I'm prohibited from engaging in the practice of law or giving legal advice. So, I will have to pass on that issue.

However in terms of being asked to negotiate the 3%, I would stick to your agreement that you have in writing.  They could always turn the deal down altogether, but I doubt if slashing your cut down to 2% from 3% would make or break the deal for them.  Plus, 3% seems rather low to begin with. Considering how tight the credit markets are right now, I would think someone who can find funding would be highly valued (and compensated).  If asked to negotiate, I would point out that you have an agreement in writing and "a deal's a deal" as they say.

Good luck.
