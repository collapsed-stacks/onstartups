<p>On a website that hosts startups I saw these terms next to "funding":</p>

<ul>
<li>Bootstrapped</li>
<li>Seed Round</li>
<li>Series A</li>
<li>Series B</li>
<li>Series C</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone please explain what exactly are all these terms?</p>

<p>I found a nice explanation <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/23832/what-is-the-difference-between-series-a-series-b-and-series-c-investment">here</a> about Series A/Series B/Series C. But I did not manage to find some detailed information about "Bootstrapped" or other types of funding.</p>

<p><strong>Bootstrapped</strong>: No funding from outside sources. Just using your own cash, sweat, and later on, revenue from customers.</p>

<p><strong>Seed round</strong>: Early, high-risk investment. Usually from individual angel investors. This is generally before you get significant revenue i.e. before fully achieving product/market fit. It's money to build your product and iterate towards a point where you are ready to scale. High risk = expensive, so you have to lose proportionally more of your company in exchange for less money. </p>

<p><strong>Series A/B/C</strong>: Institutional investment from VCs. Generally happens during growth phase when your idea is proven, you have significant traction with customers, you have achieved product/market fit and you need money to scale fast. This is lower risk (and progressively lower again for each later A/B/C/whatever round), so you generally give less of the company away.</p>
