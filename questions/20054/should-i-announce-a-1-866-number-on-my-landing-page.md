My company has a toll-free number (1-866) in the US. Will it improve my conversion rate if I announce this number on the landing page for my AdWords campaign?

Will people feel more confident if they see a toll free number, or will they be scared away?

Always have a phone number on your landing page.  Always.  In fact, you should, if possible, get a "landing page" number so you can track phone conversions from your campaign.  There are companies that offer this service pretty cheap (I can't remember them off the top of my head).
