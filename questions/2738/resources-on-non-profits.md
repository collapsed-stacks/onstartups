You need to state how familiar you are with non-profits before we can recommend stuff to you...  I have a great link for you on non-profit web design:

http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/14/non-profit-website-design-examples-and-best-practices/

But who knows if it's useful to you since you do not say how much you already know...

<p>Does not look like there is much interest for non-profits/social enterprises in this forum. Anyway I looked around and found SERI. (Social Enterprise RhodeIsland)
 Here is a <a href="http://www.socialenterpriseri.org/index.php?option=com%5Fcontent&amp;view=article&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=133" rel="nofollow">link</a> to some non-profit, social enterprise books.</p>

LOL -- marking your own answer as the best answer -- that's one way to generate rep.  Good thinking! :)
