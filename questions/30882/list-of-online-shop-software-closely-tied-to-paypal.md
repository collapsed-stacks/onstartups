i want to gather a list of online shop software that is closely tied to paypal. I've seen a piece of software that provides you with a cool interface where you can add your products and then checkout with paypal that was costing something from 10 USD to 30 USD a month.  

If you have an idea of those kind of hosted service, it would be cool.  

**UPDATE**:

FastSpring is integrated with PayPal and is a hosted service though the cost model is percentage of revenue as opposed to monthly fees.
