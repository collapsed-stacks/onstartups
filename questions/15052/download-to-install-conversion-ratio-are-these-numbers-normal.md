Got to know about this forum through Jason Cohen blog. I actually just sent a similar email to Jason as well.

I have a bit of an issue that is proving to be very challenging and I thought of asking in here to see if I can get some insights.

I own a small software company the develops and sells consumer and professional backup software. I won't mention the name here as I don't want this post to seem like an advertising post.  I would mention however if the mods are ok with it.

So .. my challenge.

I have an issue right now where I invest money in banner ads on reputable sites ( i don't believe that there is any click-fraud) and I am only getting 15% that download the product to actually install. I have a relatively good tracking system that can track most of these.

As an example - if I get 100 downloads then I only get 15% of those downloads that actually install.

I also created a funnel for a particular campaign I ran -<strike> I am attaching it to this post.</strike>

Actually being new I'm not allowed to post images so here goes:

<em>
A 100,000 Banner Ad Campaign (Banner delivered 4.5% CTR)

Landing Page Visitors > 4574

17% of Landing Page Visitors clicked download button (781)

15% that clicked download button actually installed (114)

39% that installed actually configured the product (3 step configuration wizard)

37% are still reported to be running after 7 days

Actual Sales - 3 Units!
</em>

My question is: Is this type of conversion rate 'normal'? I find it hard to understand how-come so many people decide to download but then do not even try to install the product.

We don't have any reports from customers of having installation problems (we track installs by automatically opening a getting started page once the product installs successfully).

I am destroying myself thinking about this stuff .. I would love some insights if possible.

First- **how** are your measuring the number of actual downloads? Your web site log files will often show a single download as if it was several separate download attempts. In other words, your web logs might show 5 downloads, but those "downloads" actually all consitute a **single** download button click by your customer.

Second, how do you know the log files are reporting **complete** downloads, and not partial downloads *(which can never be installed)*.

Third, how do you know the customer has not clicked on the download button **several** times in quick succession?

Finally, the point of your web site should be to sell your product right then and there, not to encourage people to download a trial version and maybe install it later. This will change your statistics to:

*A 100,000 Banner Ad Campaign (Banner delivered 4.5% CTR)*

*Landing Page Visitors > 4574*

*0.5% of Landing Page Visitors clicked the buy button (23)*

*65% that clicked the buy button complete the purchase (15)*

*1 asks for a refund*

*Actual Sales - 14 Units!*

I have the same problem. But my numbers will shock you, as they shock me :-) For example - we are now running 3-4 PPD campaing on cnet, brothersoft, tucows etc. And our download - install ratio is 5% !!! How that can be? We are monitoring the installation proccess from it's first start. So if, supose, there is some error during the install we would see it. We use a standarnd ino isntaller. And the install - activate trial ratio is 21%. So the download - activate trial ratio is 1% or less !!! maybe you guys take a look at this mess :-) http://www.brothersoft.com/ppd/cybersafe-topsecret-497801.html How you understnad we can not have any issues with tracking downloads, 'cause the PPD sites do all the job. We can hardly imagine that mac users can dwonload from win section :-)

Gary E has some good points. I think there is a flaw in determining an actual download.

I don't know enough about crawlers, but are you sure these are actually people accessing the file: http://www.altaro.com/backup-downloadform-submit-oopsbackup.php ? 

Follow-up when they leave the optional email address. What is the percentage?

Have the install complete in two steps. Instead of having the entire 17 mb download all at once, download a small file < 1MB that initiates the downloading and installation of the rest of the application. 

Why does the backup-download.php have a link at the top back to itself? Too many download buttons.

I had to hunt down your System Requirements to find out that it only works on Windows. Are you getting false downloads from Apple users?

If these are  C2B then a good funnel gets 2% to 6% conversion from landing page.  So a bit low at first glance.  But I just noticed that you are getting 2.6% from those that actually installed.  Appears that you has some funnel issues that you can improve on and I really like Gary's feedback on a quick call to action.  The banner ads you are doing might not be focused properly either though 4.5% seems like a good copy conversion rate.  

Luck.
