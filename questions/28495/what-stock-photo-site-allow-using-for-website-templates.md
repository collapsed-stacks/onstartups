I'm tending to use some stockphotos to sell (like RocketTheme, ThemeForest). But I'm not sure what stock photo service is the best in this case that allow me using photos for templates. Could you give me some recommendations? Thank you.

<p>The standard royalty free license does not allow you to use the images for resale.</p>

<p>Many places usually offer you special licenses for that.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com" rel="nofollow">iStockPhoto</a>'s extended license, that is more expensive, but allows use in templates.</p>

I use this:
http://www.istockphoto.com

and that:
http://de.fotolia.com/

Both services allow you do buy images for reproduction (please read the copyright info on each image you would like to purchase)
