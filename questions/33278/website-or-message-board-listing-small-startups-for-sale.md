I have a startup (that I've posted about before), and I'd like to sell it for a few thousand dollars.  Someone could buy it to take the product that I've developed and do something with it; someone could buy it as a "shell" (as it has a tax ID number, bank account, incorporation and various qualifications in various states, website, etc.) and do something with it.

Is there a website or message board that would be a good place to advertise it for sale?

Thank you!
