What does these mean in plain English, guessing the best way to describe it is by giving theoretical numbers for best worst case instances, though that's just my thought - I'll leave it up to you to decided how to explain it:

> The terms? $150,000 in convertible
> debt. With no cap and no discount. If
> you’re an investor you know exactly
> what that means and you just shuddered
> a little. Those aren’t terms that most
> angels can match.
> 
> If you’re not an investor, here’s what
> it means. Yuri and SV Angel just
> offered to loan each company $150,000.
> That loan will convert if/when the
> company raises a proper angel or
> venture capital round at the same
> valuation that’s set in that round.
> Most convertible debt has a valuation
> ceiling and also gets a discount on
> conversion. This debt doesn’t.

<p>A convertible note is a loan with the right to convert that loan to equity later on.  One of the reasons it is used by startups and their investors:</p>

<ul>
<li>No need to come to an agreement at a valuation - this is good because valuations can be very hard to do early on.  It also removes some distraction and overhead this early to focus on other things.  The valuation is deferred until another investment round.  </li>
</ul>

<p>The discount would be the preferential price that the investor who made the convertible loan would get at the time of a new financing round.  This is done to acknowledge that the earlier investors took more risk and should get a return on that.  Thus the original investor (the one converting the loan to equity) pays less for the shares at that point than the others who buy in at that round.  </p>

<p>In the example you gave above - the early investor is betting that the quality of the startup is so good that they ust want to get in at the first valuation and don't need/want discount for their early loan.</p>

<p>A cap is the maximum valuation the lender/original investor will pay for equity.  So for example if the company was valued at $100M at the subsequent round of funding and the convertible debt had a cap of $10M the original investor buys equity at 10M, not 100M</p>
