I am trying to understand the two different tax-system: Pay as you Go and Pay as you Earn. What is the difference between the two?

They are the same thing: tax taken out of your pay throughout the year. PAYE was the name before the GST was introduced on 30 June 2000. Now it's called PAYG. Go figure!

This information is relevant to people paying tax in AUSTRALIA.
