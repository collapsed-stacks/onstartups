## Is my role as non technical guy valuable enough in this case?

How do I approach this situation? I m a non-technical guy, but I want to set up a very basic search engine which would search for data from a MYSQL database of data collected by us.The data is limited to a certain field. 

I realise that a huge majority of the work required for something like this is technical. So, how do I go about trying to execute this idea? I know ideas are worthless without having the ability to execute it. 

I am willing to provide the entire capital and cover all costs, and handle the business aspect of the business (the business would require a certain amount of offline work to develop and grow). Would someone be willing to partner up with me in such a scenario? If so, would I have to give the other person majority stake, or does my capital infusion and business development work help balance that out? Also, the site would obviously need constant work on it to keep it updated and running well.

You mention that you will provide all capital to cover costs. That puts you in a strong position to get what you need and I see you have two choices:

- use capital to buy technical resource to implement your idea, this could be by employing someone at the market rate or by contracting the work to a developer/agency. As you mention that there will be ongoing work you are more likely to look to an employee/partner scenario. If you are paying market rate for a developer you need only offer a small amount of shares (if you choose to do so)
- find a partner that will work for a reduced wage in exchange for a share of the company. The amount you share would be dependent on the reduction in pay, the amount of work they do of the total work required to launch your business and the amount of engagement/partnership you want from them.

If you are supplying the capital and have very much needed expertise in actually getting people to use your service (marketing etc), there is no way you should be handing over the majority of the company.

**If you are providing all the capital then it's your business** and you can do what you want.  Now depending on how technical the solution is you get to choose the way forwards.  It may be completely feasible to hire a developer at market rates to do the work you need.  In which case you won't have to hand over any of your business.

The reasons for handing over a share of your business could be:

- you want a senior techie guy that you otherwise cannot afford
- you want a partner/co-founder in the business to help make decisions

If neither of those resonates then you're probably better off just hiring a developer to do the work for you.  He/she isn't going to care too much if you are techy or not - they just get paid to do what you want.
