We are going to start creating an iPhone app prototype with Keynotopia.com. The app will be an add-on to our website which is currently in dev. 

Once the app prototype is complete, what are the next steps/options we should be looking at?

<p>Seek validation of your current approach. This could be done through user interviews, gaining respected investment or hitting some sort of objective metrics (X views of prototype maybe?).</p>

There's only three reasonable steps after you complete your prototype:

 1. Show your new features for a small audience to test them until the features are polished enough or you choose to discard them;
 2. Publish them for all your public;
 3. Return to step 1 if you have more ideas.

### Customer Validation ###

----------


1. Gather some good **contact points** to your target audience - bloggers, forums, usergroups etc. Make sure you are targeting the right users
 
2. Demonstrate your prototype and collect as much **feedback** as possible
 
3. **Analyze** and distill the feedback you've got and **adapt** your product to emphasize the features your audience liked and cut the ones they didn't.

Then just repeat this process until you can confidently say that you are in touch with the needs of your target audience.
