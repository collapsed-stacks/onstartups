I am interested in buying a low investment business in a European city capable of (modestly) supporting one full time person. Cafe, retail or service businesses are all possibile targets. I'm at an early stage, before settling on budget, specific business type and such. I'd like to get educated on the market before settling on these. Where/How is this information. 

I got the impression that business brokers mostly facilitate larger (â‚¬250k+) sales and listings on "open air" websites al la residential property do do not seem to be common. 

I suppose this is two questions that I expected to have the same answer:

    1 - How do I research this market
    2 - How do I find businesses to buy
