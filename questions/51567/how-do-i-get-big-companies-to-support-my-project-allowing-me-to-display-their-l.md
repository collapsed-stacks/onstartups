<p>I'm developing a website to promote a project my company wants to do over the next 6 months. My organization works with children &amp; adolescents. We would like to add logos at the bottom of our website of other companies that share in our goals. The number one goal is supporting healthy growth &amp; development in our communities. And, strengthen the lives of children, young adults, families and communities. How do I get companies like Target, Walmart, etc... to grant me permission to place their logos on my site to showing support in our cause? Thanks </p>

<p>They are not sponsors or partners until they agree to be so. For that you should contact them directly with a proposition, just like any other sponsorship/partnership request. If you don't have contacts at these companies, expect it to be a long process with lots of "no" answers - if you get answers at all.</p>
