## 70/30 Commission... Do I show pre-split revenue or post-split revenue to Customers?

We have a startup that allows users to sell things. We take a 30% cut of their revenue. My question is- do we show them the full revenue amount (100% before the split) in their dashboard, or de we go ahead and show the post-split amount (70% of the sale).

They will get a check in the mail for their sales... If we show 100% everywhere, the check will be a different amount- 70% of their billed revenue, which could cause confusion. If we show 70% everywhere, it could be confusing in that they think they just sold a $75 product, why is my revenue only showing $52.50?

We've thought of showing the pre and post split amount everywhere like:

Amount/ (You keep)

$75.00/ **$52.50**


We don't want to constantly remind the customer of the 30% they're spending on our service, but don't see any other transparent way to handle it.

Anyone have any best practices on how to handle this?

End of the day .. you need to manage customers expectation.. show me a $100 and I expect $100... that's human nature.

I like the the Envato marketplaces, they do a GREAT job or showing how much has been sold Vs how much you've made as an author. 99% of the time it's how much you've made. However, You can still see the original amounts and the commission % in the reporting section.
