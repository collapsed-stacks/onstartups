I currently own a startup and we are planning on building some niche / specialized software projects built around our public api and some of our source code / libraries. So basically, the really hard / heavy lifting stuff is done an exposed through our libraries and APIs and we just need some front end application / basic number crunching and user interface stuff.

I am looking for resources, books, blogs, advice etc on where to start and how to manage the outsourced projects from start to finish. 

As a point of reference these projects will be around the 1 man month development time.

I would recommend Elance.com

There, you're able to search a large database of freelance software engineers and reputable companies. There are user reviews, portfolios, rankings.

If I remember correctly, you can also set up milestones for the engineer to complete and you can pay them at certain milestones and track their progress.

Good luck!
