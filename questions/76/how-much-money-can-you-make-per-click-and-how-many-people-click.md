Bottom line, you won't make much. 
Most realize that the cost of advertising (poorer user experience, less real estate, impression it leaves with your users - you are monetizing them) outweighs the cents on the dollar you'll make from Google Adsense.  Don't get me wrong, Google Adsense works, and you'll make some money, but not a alot unless you have millions of page vies per month and you put up the ads in such a way that they will be clicked (adding another downside of getting folks of your site).  

If you really want ads; you a service like Pubmatic or Rubicon which will automatically manage and optimize a few ad networks.  You won't make much more but then you won't have to ask yourself if you could be doing more either.

This depends a lot on what kind of a crowd your site attracts. I've seen revenue per thousand impressions be anything between $0.07 - $1.00 for sites where AdSense/other display network is just slapped on, but I would suspect $15.00+ for certain niches like dating, travel etc.

It can be as high as $75 per click in some niches.  But those are very rare, and obviously very competitive.

For IT and programming related stuff, it's less than $5.

An average CTR (click through rate) is about 1.5%. But depending on what sort of advertising you've got displayed (which will depend on both your site and your visitors) the amount you'll earn per thousand daily impressions can vary wildly.

You could use [an Adsense Calculator](http://www.calculatorslive.com/Google-Adsense-Revenue-Estimate-Calculator.aspx) to get a better idea of what you'll earn based on sector and page impressions per day.
