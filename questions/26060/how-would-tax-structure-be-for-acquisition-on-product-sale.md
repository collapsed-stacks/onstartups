My company has an existing loss at this point.  I sell the (one-off) product that the company produced and the purchase price exceeds the loss.

Do I just pay tax on the difference?

Are you mixing asset acquisition and buying a company versus buying a product?  <br>

Sales of a good can generate two types of taxes - a usage or sales tax and then income taxes.  (this is for USA other taxes like VAT exist for Europe)
