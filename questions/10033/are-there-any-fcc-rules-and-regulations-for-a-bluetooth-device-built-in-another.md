Are there any FCC rules and regulations for a bluetooth device built in another country but schematics and designs belonging to the company here in the US? Is there some kind of inspection one must go thru for new EE designs?

Are you selling or using the device(s) in the US? If so they **must** meet FCC wireless regulations. See: http://wireless.fcc.gov/index.htm?job=rules_and_regulations

FCC rules for Bluetooth modules and RF exposure are located here:
