Context: I started a SAAS based platform for small and medium sized companies around a year back. To save some time I intentionally took this underpaid job close to my home. I have  successfully completed private BETA of the product for selected customers and planning for public BETA with a month trial period. Unfortunately, I am running out of funds for this phase of the project and I am thinking of taking a new job as contractor so that I can continue to bootstrap.

Question: I acquired lot of skills as part of this startup and I am wondering whether I need to mention this in my resume? I am hesitant because a potential employer might think I am focused more on my startup than on my new job or he might think this new job might temporary engagement from me.

Any advice? As always your advice is greatly appreciated.

You seem to want everything to be perfect. You want a "VP of Architecture" role without the appropriate level of commitment to that role. So don't go for that kind of gig. Go for the kind of gig that matches your commitment level. Then the rest will be a non-issue.

I think you should be honest about what you've been doing for the past year. Since you're looking to be a contractor which usually is billed hourly there shouldn't be as much of a conflict as long as you are honest about your time.

Side projects for developers are common. There are many reasons why some developers are not productive. Your site shows what you have to offer. Just make a genuine effort in your job. If an employer is overly concerned, you may not want to work for them anyway.

So you educated yourself with new technologies in nights and weekends. To an employer that would only mean good things -- means you're a real "geek". you love what you do and you're probably good at it. You are making an effort to educate yourself and broaden your technical horizon. I'd hire you.

I definitely agree with being honest - you don't need to throw yourself under the bus, but no client wants to feel like they are being taken advantage of or lied to.

If a concern for a potential client is that you aren't devoted to his/her project or that you won't see it to completion I would suggest getting creative with your billing scheme.  Consider breaking up payments into milestones where larger percentages of the job are paid out later in the development process.  This can serve as a sign of good faith to the client and also potentially a motivator to get projects done in a timely manner.

I think the real question is, how do you apply for a job knowing it's meant to support you temporarily while your startup takes hold? In that case, it seems that you should be trying to consult on the side for your bootstrapping vs finding salaried employment. You have new skills now that could be marketable, and it seems those skills should be flexed as often as possible so that you can solidify your startup. Look for contracts that are short and relevant to your startup if possible, that way you have an opportunity to add to your network, your potential staff and even your startup's service/product.

I had two options, work as senior technology executive Or work as Senior Software engineer. 

1. Senior Tech executive: Pros: Good for career, make more money. Cons: don't have time.
2. Senior Engineer: Pros: Enough time to concentrate on project, you are hands-on, high degree of motivation as you have only this option to succeed in life :). Cons: Not great money, Not good for career.

I decided to go with option 1, I spend around 2 hours  a day, partnered with another firm for development with equity and contribute partly to the salaries of the programmers. In between, I take a month break to focus on product.
