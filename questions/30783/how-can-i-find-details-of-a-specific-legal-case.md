I know this isn't entirely on topic but is the closest Stack Exchange website I could possibly find for this type of question...

I'm trying to find the details of a specific legal case (Aqua Connect v. Code Rebel LLC et al), as shown here: http://www.law360.com/cases/4e1f6ebaca42e20b75000002

Are there any open access websites where I can find this information?
