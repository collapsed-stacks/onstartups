I am attempting to create books for a small non-profit where we have a member base who pay a monthly membership due.

I have thought about creating an accounts receivable for each member that would invoice them each month. The dues are to be paid on the 15th of each month for the next month starting on the first (so roughly 15 days before the month they are for). Some members use a PAD (pre-authorized deposit) which is automatically withdrawn on that day. Some members also have extra money on those PADs for a donation.

Is there a better way to handle these dues and donations? We can't afford a bookkeeper or accountant but need a way to keep books for auditing purposes.

Thanks for any advice you are willing to offer.

EDIT:

Does anyone know of accounting software (open source preferably) that has a web interface to bring up reports for the membership at large? Even something that has a personal balance for each member saying whether they have outstanding dues or not.

In my experience, once you have the account ledger structure set up (ie. how to split up income/expense/tracking accounts, and understand where to put what activities), then tracking the money itself is straightforward. Maybe you can ask around for a local accountant who'd be willing to help you set up a basic structure for free (given its a non-profit)?

When it comes down to tracking the money/balances etc. this is as simple or as complex as you want to make it. You can track things in Excel or some free accounting software like http://www.gnucash.org/ quite simply.
