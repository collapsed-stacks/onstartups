It would seem companies would be unhappy about being bashed in the lists, and it seems that, this being the States, that they would sue in order to drive them out of business.

A few points:

Angies List HAS been involved in legal actions against members who have posted bad reviews. There was a case of a home remodeling contractor in the Washington, DC area who sued some past customers who posted reviews of his work on Angies List. 

Secondly, freedom of speech, etc gets quoted a lot. It guarantees NOTHING when it comes to civil lawsuits. Sure, government will allow you to say pretty much anything. It's your fellow citizen who can afford an attorney to force you to shut up by attributing destructive intentions to your expressed opinions. As stated by "Maple_shaft", proceedings to shut down online comments and to muzzle a reviewer happen all the time. The site operator is expected to cooperate by responding to legal process when identities of "John Does" are requested. 

See my blog for an example case: http://donwallacewriting.com/silencingcritics

I know your question was - how the site operator can avoid legal action. A possible answer (and I am NOT a lawyer) - by being transparent, by supplying user identities on demand, and by complying with take down orders. End users probably can't avoid the possibility of legal action except by not posting,and if they do post, using all available means (free email accounts, TOR, etc) to avoid identification.

Freedom of speech, of the press, of association, of assembly and petition -- this set of guarantees, protected by the First Amendment, comprises what is known as freedom of expression.

The Supreme Court has written that this freedom is "the matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom."
