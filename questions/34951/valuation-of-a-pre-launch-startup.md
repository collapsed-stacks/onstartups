I would like to ask, if there any guide available on how to valuate your start up even before you launch you product?

I am in negotiation with some investors and really have no idea how to valuate my product when I have no existing user base, no revenue and quite frankly no direct competitor to compare my start-up to.

All the help is much appreciated.

I think I just answered this as an bonus freebie in your other question at http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/34952/how-to-create-a-well-structured-term-sheet

Mind reader :)
