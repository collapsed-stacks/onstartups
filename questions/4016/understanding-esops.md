We would like to introduce ESOP plan for our employees. However, I do not understand the tax implications of it for employees as well as the company. Any pointers to simple explanations of ESOP plans and their tax implications in the Indian law context would be very helpful.

You should bring in an accountant or attorney experienced in these matters if you don't feel comfortable doing them yourself.  Giving them bad advice is worse than none at all.

If you want to maximize this person's value without having to pay them again and again for the same information, ask them to write something up for your employees.  Use this as a standard handout when a new person comes on board.
