<p>I am in process of starting new training company and also want to my students to take exams at my own center. For this I would like to become test Center for Prometric and Others.</p>

<p>I have seen the website of Pro-metric and got idea on requirements and eligibility, But I am not sure on what would be the business models and whether this is profitable business.</p>

<p>I would like your suggestions and any real time experiences.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Ni </p>
