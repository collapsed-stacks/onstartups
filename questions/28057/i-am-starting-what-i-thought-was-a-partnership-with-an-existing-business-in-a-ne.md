I bring a skillset and experience they do not have.

We discussed terms and were set on a split of revenue and equity. We went to for licensing and signing of the lease and ran into some issues. As this would be a new LLC the operating costs rise dramatically as we can no longer run under the same insurance umbrella and the leasing company for the office wants to have everyone personally liable for the lease as it is a new company. On the other hand to run it under the same name but as a branch location, this would be eliminated and the expenses drop dramatically. This would prevent me from being able to have an equity stake in the company at this time.

My question is, can I protect my self via an employment contract or by other means to prevent them from letting me go after i build the business? How can i still keep some sort of stake in it? They compensation plan and my split of revenue has not changed. The point of me giving my sweat equity is to have my own business or a partnership.

If it's a different set of partners, different physical location, etc. then it should probably be it's own legal entity. Having people personally responsible for businesses leases is quite common. Had to do it for all of mine. Probably worth the extra expense and hassle to have the paperwork clean and you as an owner documented.  Versus some odd situation they would have to set up for you to get profit sharing or some pseudo ownership related to the other persons primary business.
