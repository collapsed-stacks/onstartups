## Should startups attract only new customer or should they not hesitate in stealing customers from existing players?

I am working on a startup and am currently in beta. Basically I have been looking for customer feedback and continuously improving the product from the feedback I collect. 

So far I have stayed under radar. Existing companies don't know how i am changing the game. I have done this by not stealing any of their customers and only signing up new customers.

My questions is should i continue to ignore the customers I can steal or should i start stealing. 

My fear is that since my product is still not stable and I don't have enough momentum, existing companies will easily copy what I have and push me out.

Please advice

Offer a quality product and don't lie about it, so you don't have to feel like you're stealing. 

If someone can not only copy/reverse engineer your app, but maintain and enhance it as well as you can and as fast as you can for a similar cost, I doubt waiting a few months will make a difference. You can't hide forever.
