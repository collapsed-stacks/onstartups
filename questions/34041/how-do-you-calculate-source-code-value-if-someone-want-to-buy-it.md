For example, for $1000 product, how much is the source code value ?

You can **not** determine the value of your source code by the price you sell it for.

Source code value is based on what the product is **worth** to the person buying it. This worth varies based on things like:

 1. How badly does the buyer need the source code? *(If they need it in a hurry, it is worth more than if they need it some time from now.)*
 2. How much would it cost them to code this product on their own? *(How many hours did it take you to write and test this software?)*
 3. How hard would it be for them to verify their own software works correctly. *(The harder it is to verify, the more value there is to your tested version.)*
 4. How well do you negotiate and how well do they negotiate? *(Software source code, like a new car, doesn't typically sell for the asking price. The price is negotiated.)*
 5. How much support is included with the purchase of the source code?
 6. How much work will have to go to the lawyers to hammer out a contract? *(Obviously the sale price must pay for the cost of writing up a legal agreement.)*

<p>The simplest way to set up a cost/effort estimate (which would ultimately lead to a value calculation) is to use the CoCoMo or the Constructive Cost Model. Though there are various methods to calculate the price of a source code, I prefer the CoCoMo model.</p>

Apart from putting the values from the buyer perspective as enumerated by Gary, you need to calculate your opportunity cost as well.

If you are selling a piece for $1000 and there is a market for 10 units in a month, you make $10,000. You can take a cut say 20% for the maintenance of your website and other supports. This is profit lost by you. This should be calculated in a somewhat conservative manner and very optimistic manner. Typically you should account for 24 months of profit lost in such cases.

It may so happen, that you have spent $20000 worth of effort on the product, and ultimately fees that it is not worth that much, you have to take a call based on lost profit basis.

It is better to create a spreadsheet with all the cost, possible profit and other scenario. This will give you a clarity and help you in taking a decision.
