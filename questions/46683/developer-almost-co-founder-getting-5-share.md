Two friends had an idea, they were kinda working on it for few months then invited me for 5% of the share and I joined them. At that point when I joined we had nothing really - just an idea and a business plan in development. I've already spend 6 months now developing the product for free because in the start I believed in it and we almost had investors (one investor was really interested). But from then on we had a lot of "interested" investors but no one actually did invest. I was promised 5% share in the start but now I'm thinking about if all that free work for almost half a year is worth it.

We did launch the product actually, and we're getting traction slowly. But I had a job which payed well (but was kinda dull). And now I'm spending my own savings for 5% that some day may be worth something.

Should I request bigger share, wait a bit longer or leave maybe? I can't decide. I really think this could turn into something great but I don't think I'll still be motivated by that 5% in few upcoming months.

Any thought on my situation?

<p>You have skills. They have ideas. No one has money. </p>

<p>I think that the <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/22791/developer-offered-share-in-small-startup-company-in-return-for-large-rate-reduc/46681#46681">referenced post</a> really does a good job of spelling out the economic gains / risks inherent in these sort of arrangement. </p>

<p>If you bored at your current job and want to expand your skills with minimal risk with (however small) potential upside, moonlighting in a startup provides an outlet to scratch that itch.  </p>

<p>The problem with such arrangements comes when the "proof of concept" gains traction and becomes a business: You've already priced yourself at a low level (free) and the perceived value you provided to make the POC a success is assumed as part of the original deal. Most concepts never survive first contact with customers. </p>

<p>Renegotiating is an option, but the burger is already eaten: Now the focus moves to whether you are the right person to grow the product. The next hamburger.</p>

<p>One way to break this cycle is to upfront negotiate agreements where revenue share is taken in consideration. Or <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/a/23326/2380">reimbursement of IOUs</a> upon funding.  Or bonus based on achieving specific milestones. Or buyout / separation clauses.</p>

<p>In short, negotiating an agreement where your effort has an actual value associated with it. Depending on the partner / opportunity / challenge the parameters will change. It's up to you and your negotiation skills to define such value and protect your interests. </p>
