The question came to mind when I went to file for the business which will be an LLC in Florida.  One of the questions that came up was the address in which I will be conducting business.  On the other side, once a find a place to rent, won't they want the legal entity that will be doing the renting?  Does it matter that the that address on the filing forms match with the entity who is renting the property.

As a side question, if happen to move to a different location, who do I need to let know?

The procedure is legally the same as relocating your HQ: you just need to file the paperwork for the change of address (whatever is appropriate in your locality).

However, you still need to check with the local authorities whether you can file the original registration with a residential address as some jurisdiction don't allow businesses to be registered in areas with residential zoning or require additional paperwork.
