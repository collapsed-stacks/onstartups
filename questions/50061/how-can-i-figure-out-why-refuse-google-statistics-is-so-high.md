I have an educational application, and it gains some little traffic from Chrome Web Store and Facebook App listing.

But Google Analytic says, that 'refuse' is extremely high - 70%-90%.

Refuse - is when User closes page without browsing anything else. Spends nearly 1-2 seconds on site.

And how can I figure out, why they are leaving?

1) They don't need product?
2) They don't like design?
3) They were expecting native language interface (there are visitors from Japan, India, etc)

I have the same problem with my lab tests interpreter, but in my situation is explicable considering that people are interested in just one medical test. However, your site might have this problem because either is not free or just because people can't find the item that interest them.

I guess what you need might be sampling? 

If it is possible just invite some of your friends to visit your site and hopefully, they will give you insights you're looking for. Regarding question 1 and 2, this might be the only approach you have.

For question 3, you can dig into your Google Analytics data, check out the region analysis and you should be able to decide if this is the case.

<p>If they leave so quickly it is probably <strong>one of these reasons</strong>: </p>

<p>a) as you suggest, <strong>they don't like the design of the webpage</strong> (too amateuristic, too cheap-looking, too-empty,...)</p>

<p>b) they realize quickly that <strong>the website doesn't contain the information they came for</strong></p>

<p><strong>Put yourself at their place</strong> (or as you are not objective, ask someone else to do it) and try to find the reason why they leave immediately. <strong>And think also</strong> (in the other way) <strong>about the reasons that make YOU leave other websites already after the first page seen.</strong></p>

<p>Some other remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>concerning language</strong>: if they come from the google store - is that store in their language (and what about the app description?) If the app description is in English and they "click" anyway, then lhe language is probably not the reason to leave</li>
<li>in Google Analytics, <strong>check the "entrance page"</strong> - it's mostly the frontpage? If not, what page? <strong>You should concentrate on that page as it causes the leaves</strong></li>
<li>check the <strong>adequacy between the place the visitors come from</strong> (google store, other websites, search engines) <strong>and the entrance page</strong>. If you want to "keep" them on the website, <strong>they must see the info they expect to see when coming!</strong> This is a must. For that reason, you should also avoid the "black SEO" techniques. It can bring you traffic, but it is an useless traffic.</li>
</ul>
