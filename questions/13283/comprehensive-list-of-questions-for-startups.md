There are plenty of "10 questions" for startups after a google search, but do you have a list of questions that is categorized as sales/marketing/pr/owner etc? Each of these areas have about 10 or so questions to consider to solidify the product.

I came across one article/page a while ago, but I am not sure if this exists anymore.

<p>and welcome to this site! :-)</p>

<p>I take the gist of your question to be "the complete check-list of things I should plan/investigate for my startup". I agree that would be great to have -- a kind of guide to support the upcoming entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't think that there is a check-list that is complete or comprehensive. It would depend on the market the startup is in, the capitalization strategy, and the entrepreneurs aspirations and dreams. If someone wrote such a check-list, it could bring a false sense of security.</p>

<p>Take a look at business mentorship programmes instead? A human advisor can better adapt to the specifics of your startup, and help you forward. The American <a href="http://www.score.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">SCORE</a> organization could be one example of the kind of programme I'm thinking about.</p>
