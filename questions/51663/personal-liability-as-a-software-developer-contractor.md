<p>I refused to sign a contract with my Client because of personal liability clause. But my Client insists that it's a common practice and it's ok. I'm in doubts, is it really a common practice? Here's the clause:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shall have personal liability for any loss, liability or costs (including reasonable 
  legal costs) incurred by Company in connection with the Services and shall maintain 
  in force during the period of this agreement adequate insurance cover (INCLUDING 
  workersâ€™ compensation insurance) with reputable insurers acceptable to Company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Services</code> are defined as <code>Development of XXX Software</code></p>

<p>The Client is an Australian Company, I'm independent contractor without LLC.</p>
