I created a social networking site that connects models with talent.  It has 1,500 members and growing.  The problem:  I know NO ONE in the talent/model industry, and I believe it is a great product.  I have tried to reaching out to people on linkedin, known agency websites, etc, but to no avail.

I am not trying to sell them a service.  I literally just need guidance from someone in in the industry.  How I got involved is a typical situation where one person has idea, I develop the idea full blown, other person turns out to be basically useless.  That one person knew the industry.

I know there is a need for this site, and have received a lot of great feedback, but I can't find a high level person in the industry that can give me sound advice or connect me with the right people.

Anybody know how I can solve this?

Maybe talent agents "in the industry" find your product to be competitive with their business model. They have a vested interest in locking your out (ignoring you)... Don't they?

Maybe look at other sites with similar concepts and see how they are doing it.

For example: http://www.proplayerconnect.com/ (pro sports).

That site offers something for both the agents and the players, and so both sides find value in it.

If you develop a vibrant enough community, with models that are working as some of the members, you will probably find it easier to get in touch with insiders.

You also may have insiders, if you have some members that are models. It may be in their interest to help you out, if they feel they are getting something of value from your site, so you may have a message asking for some help.

If your members aren't interested in helping you that may be a warning about the usefulness of your site, and you may need to adjust.
