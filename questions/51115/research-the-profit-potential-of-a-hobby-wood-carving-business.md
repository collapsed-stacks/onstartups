<p>I am a software developer and i wish to start a side business as a hobby wood carver.
What is the best way to go about researching the profit potential of those idea? i was thinking:<br>
1. go on amazon.com and see the products in woodcarving for sale and at what price they are selling<br>
2. gather stats from amazon as to how many have actually sold in the past year within a given price range.<br>
3.estimate how many pieces it is possible to make and sell given my  time constraints.<br>
4. arrive at some rough figure based on the above 3.  </p>

<p>This is very rough, and i just wanted to ask how i can improve on this.</p>

<p>You want to arrive at a profit forecast, which is revenue minus expenses. your approach to gauge revenue is a start, but you're missing all the expenses. </p>

<p>Not being 100% versed in the wood carving industry, I will assume that the hand-carved pieces you are focused on are more one-of-a-kind and perhaps amazon isn't the best place to look for comps. If it's not one-of-a-kind you're going to be competing with firms that perhaps have already achieved the economies of scale needed to produce at a low enough cost to offer goods to a larger market at a fair price (probably not hand-carved).  so #1 might give you more mass-market type information. #2 might tell you the customer's willingness to pay for similar products. But I'd argue you're looking perhaps in the wrong place.</p>

<p>Your business sounds more like an art business to me, in which case prices are all over the place depending on what you're creating and how awesome a potential buyer finds it to be. Are your pieces functional or display art? Having a few friends who call themselves artists, I can tell you that it's a lot of work to sell pieces and make a real living at it... But if it's side hobby that you enjoy, and you can make a little scratch here and there - go for it! Don't waste your time figuring out the profit potential :)</p>
