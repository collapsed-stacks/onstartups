Any recommendation? Is sale a process to deliver comfort which is declared in the book "E-myth revisited"?

Assuming you're talking about B2B, the best sales book I ever read is hands down Jill Conrath's Selling to Big Companies.  

You can get your motivational guys like the little Red Book of Sales, etc....but really if you need to know how to sell read Conrath, even if your clients are big companies.

<p>In addition of the Emilie suggestion which is one of the top choice, please consider <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0786303158" rel="nofollow">Solution Selling</a>. The most powerful sales technique I know.</p>

<p>It works with any type of customer. The technique is described <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_selling" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>What I like in the technique is that it focus its efforts on solving a customer problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Solution selling is a special approach to sales. Rather than just promoting an existing product, the salesperson focuses on the customer's pain(s) and addresses the issue with his or her offerings (product and services). The resolution of the pain is what constitutes a true "solution". A limitation of this approach is that not all customers buy to address a "pain", not every need is a problem needing a solution.</p>

<p>If your are selling a very new product in a new market, I suggest your this book in addition of the other suggestion. The concepts are similar, but here it focuses you on the attributes of your product: it's new &amp; unknown.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1906465266" rel="nofollow">Why Killer Products Don't Sell</a></strong> more info on the book <a href="http://www.killer-products.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
