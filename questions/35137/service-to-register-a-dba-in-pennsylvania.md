I have a sole proprietorship registered in Pennsylvania and I need to register a DBA for it.

I am looking for a service that might be able to do this for me.  I've looked at possibly using [Legal Zoom](http://www.legalzoom.com) but I haven't found them to be able to do a DBA on an existing corporation...

Lawyers that I have used to incorporate the business wanted too much in my opinion

So are there services that would be able to do this for me for a reasonable amount of money?

You can do it for $70 directly via the Pennsylvania Secretary of State. The form and instructions are here:

Lawyers will charge you up the wazoo to fill out this simple form. I'd charge slightly less :D
