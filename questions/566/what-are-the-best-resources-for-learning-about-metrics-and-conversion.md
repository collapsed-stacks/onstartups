I learned by doing. I had projects I was passionate about (a Linux website, later wrote a book) and put them to market. As problems arose (i.e. no sales, high bounce rates) I queried the mighty Goog for ideas and solutions. The search results introduced me to new concepts and terminology that I followed up on, learned and implemented.

Sorry for the folksy wisdom. My advice may not be sexy, but it worked for me.

Given the importance of achieving product/market fit - I am fan of this post: http://startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/ and in particular the quote "achieving product/market fit requires at least 40% of users saying they would be 'very disappointed' without your product".

Although you may already be aware of them, I think you'll like the info on http://www.marketingexperiments.com and http://www.marketingsherpa.com. May not have the number-crunching you're looking for, but overall great data.

Read a lot but you will only learn when you experiment. Put aside a fixed budget that and spend it equally on all your different marketing channels. 

There is no substitute for real experience.
