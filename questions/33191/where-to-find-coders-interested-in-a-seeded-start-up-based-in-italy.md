We are 3 partners and friends based in Milan, Italy, who started a crowdsourcing site which allows academics to work on short-term assignments. 

We launched in March of this year, and managed to get a small funding (â‚¬55k) and grew the platform to ~1,600 academic users. We generated our first revenue and now want to take it to the "next level"; now here is the catch: none of us are coders (we developed with a third-party company). To optimise the platform going forward, we really need 1 or 2 young enthusiastic coders who would like to get involved (should have known this before but we learn as we go :)); of course we would pay an appropriate salary and provide equity exposure if things work well.

Surfing the internet here in there, it seems relatively easy to find people in the US, London or even Berlin, but how do we find coders for a project in Milan?

Who do you need exactly? What are the requirements for the position? How do you plan on technically interviewing the candidates if you are not coders?

I was "a young enthusiastic coder" myself not so long ago, based in other EU country. When I searched for a job I just copied my (fairly niche) skills into google and one company based in... wait for it... Milan came up high in the results with a matching job offer :) I applied, took a 2 hour flight for an interview and got the job. But I see a serious problem with Milan for any "young enthusiastic coder" - the accommodation is expensive (plus you need to pay much more up front than in other countries), which directly translates into low standard of living. Unless you adjust the salaries accordingly, which in turn makes the point of developing in-house less attractive.

To sum up, getting the people to send in CVs is the least of your problems. I could easily place your job add for free on a high volume programming forum.

<p>Are any of your clients CS majors?  If you can find a happy client that can code your site, you might be able to convince them to invest time in a project they believe in (yours).</p>

<p>I am not form Italy, so I don't know the echo-system for programers, and I assume that you can do a better job finding their meetups, Quora, Facebook/LinkedIn groups and the likes...  Join these groups, post what you are looking for, and crowdsource your way into finding the talent you need.</p>

<p><a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/36429/stack-overflow-in-italian">These guys</a> might be more relevant then this community, as they are Italians.</p>

<p>Good luck with your site!</p>

I live in Genova. I found my current job -numerical programmer @ IIT- through indeed.com. I also applied to a few calls in www.monster.it.

I'm saying this because if I did try to find a job using these tools -and found it!- you may use them to hire. They work perfectly in Italy.

BTW, SE is read worldwide! you only need english.

A presto!
