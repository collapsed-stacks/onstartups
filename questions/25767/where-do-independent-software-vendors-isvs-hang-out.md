We are launching a new quoting software product targeted at ISVs, but don't know where to find them. I won't include the link as I don't want to seem spammy, but it's in my profile if you want to check it out. 

What's a good place to start for finding ISVs that might be interested in our software? What blogs do they read? Are there email lists out there? Where should we buy ads? What about trade shows? Other ideas?

Some sites software firms frequent include:

- JoelOnSoftware/Business of Software
- Assoc of Software Professionals (ASP)
- StackOverflow
- SoftwareCEO 

As you likely know, software firms don't take well to anything spammy, so please be sure you treat them the way they want to be treated in terms of how they are respected and  communicated with. Thank you.
