Young, three-person, bootstrapped enterprise-focused startup, finishing up work on our backend about to begin development of our API, frontend, and possibly Chatter/Yammer integration. Hopefully incorporating in Nevada in the next week or two.

Looking to launch our product in a few months, want to come up with a good six-month roadmap for what we need to accomplish.

Recognize that this is a somewhat open-ended question, and that one size probably does not fit all. But since none of us have done a startup before, does anybody have any advice for what should be included on this kind of roadmap to lauch?

Ideally, it would be something like this:

 1. Idea
 2. Customer validation
 3. Purchase promise from customer(s) (ideally contracts)
 4. Build MVP
 5. Customer feedback
 6. Iterate product
 7. Repeat 5 & 6 infinitely

 7.1 Keep selling

 7.2 Watch bank account grow

From the phrasing of your question, I assume that 2 & 3 haven't been done, in which case, make them a priority, then follow the rest of the list.
