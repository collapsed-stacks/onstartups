<p>There are three types of "giveaways":</p>

<ul>
<li>Contest (requires skill)</li>
<li>Sweepstakes (random chance of winning) </li>
<li>Lottery  you pay for a chance.  But something like a Facebook "like" is considered "Consideration" which <em>might</em> make it a Lottery, which may also require additional legal consideration.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that this line is very fine and tricky to navigate.</p>

<p>The biggest factor I have found is that everyone needs to be able to participate with little to no barrier. The safest thing to do is have something in the fine print, a website or a place they can go to enter the sweepstakes without having to jump through the hoop you are presenting.</p>

<p>So present the sweepstakes as you want, but in all the fine print you put something like - no purchase necessary, submit your entry at xyz.com/win ... yada yada.</p>

<p>I'm not a lawyer, but this is often what groups do and to my knowledge it is acceptable.</p>
