I was going through the online wizard in the IRS site to create an EIN and I got to a step where it asked me about my LLC Address. I have not filed my articles of organization yet so obviously I cancelled the wizard. But my questions are as follows:

 1. Should you put your registered agent's address? Or, is that only for the articles of organization?
 2. Would you put your home address? What if you live in an apartment?

**Note:** My work will initially not have a physical office, it will be virtual/remote from home or wherever I am, or even at client locations.

It should be your office/place of records address. Basically, that's the address that when the IRS comes to audit you it should be able to find you at (i.e.: your home). IRS doesn't care about the agent of service, its a requirement of the State (depending on the services provided by your agent, you can give agent's address as the mailing address though).

You shouldn't be filing for EIN if the entity doesn't exist. Why would you? It takes exactly 5 seconds to fill the form and get the EIN.
