Is there a way to determine the cost for a keyword by keyword and country?

<p>The <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" rel="nofollow">Google AdWords Keyword Tool</a> gives estimates of CPC (Cost per Click) to advertise on specific keywords. You can select "local" data and specify the country for the "local" stats.</p>

<p>You might need to register to get access to the full data. I recommend the tool by the way. It gives lots of insight into what people actually type in the google search box.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

Google has regions and put the words in it gives estimates for each word based on the filters.
