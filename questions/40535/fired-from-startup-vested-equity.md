I was recently terminated from a startup without cause, where I was one of several founders owning a decent percentage of stock. We also had an angel investor (incubator) in with us for a small percentage. All of our percentages are fully vested.

I feel totally cheated, but I'd like to hold on to my stock because I believe the startup will be very successful. But, the remaining members have been trying all sorts of games to get my percentage back. I am aware that dilution will happen as new investors come in, and I'm not really concerned about that as long as it's done 'fairly' i.e. everyone is diluted by the same amount.

1. Is it legal/likely/defensible in court for the other founders/Angel to collude and allocate a ton of shares and then offering everyone the option of buying them back?

2. Do new investors get turned off from investing in a startup such as this one, where one of the members (me) is out with a percentage, even though they have enough remaining for a majority? i..e 'the cap table is screwed up'

3. What other moves should I be aware of?

<p>Sorry to hear of your situation.</p>

<p>I'd be concerned about the company flipping its assets into a newco and wiping the slate clean - difficult with a pre-existing investor, but theoretically possible. </p>

<p>I'd also review the shareholders agreements regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag-along_right">drag along</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-Along_right">tag along</a> rights - they could be used for <a href="http://slashstar.com/Blog/Post/the-dark-side-of-drag-along-tag-along-rights">not so favorable purposes</a>.</p>

Where are you from? In many countries, there are lot of laws to protect shareholders from that kind of situations.

From there, you have three kind of strategies and much more if your are creative.

The first one is doing nothing. Put your energy is something more creative, why not by creating a new company.

The second one is the most common to my opinion: get your rights back. As I mentionned earlier, there are laws that can help you.

Finally, one action that I personally never saw in action is forcing the other shareholders to buy your shares. Again, law can help you in many countries. Be aware that there will be a valuation of the company. So you can win or lose, depending on how you will manage the case.
