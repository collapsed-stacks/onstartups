One of the most common answers to a product question revolves around defining your Minimal Viable Product (MVP). This is a product that just meets the needs of your customers.
MVP’s are a good discipline since many a product has died in development due to feature creep.
Take a look at the answers below to not only understand the MVP but how important it is to listen to and solve customers problems.

* [How Complete Should Your Product Be](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/12287/how-complete-do-you-make-your-product-before-launching-it): discusses the pros and cons of releasing too early and why customer feedback is vital.
* [Telling Customers What They Are Buying is an MVP](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/8416/minimum-viable-product-to-tell-customers-or-not-to-tell): stresses that customer feedback (like above) is really important and that you should respect your customers enough to tell them.
* [Cutting Features](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/5728/at-what-point-do-you-cut-features): this one has some great advice about a really touchy subject for most companies — when to cut and when to release.
* [Must Have or Nice to Have](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/1942/must-have-or-nice-to-have-how-do-you-know): dives into the classic debate about what customer really need and what they might just like.
* [Assessing Ideas](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/88/when-you-have-a-few-ideas-for-products-how-to-assess-them-and-make-a-move): discusses what happens when you have too many good ideas and how to pick out the potential winners.
* [Ways to Reject Feature Requests](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/5510/how-to-reject-feature-requests): has some great advice about improving your product and why it’s important to respect the feedback.
* [Choosing The Right Product Name](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/20824/choosing-the-right-name-for-a-new-product): the first thing a customer will judge you on is the name of your product. Getting the name right can take some time and effort but well worth it.
