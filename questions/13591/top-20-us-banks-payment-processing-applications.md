Are there any research papers showing what applications the top 20 US banks are using for their credit card / payment processing application?

For example, Citi is using Visionplus and so is GE. Wells Fargo is using CSC CAMES II, etc.

Thanks!

You ask a great question in light of the recently passed Dodd-Frank bill and its uncertain implications on the payment processing industry.  In an attempt to answer the answerable, if you're willing to pay for information, consider the Nilson Report, which is a leading source for in-depth research on this industry.  Alternatively, take a look at The StrawHecker Group, a consulting firm specializing in the payment processing industry, offering free research and industry reports. I provide both links below.
