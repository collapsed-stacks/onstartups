Are there any resources that provide the different steps needed to create a tech startup. Something along the line of:

* Set up legal structure 
* Choose a domain name
* Choose a hosting provider
* Set up Wordpress
* Purchase a logo and website theme
* ...

But with a lot more details for each step. 
My startup is US based, but most of this info is pretty much global.

I think the FIRST thing is to have something to sell, provide or promote... Your tools would need to match those goals.

<p><strong>A "I don't have to think, just follow this cookbook recipe" to startups obviously doesn't exist.</strong> Every startup is obviously unique.</p>

<p>That said, good advice can be more or less actionable right away.</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/users/346/bob-walsh">Bob Walsh's</a> <a href="http://startuptodo.com/session/new">StartUpToDo</a> has, among other things, a collection of relevant "cookbook recipes" for startups. The content is commercial, i.e. payment required.</p>

<p>Bob Walsh has also written a book with reasonably hands-on suggestions, called "<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1430219858">The Web Startup Success Guide</a>".</p>

<p>Rob Wallings has a <a href="http://www.startupbook.net/">startup guide for micro-entrepreneurs</a>, i.e. people who want to build a site, but not necessarily hire a team and grow large. It has practical advice on search engine marketing, website design, A/B testing and more.</p>

<p>Although Jesper Mortensen provided a great answer, I thought I would provide some additional input from Seth Godin's blog post, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/07/every-successful-case-is-a-special-case.html" rel="nofollow">Every successful case is a special case.</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's easy to dismiss strategies or
  plans or people who succeed by
  pointing out how they have something
  special, something irreproducible,
  some sort of advantage that makes
  their success special.</p>
  
  <p>Special as in, "not available to me."</p>
  
  <p>They went to Harvard, they're public,
  they're not public, they have a great
  fundraising team, they have a powerful
  partner, they didn't go to Harvard,
  they already have a reputation, they
  have no reputation to risk...</p>
  
  <p>This is silly, as all success is
  special. That's what makes it success.
  We don't consider breathing a success,
  since, fortunately, we all can
  breathe.</p>
  
  <p>The trick is learning about what the
  special cases have in common, in
  understanding how maybe, just maybe,
  you have some of the very same
  attributes that others have used in a
  new way.</p>
