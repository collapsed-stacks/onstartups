I would like to start an online business to sell cartoon characters Merchandise?  I found some websites already selling such.

My question is how to source the merchandise for retail sales? do I need to have a licence agreement signed with companies such as Disney | Peppa Pig etc?


I have done a lot of research but still have no clue! appreciate any help here.

Yes, you would need a license to do that, and you probably won't be able to get one.  Owners of cartoon characters and the like are very careful about licensing to protect their brand.
