We are incorporated in DE and do not have any business address in any state yet.
But we do need to get so-called DUNS number to apply for government money. I am planning to give my home address in CA, but I am not sure if the company is going to be considered as "doing business" in CA and will be required to file in CA (something I would like to avoid). We are not selling anything or employing anyone at this moment. Does anyone know if it's ok to use my address in CA and still pay taxes in DE only?

I'm not a lawyer, but IMHO your company **is** doing business in CA already - you're there, and you're doing business on behalf of the company.

Publishing it with D&B will definitely make it easier for the FTB to come after you.
