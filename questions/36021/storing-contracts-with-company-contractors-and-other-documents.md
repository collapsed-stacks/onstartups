A few days ago I registered a limited company in the UK. I use a registered office in England (which is my company agent's office), and myself live in Poland, and my Polish address is given as the director's address as well as the address from where the company trades.
My question is where/how do I store contracts and agreements? I asked my agent whether I have to send copies of any documents to the registered office, and they just said no.
I thought that a registered office is a place, where you store all important documents, and in case of any inspection they're on hand.
Do I just store documents at home? And while filling anual accounts I just state how much my company earned or lost?
I do realise that the English system is much much easier and cheaper (the very fact that it took me 15 minutes to start a company, and it would take me a few days to register as self-employed in Poland), but could it be so simple?

The registered office is just where your company's "books" are kept -- that is, the memorandum and articles of association (aka "mem and arts" -- basic procedural documents about how the shareholders decide on stuff, your agent will have set up the company with a standard set which you probably don't need to change) and a list of all of the company's shareholders, directors, and so on.  You don't need to keep a copy of all of your contracts there, they just need to be at home.

The accounts you file have to be a bit more detailed than just the amount you earned/lost.  Their purpose is so that someone considering doing business with you has reasonably up-to-date information on your company's health and so can decide whether or not to work with you, so it needs to have information about the company's assets and liabilities.  There's a pretty standard form for them, and I've generally found it most cost-effective to get an accountant to prepare them.
