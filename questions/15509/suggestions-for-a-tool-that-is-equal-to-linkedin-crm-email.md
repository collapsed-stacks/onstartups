We use Google Apps and Highrise. Now, they are both decent tools, the problem is that they do not integrate. Most particularly, keeping GMail contacts in sync with Highrise is a huge problem. Now, add LinkedIn to the equation, and everything blows up for me.

I'd just like some kind of tool that connects the three together. Some kind of social CRM SaaS that also integrates with Google Apps. Is there something like that? If not, could someone build it overnight? :D (I would do that, but I already run a software startup, and one project is enough!)

Doesn't Gist already do this for you? You might want to check out the free service at Gist.com

Idea is good. I think some kind of tool that allows the user to enter credentials for each service and then uses the individual app apis to keep them in sync should really be cool. However, I am not sure how many users will pay for such a service..

<p>I am working on a product that will do something very similar to what you are talking about, the name of it is TidyContact and the whole idea is to have a central place where you can manage your contacts. If you are interested in learning more about it <a href="http://tidycontact.com" rel="nofollow"><strong>sign-up</strong></a> to be notified when the application is out. </p>

I'm working on something that is very close to this (primarily because I need it myself, and because our customers could use something like that too).

The application is called Social Inbox (http://SocialInbox.com)

It's a Social CRM app that blends social media and lightweight CRM features.

I'm still in private beta, but use the invite code: "OnStartupsFan" and I'll move you up the queue.

<p>Soocial seems to a pretty promising app for this: <a href="http://www.soocial.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.soocial.com/</a></p>

<p>They do not support LinkedIn sync, and according to <a href="http://community.soocial.com/soocial/topics/sync_with_linkedin" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> for a reason beyond their control(read - LinkedIn doesn't allow syncing)</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/smartsheet-google-apps" rel="nofollow">Smartsheet service</a> seems to do everything you're looking for.  It says it has an <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/work-management" rel="nofollow">HR function</a> as well, which says it has an executive search function.  I just gave them a call, and while they noted that there's no LinkedIn connectivity (that is very hard to find, but I've seen it in Salesforce), they have noted that it will connect with Gmail.  He said the service is a "spreadsheet application" (sounds kind of basic), but the website seems to make it very simple to integrate and collaborate.  I'm going to do a free trial, and I'll update this post.  It's very economical, if it does all that it appears to do.</p>
