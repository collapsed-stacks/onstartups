I'm new to freelance designing for clients, I normally did things just for myself or for friends when they needed something done and I had a free minute. I've also worked at a retail store that does "desktop publishing" and offered a 24 hr turnaround guarantee.

Because of this, I've become accustomed to working really fast. I still plan ideas and do research, but I usually go with my gut feelings on design direction (usually the second or so idea I have is the strongest in my opinion) and the clients I've worked for always love the work I do for them.

But my problem is, because I work so fast and can almost pump out the designs they need, how do I should I charge?

Charging by the hour would be a huge loss for me. But I don't know what to charge for a flat rate since I don't know what the "average" time for a design should take (if there is such a thing).

When doing research, everyone always just says "It depends on the designer." But I feel I could be making a lot more money for my skills, I just don't want to lie about my time.

**The hourly rate, in freelance environment, is often used for some routine tasks that "must be done"** but require less creativity. In these activities, **you can more or less expect the time the task will take and thus the final price**.

**In design or other highly creative domains, this doesn't have much sense** as what counts is the "idea" and not necessarily the execution. It is also much more difficult to correctly estimate the number of hours it will take.

**At your place, I can say: go for semi-flat rate.** By that I mean "**price per project**". You can have a +/- flat rate per project type, but you can adjust it because of some specificities (so no real flat-rate, same for every client/project).

**In your case, you can perhaps charge more for faster delivery**. E.g. average "industry time to finish the task X" = 2 days, if you are able to do it in one day, give the client the possibility: delivery in 2 days for $Y or in 1 day for $X + 50%...

And **concerning the prices**, just do some **market research**. Even **if designers often give estimations only for specific project, just invent one such a project and ask them for price** (or ask someone to ask them as a potential client). **Do it for the maximum of your competitors and you will have some basis to estimate the average cost...**
