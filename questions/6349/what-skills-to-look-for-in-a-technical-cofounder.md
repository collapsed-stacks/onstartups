I am an aspiring entrepreneur, with experience in retail industry. I have an idea to create a web based company with web 2.0 + ecommerce features. The idea is new and I know that it would work in in my industry/market. I have money to invest during the initial phase, and would eventually depend on VCs/investors as we scale up. 

I am a first time entrepreneur and this forum has been my best resource to learn the practical aspects of entrepreneurship. Thanks a lot. From the various discussions, I realise that it will be better to partner with a technical co-founder, as I do not have a technical background. 

I do not have any suitable person in my immediate network, and will have to hunt for an ideal person. What skills should I look for in the person? I understand the importance of commitment, integrity, compatibility etc but don't know what technical competencies, education and experience to look for and how can I test them?

Please share some tips/thoughts.

I will look for someone who has had experience in different technical roles, someone that has possibly worked at small companies or other start-ups doing everything from hardware infrastructure to networking to software development. 

There are many people like this, and they are usually the type of people who work at smaller shops where you have to wear many different hats. Also, it helps if the person is a real geek who loves technology and it is open minded when it comes to new technologies and frameworks... someone that knows how to differentiate what they like (about technology) vs. what's best for a customer. 

I suggest you don't look for specific degrees or skills, someone with an overall knowledge, experience and passion for technology will be your best bet... your best candidate will be someone who spends some (or all) of his free time developing apps just for fun or just to try out new technologies.

Good luck!

I agree with the other answers on here so far. Get out there and meet hackers who work on small, cool projects (as opposed to engineers from big companies), or developers who are currently working in startups.

Seeing what projects someone shipped is far more useful than looking at their resume.

If you have time, the best way to find a cofounder is to work on a small non-critical project with them beforehand.  That way you get to see how quickly they can build something, but more importantly how they interact with you. 

How do you meet people to work on small projects with?  Attend meetups like Hackers & Founders, attend a StartupWeekend event, go work at a Jelly or a permanent coworking space.
