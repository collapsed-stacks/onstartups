IMHO, you should not apply to any 'competitions' and/or awards.

It give you very little in terms of PR/marketing - You can look at all the companies that run in the last few years in competitions out there (e.g. techcrunch) and see that only the ones that created **real** value happend to still be around the block.

I would focus-focus-focus my resources on building a great product/service and creating value to my users.
