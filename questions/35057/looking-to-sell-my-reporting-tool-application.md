I've built a fantastic reporting tool that can be sold to small to medium size companies.

ReportingMate is the only reporting software I know that doesn't use report designers and allows developers to provide live, interactive data to users.
Basically it makes the life of developers and business users much easier.

I put a lot of effort building the application and comes complete with source code (C#), detailed manual and web site. The application is ready to be sold right away. I even have the payment gateway setup.

I realized I can't sell it myself lacking the necessary experience and energy.
I'm looking to sell it to someone that can promote it and make money out of it.

What are my options here?
What should I do?

Thanks,
Steve

A value added reseller (VAR) in your area may be interested in branching out or converting into a software company.

It's common for software to include a third-party reporting tool. You may find a software company that is looking for a simple alternative that suites their users.

Another approach is to look for companies that sell software widgets or plug-ins. It may take some rebuilding of your app to make it more of an add-on than a self-contained application. You're already using the .NET stack and probably know a few of these providers (DevExpress.

You may need to build up a user base before anyone is interested since your tool is so different from the ribbon band report designers.

Here are some suggestions:

1 - **Hire a Marketing Consultant to help you come up with a marketing plan.**

A consultant with experience in marketing can help you formulate a plan to get your product out to your target market. They can also help you determine *who* your target market is. 

2 -  **Use social networking.**

Many new software products are marketed through Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, and other networks. Create a Twitter account with your product name and also create a Facebook page for your product.

3 - **Build a website.**

I assume this goes without saying, but I put it here for reference just in case it's not obvious. However, what might not be obvious is that you probably shouldn't try to do this yourself.  People do better at what they specialize in, and building a great website involves a great content writer, a great web designer, and a great front-end coder. Most of us can not do all 3 -professionally-.  Note the emphasis on the word "professionally".  

Having a good website is key to making your product look like it has social proof and is not something someone slapped together in their basement :)

4 - **Advertise on Google**

Advertising on Google using Adwords can help drive traffic to your new website.


5 - **Blog**

Content is king. The highest ranking websites tend to be those with the most relevant content, and blogging is a great way to build content for your site.  Use Wordpress or Blogger to create a blog for free. You can also have your web design consultant build a design for the blog too so it matches your product and website branding!
