I have a Mobile App Development Team. We sync our apps to Appia's Catalog. They used to pay us on ever 15th of every month. But they didn't paid us since last 3 months.

I keep asking them for payments. Usually they don't respond at all. There response is like " Your Royalties will be processed shortly" and then they never reply back to me.

We had 80,000 USD business 6 months back. Now they owe me over $7,000 USD. I stopped processing license for new apps.

So, how can i legally ask for my Royalties which agency will help me regarding this matter or is there any specific place to report this matter to? or their is some rule which can be used legally to get them to pay my royalties.

This is the company http://www.crunchbase.com/company/appia

Are they going bankrupt now or what? They are not responding to my Calls nor my emails.

I am not from US.
