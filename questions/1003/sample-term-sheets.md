My company is working with a handful of private investors and we would like to see what a typical term sheet looks like.

Does anybody know where I can find myself some sample term sheets that show equity investments and/or convertible debt? 

Thank you.

TheFunded.com posted a term sheet that was a combination of a couple people and there was quite a lot of positive buzz around it.

<p>May want to take a look at Orrick's <a href="https://tsc.orrick.com/" rel="nofollow">Term Sheet Creator</a>. They also have a lot of boilerplate forms in their <a href="http://www.orrick.com/practices/corporate/emergingCompanies/startup/forms%5Findex.asp" rel="nofollow">Start-up Forms Library</a>.</p>

<p>(I'm not associated with them in any way or can vouch for the quality. This is off a bookmark I saved a while back.)</p>
