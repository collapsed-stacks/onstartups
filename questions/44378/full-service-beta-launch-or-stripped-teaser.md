I'm developing a search engine of sorts that will [eventually] have a myriad of features. In its current state, it is very capable of performing the most important function of all: intelligent searching.

Eventually, results will be coupled with useful, related information. That is, after the user performs a search, he or she can select one of the results to learn more about it.

My question is how I should approach launching a beta version of the site. As I said, I would be fairly confident and 'okay' with allowing users to play around with the search engine because I'm confident that the search works pretty darn well. However, on the surface it [currently] doesn't do much beyond returning results. 

Should I go ahead with a launch to start generating buzz and interest, or wait until I've implemented more features that have been planned, but not yet completed?

You can start the buzz that's for sure. Make a site, blog about it, share on fb and tw and get some people on your mailing list. This will give you some time to develop some more stuff and then when you publish your beta, send out notification email and watch the feedback. Thats what we are doing right now. Bunch of people signed up and asking when beta will be live.
