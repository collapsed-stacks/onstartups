I'm building a directory of startup quotes so that when us starters need some quick wisdom or a pick me up, we can browse though awesome quotes about a chosen startup topic. I'm almost done building out a rough prototype of the site and am harvesting quotes to add to it now.

Links to any websites that have quotes related to startups are also appreciated (I already know about [startupquote][1]).

Thanks in advance for your help!

<p>From <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590597141">Founders at Work</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, it was never clear that we were on
  to something huge.  You never know
  anything.  The hardest part in a
  startup is that you wake up one
  morning, and you feel great about the
  day, and you think, “We’re kicking
  ass.”  And then you wake up the next
  morning, and you think “We’re dead.” 
  And literally nothing’s changed.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Sink</strong> on <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/bos/Starting_Your_Own_Company.html" rel="nofollow">"Starting Your Own Company"</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In your first 40 hours per week, build
  custom software or websites for other
  companies. Charge them enough money to
  pay your expenses.  In your other 40
  hours per week, work on building your
  product. </p>
  
  <p>If this sounds like a lot of hard
  work, you are absolutely right. If
  that sounds unappealing, keep your job</p>

"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life [or do you want to change the world]"

Supposed quote from Steve Jobs to John Sculley about joining him at Apple.

Note though that I am not a Jobs fan - his ethics are highly questionable and I don't think I would like working for him.  But that quote is clear about doing something.

It is similar to the line from The Shawshank Redemption:

"Get busy living, or get busy dying"
