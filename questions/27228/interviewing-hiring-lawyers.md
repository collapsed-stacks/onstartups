What are some good questions to ask when hiring a business/startup lawyer? 

Also, other than asking these questions in person, what are some sources (online or offline) where we can do more research on the lawyer's reputation, past performance...?

This is for an early stage startup.

Before you approach an attorney you need to educate yourself on the subject matter. I hired a patent attorney last fall, but before doing so, I googled "provisional patents", browsed the US Patent and Trademark Office, and read a few books at Barnes and Nobles. 
Don't pay an attorney $500 per hour for an education you could've gotten at the local library for a $1.50. 

After you've learned a bit about the subject, seek out a specialist. Stay away from general lawyers at all cost. I needed a Patent Attorney. Seek out an attorney that has experience in the area. I checked Google Patents which listed all the patent applications ever submitted. I reviewed a few software patents, noted the filing attorney, and called him up. 

Start at your local Law-school. I live near the University of Pennsylvania. I looked up an Intelluctual Property professor and shot him an email. People love to talk about what they know about. He also lead me to a good attorney in private practice. I actually ended up filing the Provisional Patent Application online by myself. WINNING!

Good luck.

I'm an attorney and I don't know of any good online resources that will help you select an attorney.

You are best off with a recommendation, even if it is a friend of a friend thing.

When you meet a lawyer, ask about his current startup clients (this shouldn't be confidential) and what work he has done for them.  If you know someone (or knows someone who knows someone) at a startup he has done work for, then you could get a recommendation that way.

Be aware though, that many people have a bad lawyer and don't know it.  It is difficult for a non-lawyer to know when a lawyer gives good advice or bad advice.
