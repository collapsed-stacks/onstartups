I've been working on a new product for a year. This new product allows me to start developing custom software to fit the needs of each customer but developing the same software isn't very interesting. I love developing new things and I have some other ideas I would like to test.

The dilemma is whether I should continue to pursue new customers and forget developing my new ideas, or service the minimum number of clients I need to tick-over, giving me time to develop said new ideas. I'd like to employ a developer, but think it's too early.

I don't know if I should continue to reach out to new customers or keep things as they are so I can spend more time on other ideas. Any advice?
