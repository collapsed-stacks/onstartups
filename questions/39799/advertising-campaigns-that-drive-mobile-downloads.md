I want to run an advertising campaign that will drive downloads of my mobile app. I'm open to AdWords, Facebook ads, Reddit self-serve ads, AdMob ads that appear on mobile devices etc. The mobile apps are educational games so I'd like to reach both parents and kids.

**What should I consider when running this type of ad campaign?**

Two considerations I'd suggest:

 1. **Figure out which audience converts better, parents or kids, and focus on them first.** The more narrowly defined your target audience, the less additional variables you have to worry about that may be affecting conversion rates in other split tests.
 2. **Make sure you're targeting separate ads by platform**; you want to keep your landing page as targeted as possible, and Android users don't want to see a "Download on iTunes" button. You also want to be able to test setting the landing page to your market page itself.

You can promote your app on the corporate blog, submit it to review websites, post press release on the PR website, advertise it within the other apps. Use SMM and SEO tools to increase traffic, send newsletters or direct e-mails, use QR codes etc. That's not a full list of the things you may do.
