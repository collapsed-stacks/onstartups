## Using a landing page to invite discussion instead of the usual reasons

Obviously landing pages are very common with regards to collecting email addresses and ive seen that this might be especially helpful for startups that are more in the direction of social apps as they want to get as many email addresses as they can for plenty of users to be in place when they are ready to beta test or launch, clearly some startups are so focused on "buzz" that they seem to prioritize this, although im not sure that they are focused on the right thing there.

But for an app that will be targetted at businesses and beginning the customer discovery process and using/having a landing page in place as part of this (not relying on this alone) as i understand the importance that real conversations will play by actually meeting with them, do you think that it is a good idea to try and collect email addresses where you make it clear to them that you invite and encourage discussion? Instead of the usual message that you see near the email submission on a startup landing page that usually says something like "Join our email list and we will let you know when were ready"

Im not ignoring the need to meet with them, but just looking at the email collection differently, obviously even a small number of email addresses could lead to more intense discussion, even phone discussions and trust to meet with some to chat in person.

I feel that if im collecting some email addressses as part of the landing page then if i make it clear that im not after their email for the sake of building a list but to stay in contact with them from that point that i will avoid what i guess many other startups do which is leaving them guessing and probably not contacting them for months.

At this stage i wont have an app built for them to try and since its so early in the process (customer discovery) i feel that email collection for discussion will be more beneficial than email collection that sometimes appears like its more for the sake of having high numbers at launch.

I think that people that give up their email must wonder at times when they hear nothing, no follow up, no discussion, left waiting and probably at times the launch never happens.

**Would it be appropriate to encourage people to join an email list but making it understood to them that the main focus would be to discuss things with them further, rather than the traditional expectation of receiving a newsletter or being notified when something is ready for them to try?**

<p><strong>I think your premise is wrong.</strong></p>

<p>You basically assume, putting together your basic assumption from your explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of a landing page is collecting email addresses with the expectation of receiving a newsletter or being notified when something is ready for them to try</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would counter that:</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of a landing page is to Sell your Product!</strong></p>

<p>There is no other purpose, there is no 'traditional expectation'.  Therefore do what is necessary to do on your landing page to sell your product.</p>

<p>There are many landing page strategies;</p>

<p>For social media, landing pages are often trying to get people to sign up and use the product with as simple a process as possible.  But that is just one type of product, which may have a very different sales model from your product.</p>

<p>Another strategy is the "long form" hard sell, which apparently works very well in many markets.</p>

<p>What works in your particular market is up to you to try.  It sounds like you think having a sales consultation will work for your product.  There is nothing to stop you from doing this.  You just need to design your landing page to sell your product and have a sign up to get a sales consultation.</p>

<p>Picked randomly, here is a perfect example from IBM for Software Quality Tools: <a href="http://www-142.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/category/SW730" rel="nofollow">Quality management</a></p>

<p>All I did to get here was search on Google for 'software testing tools', and IBM's page comes up.
I have no idea how well this works for IBM, but you can see there is no sign up for a newsletter.  On the right they ask to continue a conversation with a sales consultant, and they will popup a chat window to chat with a sales consultant.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line, make your landing page sell your product in the way you see fit.</strong></p>
