I'm curious to know about the stock structures of a lot of companies. For example Marc Pincus of Zynga has preferred stock, where each of his share's voting power is 70x greater than those that are traded publicly.

I'm also curious about companies that went public in the 80s like Oracle, Microsoft or Apple.

Is there a one-stop-shop where I can learn more about all of the cool stock structures for companies prior to their IPO?

I am not sure about the information you are looking for, but I'd have a look at EDGAR, the SEC database, that stores all IPO filing documents (and much more): http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml

Searching the database is a pain, be warned!
