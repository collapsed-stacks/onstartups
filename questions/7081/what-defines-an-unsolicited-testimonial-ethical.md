After an order is placed by a customer, I email them regarding their order, stating:

> I hope the buying process went smoothly for you. We are a newer company and are looking for ways to improve our service for our customers. Any feedback you would like to share about your experience with us would be greatly appreciated.

At some point after the transaction (minutes to weeks), I have about a 20% chance of receiving very positive feedback regarding our service, web site, or products. I want to use this feedback as testimonials.

Is this feedback I receive considered unsolicited testimony?

I don't think it really matters whether a testimonial is solicited or not, as long as:

 1. it is genuine
 2. you ask their permission before using it

Why not just solicit feedback saying you would like to use that as a testimonial as well? That way, the customer "knows" they are providing a testimonial - if they were really happy and satisfied with the service, they will give you the permission.

You have two options. Either you can add a note to the original request: "Please note: your comments could be used as a testimonial on our site." Or, when you receive positive feedback, you would have to reply to the customer and ask, "Thank you so much for your message. Can I use some of your comments on our site as a testimonial from you?" <- or your own way of asking.

I ask for permission when I get something nice via email.  I'm up to 50 odd testimonials in 3 years and have had exactly zero people say I couldn't use their words.

Technically you're only using solicited testimonials since you probably don't ask to use the negative ones.
