I am a systems architect by profession, and I have decided to give my entrepreneurial aspirations a try. I will be going to expos and meet ups and networking with people over the next few months. I'm seeking suggestions on what my business card should say since I have not really started a company yet. 

I want to know if there are some do's and don'ts when it comes to business cards. Do I put my gmail address since I don't have a domain or a company? Do terms like technology enthusiast etc sound unprofessional? Need some suggestions.

Name, title, contact information, and a *little* description. Whitespace in the card is good. Gmail is popular enough that it is socially acceptable in a business card. A catchy term like technologist might be better than technology enthusiast, but that's just an opinion.

A common mistake made by people designing their own business card is to clutter it up with stuff. You don't necessarily need photos, and you definitely don't need 6 different fonts and colors. Less is more.

Business cards are less important now than they have been in the past, since now people tend to rely on that information electronically. So don't worry *too* much about it.
