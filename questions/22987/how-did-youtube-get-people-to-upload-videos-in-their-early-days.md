I was wondering how did youtube get their first initial 1,000 videos.  What kind of marketing method did they use?  How did they get people to upload so many videos in such a short time?

When YouTube was getting started their were several competitor video store and share services.... including Google's own service.

YouTube was the first site that consumers could use effortlessly.  When word spread that it worked, 
all the early adopters flocked to YouTube.

YouTube was a classic case of better mousetrap.
