I am a professional JavaEE/MatLab programmer about to start a venture on the side with my wife.  I am looking to minimize my up-front coding and hoping to take advantage of a mature web platform.  I am leaning towards WordPress because I used it a little bit 4 years ago.

My question: can WordPress (and plugins) solve my following needs:

 - Manage customer login info and perform authentication/access
 - Have the ability to include script/code in the site to perform custom calculations.  (Needs to be server side and hidden to client)
 - Web forms for customers entering data
 - Manage a blog on the front page
 - Nice to have: Manage credit card payments

Or is there another platform that solves all of these that I am not aware of?

There is no right answer to this, except: whichever platform you can spend the least amount of time learning to work with.
