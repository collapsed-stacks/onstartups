For PR, publicity, and good will I'm helping a local Real Estate broker put on a canned food drive.  Him and a few other merchants will be banding together.  What sort of prize, gift should be given to the food donors.  Something like a Christmas ornament is too expensive, and construction paper cut out with the donors name seems too overdone.

I appreciate your help.

Provide them with a bit of notoriety by thanking them in public with an ad in the local paper (or local community free paper) listing the names of all that contributed saying thank you.
