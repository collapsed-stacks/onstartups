## Acquire client number two

I have a small consulting business - write software for other people since I have yet to find that one product to develop for myself.  I generally have just one client at a time, which does not allow my business to get to the point where I can quit my day job.  Most of my work comes from referrals as I have yet to find a way to market my skills.

Any suggestions on how to take this to the next level?

Your overall earning power and security is limited if you are a single consultant.  I started my consulting business with a partner which has made it a TON easier, I couldn't imagine having to do it all alone. Means you need more work initially but companies are more comfortable when multiple people are there to support them.

- Immediately start looking at it like a company, not just you consulting.
- Consider finding a trustworthy individual who you can work with or sub contract projects to
- Try to figure out a recurring revenue model with your prospects. $X/mo I'll allocate a certain amount of time to work on your projects from now into the future. (only works with bigger companies)
- Start prospecting people who can help you with your work. Depending on your hourly rate you can make money as a consultant, but it's hard off of single projects here and there unless you can get a lot of those and have others help you (employees/sub-contractors). Unless you are selling 40 hour a week multi month consulting gigs.

Off the top of my head:

 - Elance and oDesk are good places to start - a lot of people are looking for dev help on those sites
 - Craigslist isn't bad either
 - Going to business meetups and networking with people
 - Pay per click 
 - SEO

Automate the work you do, so you can do it much faster. I'm in the same situation as you. Software dev, have 9-5, have other clients, but not enough of them.

I was on the same situation as you are a year ago. To get new clients, I focused my time and efforts on these activities:

- Create a social media outlet (blog, facebook page and tweeter) and updated them on a regular basis.
- I joined communities that interest me, and helped build that community.
- I offered my services to non-profit organizations.
