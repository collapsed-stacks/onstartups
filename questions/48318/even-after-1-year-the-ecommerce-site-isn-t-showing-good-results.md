Last year around august, I joined an eCommerce start-up(handicraft items) as the technical head. Though, the company was online for more than 4 months prior to me.

The website look and feel was horrible and it looked more like a blog to say the least. In a month or so, we changed the website design altogether and received pretty good reviews about the same. 

From january, we started ad campaigns on google and facebook in a small scale with $50-75 budget on each of them monthly. The campaigns are on and off and we keep changing them. During the campaigns, we have around 150 daily visits. But, the conversion rate is almost nill. The orders have been few and far.

So, I am really worried about the whole venture now. What do you think the problem might be. Do we need to advertise more extensively or handicraft just don't sell online. What can be done to increase the sales.

*Small report* :- For last one month we had 2334 unique visitors and total orders were 6.

You need to take a look at how you are targeting these facebook adverts. From personal experience of running a car detailed focused e-commerce site we found that Facebook didn't really work very well for us. Conversion rates were always significantly lower than the rates we got from good Google search adverts.

Look at who on Facebook these adverts are being seen by and make sure you are focusing on the right people. I would also consider trying out Google adverts rather than Facebook, as your produces are very niche you could get some great conversions if you manage to find the right long tail keywords to trigger against.

Making your online advertising work is an iterative process, you need to constantly review your adverts, views, conversions etc and tune them.

Something that might also be handy is if you use Google Analytics to view what landing page people are hitting and what their exit page is. Finding that people bounce instantly is a very different problem to people browsing but not buying.

A high bounce rate probably means your adverts are not getting to the right people. A lower bounce rate but still no conversions means their could be design changes you need to make to your site in order to funnel people into buying ( but that is a whole different subject )

<p><strong>What measurements did you make to determine whether the site redesign was successful (or even necessary)?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, many of us are all about professional / UI / UX, but even in this age sites like craigslist exist. Why? because the value proposition clearly resonates with the intended customer segment - and change can disrupt that perspective. Don't think so?  do some searching on craigslist redesign posts and learn (here's <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/craigslist-aesthetics/" rel="nofollow">one</a> to start).</p>

<p>Back to the problem at hand - Have you talked to your members?  The ones who sell and the ones who buy?  Figured out which ones left post redesign?  Asked them why they left?  </p>

<p>Conversion issues are typically less of a technical and more of a "what do I gain from shopping here". To understand what is gained, you need to understand who your target customer is, what expectations they have (pricing + service), and what alternatives / competition exists to meet their need (in india, <a href="http://www.nethaat.com/" rel="nofollow">nethaat</a> perhaps?).</p>

<p>Armed with this info, you can determine what steps to take in the future.</p>

@Pankaj, DO you know what SEO is ? have you implemented it in your website ? <br/><br/> But first of all  Since you are a technical head, shouldn't this be the responsibility of the sales guys ? <br/> <br/>If not, since your attempts have failed repeatedly (good that you took a stock check in 4 months), did you consider employing a sales agency for this ? Any marketing strategies ? Any youtube presence ? Any commercial videos ? Any strategies in making current customers come back to your site ? Any ideas on what you could offer to the current customers if they bring in other customers (referrals) ? How about promoting some offers. Some freebies.
Just paying google/fb some money and hoping a spike in your sales in mere 4 months is unreasonable IMHO.<br/> **P.S:** The site (rdinvent) in your profile page does not open at all. And you are a technical head ?
