Aside from using twitter and facebook as a social media to market my product photos, what else are other media out there? Hope to find another one as great as this two. Hope to get some ideas.

Why not try pinterest? It is a growing trend nowadays. Study shows that it is now so popular that it becomes the 3rd best social media next to facebook and twitter. Pinterest allows you to post photos and others view it and "pin" it.

You may also want to try flickr.com. Although not exactly designed for product promotion, it has a large user base and the images can be easily tagged to help improve SEO.
