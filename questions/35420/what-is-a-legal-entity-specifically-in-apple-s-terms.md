What exactly is a legal entity?

I am trying to form a sole-proprietorship company in the state of California. Is this
considered a legal entity? How can I set up the name for this company, other than a DBA (as
when registering as an Apple developer as a company, they do not accept DBA's, only legal entities).

Forgive me if these are really obvious questions, I'm very new to this.

If your business is a sole proprietorship, then you, an individual, are the "legal entity", and the name you provide is your full name.

Please note that in answering this question, I have not researched whether Apple's applicable terms and conditions permit you to register as an individual.

I specifically called Apple and asked this a few months ago. A sole proprietorship, even with a bank account with that name, is not sufficient. They will want to see your state papers, so that means LLC or C-Corp. They specifically said state paperwork, so maybe a sole proprietorship would work, but this is a question for them. 

The US number is 1 (408) 974-4897.

You can easily join the developer program as an individual and change. This does not affect any apps you've uploaded, but you will lose access to iTunes Connect during the weeks they take to approve your change over. So don't do the change over during an important release cycle.

There's no "legal entity in Apple's terms". The definition of *legal entity* is anything or anyone recognized by the law and by the courts in a lawsuit. If you don't act on the behalf of an incorporated business, the legal entity is you.

You need to consult with the Office of Secretary of State of California about the proper procedures of registering your sole proprietorship as a legal entity. However, sole proprietorship isn't the recommended form of doing business since it doesn't provide any protection against personal liability.
