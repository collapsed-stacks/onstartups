## I signed an NDA as an individual, but now I want my company to take on this liability ... is that possible and how?

A potential client wanted to test my SaaS service which would be storing and analysing some of their confidential data.  They asked me to sign a 5 year term NDA.  I did not have my company set up at the time, and I signed it as an individual.  

Now I have a company, but I no longer want to be personally liable if for any reason someone were to breach our security and gain access to this potential client's confidential information.

Is there a way to transfer this personal liability to my company? Is it possible to agree with this potential client to annul the original NDA and sign a new NDA that is between the two companies instead?  Or am I stuck with this personal risk until the original NDA term runs out?

Though possible the other party would need to be ok with transfering the liability and truth is they are better protected with you being on the hook rather than your company.

I don't think an NDA and a security breach resulting in compromised data is the same thing.  What exactly does the NDA say?

I doubt that "transferring" the NDA to the company will put you out of the role - since you are the company and likely can be shown that you acted in a negligent manner, etc.  I don't think negligence will be protected within a corporate entity.

Are they still a "potential" customer? or have they moved on? When they become a customer setup a new contract that supersedes all existing contracts and is between them and your company.

If they are not a customer (i.e. not paying money) then terminate the agreement, erase the data. And ask them if they want to buy it. I've wasted too much time on 'potential' customers over the years who want everything (including legal docs signed) but never spend any money. It sounds like this doc is a distraction and a worry to you, and it will distract from getting real customers.

BTW: 5 years is a bad idea. 1 year should be the maximum.

Just sign another one, between your company and the counterparty, and say in it, "The parties hereby agree that the [Nondisclosure Agreement], dated ___, between [your name] and [other party's name], is hereby terminated."

Whether or not that eliminates all liability for you is another question- I don't have the full facts of the situation- but that would make you no longer a party to the NDA, but your company would be.

Whether or not the counterparty would go for this is also another question.
