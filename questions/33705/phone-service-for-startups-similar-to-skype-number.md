I was able to get a skype number for clients to call from US, but there isn't anything listed for Canada.

I would like to be able to have a separate number for people to call from Canada, but forward it to my mobile phone.

Are there reputable services which does this? 

Basically my purpose is to answer questions, help users over the phone. Skype number lets me do this while I am away from the computer by using the skype number.
