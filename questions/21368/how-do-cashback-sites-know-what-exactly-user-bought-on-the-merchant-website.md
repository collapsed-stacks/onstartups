how do cashback sites (like www.topcashback.co.uk) finds out what exactly did user order on merchant website? (and what amount should I cash back?). Do the merchants need to have special deals with cashback website and send cashback website data about unique customers? 

Basically my question is, how can cashback site track user on merchant site? I understand cashback site sends me there with an affiliate link, but how does cashback site identifies my order? 

I'm really wondering about this. Can someone explain the back end of cash back websites? 

Thanks!

The affiliate code can be used to track who sent you to the site.  The likely scenario is that the Merchant (site you by from) is offering the cashback, and the affiliate is getting paid just to send you there.

In a different scenario, one where there is trust between the merchant and the cash back site, or one where the merchant allows the checkout to be done on the cashback site or some sort of tracking code to be in place then the cashback site could be aware of the order.  

I think in most scenarios its the latter, since the auditing and sharing of information would be something most established merchants would shun.
