I would like to name my startup MyCoolName technology/technologies Inc.. What is the difference between 'technology' and 'technologies' in a name?


Thanks!

Honestly, I don't think it matters much. But I think technology is more commonly used than technologies.

Technologies is plural, indicating the company offers more than one process, invention, or method. Is your company all about one specific technology or a plurality of technologies?

Actually I don't think it matters - the XXXX part is way more significant.  I would stop chewing cycles on T vs Ts because I don't think anyone will care much (often it will be left out altogether when you're talked about), and just make sure that XXXX is appropriate, modern, memorable and captures the essence of what you are about.

Plural?... :) If it's a start-up, you probably deal with technology but don't be surprised that with time you'd need to adapt more technologies. I'd go with "technologies". It spells diversification. Even one technology can be a part of many. if you go with technology and expand later, would you be willing to go through the hustle of legally changing your name?

Technologies is the plural of technology, **within the framework** of technology. So you can talk about new automotive **technologies** being used to lower engine emissions. 

But unless your firm is a developer of new technologies for some specific industry *(you deal in multiple techologies for say the fracking industry)*, it would be more appropriate to use the singular word in your company name.

To answer your question, I have always thought that technology/technologies was similar to fish/fishes.  If my business specialized in one type of technology, I would call it xxx technology.  And if it was several types of technology, I would call it xxx technologies.

I believe that technology can be plural just like technologies.  The difference is that technology can be used to identify a group of items in a general sense, while technologies can be used to identify a group of items in a specific sense.  So, if my business is computers, I can refer to them all as computer technology.  But if I want to stress that they are all different computers (HP, Dell, etc.), I think I could refer to them as computer technologies.

So, if my business was to cater to mainstream consumers, I would probably call it xxx Technology, but if it was catered to industry professionals, I would call it xxx Technologies.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

Technologies is plural form of Technology. So, generally there is no much more difference between Technology and Technologies. But with the concern of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), it plays a vital role. In SERP (Search Engine Result Pages),’Technologies’ is used to minimize keyword density as compared to ‘Technology’.
