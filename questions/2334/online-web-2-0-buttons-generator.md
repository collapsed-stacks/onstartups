What is a good online Web 2.0 button generator that you have used? I've seen many sites has really funky button, but because I don't have any art skill I thought I can use a generator to do that. I have used [As button generator][1], but feels to clunky to me. Is there any other Web 2.0 button generator out there that you have used?

I would argue against using sources that generate image based buttons.  They're difficult to customize (ala A/B Testing) and localize for other languages.  

You should look for a markup/CSS driven button design that will allow you include whatever text you want.  That would allow you to use data driven buttons on your site (providing the button Call to Action text).

A little more work, but better long-term payout.

This is a nice collection button generators. However, the best and most powerful will be Cool Button Designer. I own a copy myself. Cool Button Designer can generate buttons for all three states on the fly, mouse over, mouse pressed and normal states. It gives you ability to control the light and reflection, add icon to your button, to gazillion of shapes, etc... Very nice software to create Web 2.0 style button. Cool Button Designer also generates you the HTML code for you to use. It saves the templates, that you can resize any time without loosing the quality of your button.

You should try it, its not a joke, and with 3-5 minutes you can build this button from scratch.

I am using it myself for my projects, and very glad to find it.

Try it, google for Cool Button Designer. Official website has a free trial, limited with watermark only.
