I'm looking for some nice desks that are sort of wrap-around, or U shaped for developers working in an open work area.  I've poked around a little bit, and most u-shaped or wrap around desks are old style wood, or corner desks.  For a startup, we have a big open area and want each person to have their own 'island' work area.

Any pointers?

I know some will be put off by this, but IKEA may be an option to cobble together some tables to do the job.  If you have a bigger budget, then ignore this, but you could at least try some furniture that isn't going to break the bank.  And if it doesn't work, you'll only be out 50-100 per table.
