I am in the process of bootstrapping a tech start up. I am the business co-founder and I have a software developer working for free (with the promise of equity) developing our first MVP (minimum viable product). He has worked in his spare time for about 2-3 months and is halfway through the initial process.
I could accelerate his rate of production if I could get his company to take on the project and pay him to do the development during his regular working hours. As his company typically charges $150/hr for development work and he estimates there is 50-100 hours remaining, this would cost me an estimated $7,500-15,000 to hire the company he currently works at to officially take on the project. I like this option, as it doesn't force me to give up any equity in the MVP development process.
What are my best options for raising $15,000?
I am not in a position to take a loan from the bank or put this amount on credit cards and my product has not been tested and "proven" yet. So, what are the pros and cons of various options and what is most advisable?

The best option is for you to stick with what you have, I know you will not like to give out part of your equity, but here is the trick
1. Make sure you don't give out more than 40% of your equity/business ownership
2. Makes sure that every agreement is written down or typed and also signed (it is necessary for the day of trouble)

You said you are in the process of bootstrapping, bootstrapping is not just managing your resources well, but positioning your weakness as strength: that is you should invest in area of your business that will generate profit.

secondly I dont know the kind of program you are developing, am a web developer but my advice is this: don't try to design everything you have in mind now, design the essential part and as it grow in terms of sale let of the design come in as update and modification.

Depending on your personality, you may go for crowdfunding

Not sure what your product is but it seems you have a few options:

1. Tech Accelerators-like Y Combinator
2. Crowdfunding- Indiegogo, crowdcube, kickstarter (physical products only), etc.
3. Friends and family (source of most startups seed $)

VCs, Angels and all that do invest in seed projects, but they take a huge amount of equity. Same with most cofounders.

Either way keep in mind expenses past MVP, especially marketing. It is hard to prove interest without people using it.
