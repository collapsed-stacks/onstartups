I'm trying to get my head around the Magento system so that I can launch my business into the online commerce world.

Can anyone recommend any guides, books, online service provider platforms where I can find [Magento webshop designers][1] so help me out?

I have looked around and there are a variety of online platformns that offer Magento designers but I feel really passionate about my Magento online shop and would ideally like to undertake the construction process myself. So can anyone recommend if it's better to teach myself, or employ a specialist?

Many thanks,
Robert Schmidt

When it comes to web development, teaching yourself vs. hiring a specialist depends on a lot of things, including your background, your timeline, your budget, etc.  I can't comment on Magento specificially, I don't know anything about it (I'm a Drupal consultant), but in general:

 - If you have a firm deadline, get a professional.  Learning a new system yourself (if you aren't already an experienced hacker who just happens to be changing CMSes or platforms) is an extremely unpredictable process.
 - If you already have a decent amount of seed funding, get a professional.  Not only will building a relationship with a good consultant now help you down the road, but you will grow to the point eventually where you need an in-house dev.  Take the opportunity to get professional service now and focus on the parts of your business you will still be handling in 12 months.
 - If you aren't willing to really research (especially best practices, accessibility, standards-compliant markup, etc.) and plan ahead, get a professional.
 - If you are a geek/developer, but new to web development, consider hiring for a professional theme and doing the rest yourself after plenty of research.
 - If you are on a shoestring budget, do it yourself, paying special attention to your CMS's best practices so that if you bring in a pro dev later they don't have to go back and start from scratch.
 - If you don't have a firm deadline, go ahead and do it yourself, you can change your mind and get a pro if it proves necessary after you get your feet wet.
