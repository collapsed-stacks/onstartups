I'm a partner in a startup company, and we're having issues trying to find organizations within the US that are capable of certain skillsets in Web Development.

We are looking for great resources/forums/areas where we can find these organizations or agencies capable of doing an enterprise-size web application.

 JavaScript/BackboneJS/Java/Python Application.  Not looking for individual developers like freelancers/oDesk etc., looking for a group/agency that is capable of handling a complex application build.

Looking for either a list of resources or some general direction on where to find these types of organizations.
