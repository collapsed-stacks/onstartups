I am starting up a new company with 3 others which is going to be a software/web company.  I have already started on writing the software in C# 4.0, as I have a VS 2010 license, but my other partners don't have Visual Studio licenses, so we want to try one of Microsoft's startup offers. My question is: which should we use, Bizspark or WebSiteSpark, and why?

<p><strong>Depends on what your business plan is; true software development startup or more of a web design bureau?</strong> Have a <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/14538/are-there-any-downsides-or-disadvantages-to-joining-bizspark/14548#14548">look at this older question first</a>.</p>

<p>BizSpark has more <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/About/SoftwareAndTools.aspx" rel="nofollow">enterprise software included in it (SQL Server Enterprise, SCOMS, Sharepoint, see here</a>. Compare that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/websitespark/support.aspx?tab=ProgramDetails" rel="nofollow">with WebSiteSpark here</a>.</p>

<p>On the flip side, BizSpark may be harder to get accepted into. That may or may not be just a rumor, but I have heard several people state they were not accepted into BizSpark, and so far I haven't heard anyone say the same about WebSiteSpark.</p>

If you have a startup then you need to apply for BizSpark. If you are a consultant, then WebSiteSpark is the program for you. The rumors you mentioned are just that, rumors. I have been accepted to BizSpark and know many other startups who have been accepted as well. 

Tip: Make sure you have a MS employee refer you to the program, as a sponsor to increase the chances of getting accepted.

Good luck.
