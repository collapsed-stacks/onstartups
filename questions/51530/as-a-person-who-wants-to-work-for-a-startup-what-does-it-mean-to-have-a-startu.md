## As a person who wants to work for a startup, what does it mean to have a "startup mindset"?

<p>I figure out this should be the best place to ask the question but feel free to move it if think it's necessary.</p>

<p>I was reading a job offer for a software developer position. Nothing really out of the ordinary in the job description: your technical skills, your people skills, prior experience in the same field.</p>

<p>And then: you need to have a <em>startup mindset</em>.</p>

<p>When you read something like this, where do you find the right definition? The company I'm talking about is already pretty famous and it's been in the business for almost 4 years.</p>

<p>So what is it? Does it mean you need to think out of the box? Does it mean that you have to be really adaptable to new situations (and probably involving a change of requirements for a certain feature)? Does it mean it's not a 9am-6pm job? Does it mean that part of your pay is in stock option? Does it mean it's an agile environment?</p>

<p>I'm asking this because, to me, a every startup is really unique when it comes on how it's born and the workplace, so giving a generic requirement of "startup mindset" is really something that puzzles me.</p>

<p>You are right telling:</p>

<p><em>to me, a every startup is really unique when it comes on how it's born and the workplace, so giving a generic requirement of "startup mindset" is really something that puzzles me.</em></p>

<p>It is already difficult to have a "correct" definition of startup company, so surely, concerning the "startup mindset" it would be even harder to find a "generic definition".</p>

<p>When you find such a requirement in the job offer, <strong>it often makes reference to</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>unstable and very dynamic environment</strong> (tasks, working hours)</li>
<li><strong>no job security</strong> and risky environment from business point of view</li>
<li>you will need an <strong>enterpreneurial spirit</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>IMHO, this kind of requirement is also used as a <strong>filter to avoid the "Deloitte &amp; other Big 4 like" candidates</strong>, people who want rules, clear hierarchy (to see how to rise) &amp; 9 to 5 job...</p>
