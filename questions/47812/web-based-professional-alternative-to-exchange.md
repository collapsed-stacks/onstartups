I am looking for a web-based professional solution to replace an Exchange server. Although I'm basically quite confident with Exchange, it's not our core competence - hence we are using a hosted one, and this gets quite fast quite expensive (independently of which hoster you use you pay around 10 EURs per user per month).

What are the alternatives?

What we do need is:

- E-Mail
- Personal and shared calenders
- Contact management

What we really care for is reliability and availablity.
And the web UI should be professional - the design, but also the functionality. It should be able to completely replace a desktop solution, ideally including an offline mode.

And of course, everything should run using a custom domain.

Any ideas or suggestions?

PS: Please don't start a discussion whether 10 EURs per month per user is too much or not - for this question please let's assume that it is.

PPS: Yes, I am aware of Office 365, but I'm interested in other solutions as well.

Have you looked at Google Apps? It looks like it is around 4 EUR per month and it is web based and does what you need to do
