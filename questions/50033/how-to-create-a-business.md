I am in charge of a game that is starting to get very popular, and would like to start a company or business. I am in charge of a team of 3 (including myself), but me and one of the team members are under 18, and the other team member is living in America. Me and the other underage live in Australia.
What is the best option for me, company or business? And how do I go about doing that?
Thanks

I would suggest using a corporation and giving your initial members equity for work effort. With a corporation you can pull all the legal stuff , tax stuff , and other general rules in to one geographical location. You can distribute earnings based on shares or whatever other forms of compensation you would like. If you get big enough you can open offices in both countries and have your early workers head those HQ's.

I would be happy to give you more advice on how to get started if you want to send me a private message.
