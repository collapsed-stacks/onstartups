I'm curious if anyone has any examples to share of local businesses that have grown using social media alone.  

Good examples:

- Real Estate Agent facebook success
 -  http://activerain.com/blogsview/1241854/a-facebook-business-fan-page-success-story
- Angie's List success stories
 - http://company.angieslist.com/Visitor/AngiesList101/SuccessStories.aspx


Some, sort of vague, examples:

- I have worked with a women who built a small fashion label just using a Facebook page and a paypal account.  
- I have also met a consultant who kept himself busy from Linked-in 'friend of friend' type contacts. 


Do you know of any similar examples?  

I know there are people out there who have grown their business using myspace or yelp or kijjii or local city review site X. I would love to have some more concrete examples I can cite for some writing I am doing.

Ideally, I would like to hear stories where people turned a profit before they even had a website.

<p>You may like to look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley%5FQualls" rel="nofollow">Ashley Qualls</a>' story: She basically build her business on MySpace, IIRC.</p>

<p>If blogging also counts as "social media", there're some more examples in the following article: <a href="http://www.incomediary.com/top-30-female-internet-entrepreneurs/" rel="nofollow">Top 30 Female Internet Entrepreneurs</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

You might want to check out Gary Vaynerchuk (http://garyvaynerchuk.com/) from Wine Library TV. He has gotten a lot of press lately because of his book. If I recall correctly, he started out just doing the TV thing and via Social Media, took off. I think Wine Library was profitable before Gary came along and then it took off after the whole Wine Library TV.
