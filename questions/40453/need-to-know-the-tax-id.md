I'm have a few Android apps and would like to begin to monetize them with [TapJoy][1]  

When filling in the Payment Information form, one of the fields that should be filled is Tax ID. I'm outside of U.S., and for international users it states: ***"Please enter in whatever ID number is used by your country's tax authority"***

I'm not sure I fully understand this statement. First of all, I do not own a business company, I have just a few apps that I did in my spare time, and want to monetize them.  

The statement ***"Please enter in whatever ID number is used by your country's tax authority"*** suggests me that there should be a unique Tax ID per my country, am I right?

And let say, if there are 2 independent developers, then both would fill in the same Tax ID, correct?

Also, if the above is correct, usually from where I can know what is that ID.
