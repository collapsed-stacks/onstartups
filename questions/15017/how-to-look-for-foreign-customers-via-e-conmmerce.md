<li><p>You should go where foreign customers usually go. In your case, <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/" rel="nofollow">alibaba.com</a> is a good choice. When I look for factories like yours, I use that website and only that website because I'm sure to find what I need.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to that, target one country, and try to contact professionals that may be interested by your product. You are in a field that has a lot of potential customers. I would start with communication/design agencies first.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Contacting factories that do the same thing as you, but in the western country may be a good strategy too. Many of them can't handle the demand and would be very happy to outsource extra work to another serious company that is not implemented in their market.</p>

I don't think that just relying on the internet to get new business from overseas is an effective strategy. Alibaba.com is a good starting point, but to develop customers you need to actually contact people personally. Visiting strategic trade shows in your target country may be an effective way to do that.

Also, concentrate on making your website customer focused so it talks less about who you are and more about what you can do for your customer. It would also be worthwhile (if you want to trade with English speaking countries) to get a native English speaker to edit your text on the site so it flows better.
