A new customer told me my product "Does an excellent job and handles our data much faster than <competitor>." The customer said I could use this as a testimonial on my website, but should I remove the name of the competitor(I would advise customer first before changing his statement). I have avoided direct mention/comparison with the competition because I generally do not respect products that attack the competion.

*-competitor-* 

Just put the above in place of the competitor's name.  If you don't feel comfortable with it on your site, then just remove it.  The message still comes across just fine.  Plus, if it just say's (Competitor name removed) it leaves the person reading the statement to use their imagination and fill it in themselves.  They may even believe that it's a different competitor that they were thinking about using instead of you, and now they think someone else may have had a bad experience with them....

Tough call, but I would say it's okay to post it, unless it's the only testimonial on your site, or if this is normal behaviour for the people you get testimonials from. I'm with you on avoiding bashing the competition, but it was your customer who said it, not you.

Negativity always fire back. Just pre-formulate the reference as positive sentence and do not mention competitor. Something like: "Does an excellent job and handles our data faster then before"
