I am in talks with various international banks in India who're ready to provide us a US based bank account provided we meet their minimum balance requirements in a local bank.

A US based account will help us reducing time it takes to process US checks and maybe save some payment gateway fee if we ask our clients to directly deposit the amount using online baking.

Just wondering, **will I be subjected to US income tax if I am getting money in my US bank account? given that I don't reside in US nor am a US citizen.**

[Some details: I don't have an US SSN. I am an Indian resident who owns a startup.]

Update:
Please note I am NOT looking for info on "How to open a US based bank account"

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL" rel="nofollow">IANAL</a>, but you should consider the relevant state and federal documents to determine whether "financial transactions" would pass the test of "doing business". A good example of a how New York determines how it defines foreign corporation "doing business" is <a href="http://law.onecle.com/new-york/business-corporation/BSC01301_1301.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>However there are some differences of opinions regarding taxation:  from <a href="http://www.delawarecorp.com/site/ChoosingYourDelawarebrBusinessEntity/SomeGeneralBusinessConcerns/tabid/122/Default.aspx#Tax_Treatment" rel="nofollow">delawarecorp.com</a> (not the state site): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Citizens of countries other than the United States are often concerned
  with the tax consequences of owning an entity such as a limited
  liability company. A Delaware LLC that (1) carries on no business in
  the U.S., (2) derives no income from any sources within the U.S. and
  (3) has not elected to be treated for tax purposes as a corporation
  does not need to file a U.S. tax return or a Delaware tax return.</p>
  
  <p>Under the current IRS "check-the-box" rules, a Delaware LLC that does
  not affirmatively elect to be treated for tax purposes as a
  corporation will be treated for federal tax purposes as a partnership.
  It will be treated as a partnership for Delaware tax purposes as well.</p>
  
  <p>Under current Treasury Regulations, a partnership that carries on no
  business in the U.S. and derives no income from any source within the
  U.S. does not need to file a tax return. Delaware law currently
  provides that a partnership need file a return only if it has income
  from sources within the State of Delaware.</p>
  
  <p>If the LLC has only one member, then for federal tax purposes the LLC
  is disregarded, and the sole member is taxed as a sole proprietor.
  Current Treasury Regulations provide that a nonresident alien who is
  not engaged in a U.S. business and who does not derive any income from
  any source within the U.S. does not have to file a tax return.
  Similarly, Delaware law currently provides that a nonresident alien
  having no income from sources within the State of Delaware does not
  have to file a Delaware return.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't quite know how one would be able to accept payments in the US from US companies and and assert that the company "derives no income from any sources in the US."</p>

<p>That said, I wouldn't trust anyone's opinion on this matter except your lawyer. </p>

This is a burning question for everyone in India relating to technology business. More so because in many mobile platform, you can not market your application without having a bank account in USA.

I have googled this aspect for my own company and the results were not very encouraging. It is difficult to open an account without visiting USA. One bank I found could open account without visit, but the minimum balance requirement was very high.

Any pointer in this regards will be highly appreciated and
