I plan to have a web startup but the implementation is costing me a lot. Is it acceptable to look for funding at this stage? If yes, how do I do it and what are the parameters which will increase the chances of this startup getting funded?

Traction, traction and traction. That is your best chances for getting funded. Show that you are creating value. At very least, get a prototype out. 

Like anything in real life, there is no silver bullet here.

Yes, it is acceptable to look for funding. Question is, can you find one?

If you are top-notch proven entrepreneurs (e.g. Marc Andreesen), then, maybe you can get funding only with idea alone. Otherwise, 3Fs (friends, families and foes) might be your best bet. I personally stir away from 3Fs. They generally invest based on personal relationship rather than truly understand your business.

Another solution is to work on your idea part-time and slowly switch it become your full time gig.

I agree with the traction comment. Having some paying customers or a decent group of beta users will go a long way toward proving your business is a sound investment. Most venture capitalists are much less adventurous than they sound. 

Fund timing is a factor. You'll have a much better chance of getting fund shortly after the VC firm has raised a new fund rather than late in their funding cycle.

Time of year matters, too. Most angels and limited partners are on vacation during the summer months or during holidays. You'll have a better chance of getting the attention of multiple VCs at once if you try to raise money during normal business periods. (For example, in the US, the month of December is a lousy time to raise money because it falls between Thanksgiving and Christmas.)

You should be able to get to traction with savings, friends & family and credit cards. Once you get traction, you will be able to easily raise money from professional investors.

Perhaps not the answer you're looking for, but are you sure you need funding?

Aren't your investors going to look for your business to be profitable as soon as possible? Why not self fund with that?

At the very beginning you will definitely need some money for design/graphics/coding, but assuming the idea is good enough (and why would you pursue anything else), in addition to self funding you can give a reasonable amount of equity in exchange for work.
