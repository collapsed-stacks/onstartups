I am a Canadian software developer who is currently harbouring an open-source project that I am currently working on with one other person, who lives in Chile.

Eventually I want to turn the open-source project into a not-for-profit organization (starting out as a partnership between the two of us), if the project goes far enough that we can actually release a product (which may not happen for quite a while, but I am considering the possibility).

I want the partnership to be based in Canada, as I am the primary stakeholder in this project; however, I am have no idea about how this would work (or whether it's even possible) if I'm the only person in Canada who is part of the partnership.

If the answer turns out to be yes, how would I go about doing it?

If the answer turns out to be no, why not, and what is the closest thing I can get to it?

The answer is yes, is possible the partnership without your partner inmigration to Canada if you are a citizen. You only need to register and establish your startup (form of business ownership and other docs required) depending on the region you are living.
