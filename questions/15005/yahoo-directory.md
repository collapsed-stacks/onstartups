Does anyone still use Yahoo! Directory? Why would anyone be willing to spend $299 just because the company that is soul-searching itself tells them to?

I have nearly 9K links in Yahoo! and none came through a paid listing. 

Does Yahoo! Directory placement still have any relevance in determining SEO benefits?

Yahoo Directory only have 2%-5% relevance in SEO benefits.

If you did Yahoo Directory Submission for traffic then it's not useful. Many directories take links from Yahoo Directories as you are automatically submitted to few more web directories and get free one way link, which helps in search engine ranking.
