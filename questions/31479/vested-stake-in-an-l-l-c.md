I am working on a web startup and I was wondering how vested stake works in the context of an L.L.C.

The founder team would like to add a founding member to the L.L.C. with the only compensation being vested stake.  However it's been difficult finding information regarding this and the appropriate legal documentation.

Hope someone here can provide more clarity on this.  Thanks!

As @Alain mentioned, LLC's are a poor model for vesting simply because LLC's have percent ownership and no stock.

It's best to use a C-Corp. I would be a little wary if someone is offering to vest shares in an LLC. The only way to do that would be for the present owner to give up a percent of the company based on some agreement between the two of you.
