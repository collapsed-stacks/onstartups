Any ideas on where to look for investors in an green aquaculture company?  The company will have signficant revenues in year 2 in a $5B market growing at 15%/year.  Are there funds for start-up food companies?

Although I can't answer your question, based on what you've posted, I would make a recommendation. 

Investors, or potential investors, won't focus on your projections in terms of numbers, because many of them are meaningless. You mentioned that you'll have *significant revenues in year 2 in a $5B market growing at 15% per year*. But that doesn't really mean anything, because until year 2, you won't really know how much of that market you'll capture.

Instead, focus on what sets you apart, how you intend to make money (in general), how you plan on getting your business to grow. While you should be aware of how big the market is, who your competitors are, and have some projections, the focus should be on what makes your company great, and why it's going to succeed. Your timeline, like that of many startups, is highly unlikely to be anywhere close to accurate, but your plan for success could be right on.

You probably know some competitors. Some of them probably received investments. You can follow the line and find investors in that way.
