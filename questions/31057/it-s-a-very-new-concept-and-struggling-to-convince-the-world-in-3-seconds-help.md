We have a very unique platform - connecting people by analyzing their wishes, worries, desires & dreams. People are not used to it, but when we speak then people get it. People spend 3 seconds on our website before they conclude - any help?

This is not a comprehensive comment -- but a general point to provide some direction -- 

Stop focusing on how you are unique -- and focus on how you are the same. Make it comfortable by downplaying how completely revolutionary it is. 

Think about all of the ways people connect on social networks with other people. Emulate as many of the design and structural elements of these presentations as you can -- so that when you highlight your unique value proposition it is only one small jump of distinction for the customer. 

I know I have said this before on here- - but I will use it again as it is a classic:

> The car was revolutionary. A completely new industry, way to get from

Customers can make one jump-- sometimes two -- give them the baby steps to make that easy, safe and comfortable. 

Here are some other ideas based on a quick review of your site: 

 - Let me engage right away -- test it out. Let me add an element of a dream and see what the algorithm created chart would look like. Can't do that technically? Then have a scroll down list of sames I could choose from. A choose an element and it shows me what a chart would look like. this would get me engaged with the subject matter right away and presumably make it more "known" and "safer"/easier. 

 - There is nothing that provides me peer evaluation that lets me know that there are other people on the site I would want to connect with. When you go to other matching sites that are not already iconic brands they have list of other members, samples that I can see -- the site is hoping that one or more will capture my interest and compel my participation. 

 - Write some more blogs. Break it down. Provide me evidence that there is something to back up the research behind your algorithm. Incorporate stories. Show me you are an expert in this field of dream analysis and personality matching. 

 - The audience of the copy seems to be written for an investor -- not the target market.

What you've described sounds like a system where the size of the network of participants is the determinant of the value proposition. So how do you build a critical mass (start a fire)? To start, you're going to need to create an incentive for the initial pool of people to participate that does not rely on the network effect, and you need to figure out some critical points in order to generate the *right* pool of people that will act as the initial flame that starts the fire. Realize that the more diverse the pool is, the larger it has to be in order to make enough meaningful connections between participants to justify their effort. If there is a way to piggy-back what you're trying to do onto other social networking frameworks (Facebook, Google+, etc), then your barrier for participation will be lower. Points to keep in mind:

1) Lower the barriers of participation. If you can tie into other online services, this is very helpful. Take Stack Exchange as a great example... I had five choices for how to create my account, including tying it to Google. Any time I can set up an account without creating another username and password, I'm more likely to do it.

2) Clearly articulate your value proposition and why it is UNIQUE and VALUABLE to the potential participant. Too many things vying for attention out there, you've got to make your service compelling, and initially it cannot solely rely on the network effect for that value, even though eventually that might be the driver.

3) Pay attention to how you recruit that initial pool of participants. Consider ways that temporarily narrow the diversity of the pool to get started (remember, it's the number of connections between the participants that keeps the value). Facebook did not open to the whole world, it started very narrow, then slowly broadened as it grew.

I think your home page needs some work to make it graphically more appealing but I suspect that making friends through having similar dreams is a strange concept to most people and that is your biggest challenge. 

I would try some A/B testing with a different home page to see if you can increase the conversions by using different statements. The first alternate home page content I would try would be based around "What do your dreams mean?" which I suspect once you have helped someone understand their dreams they would be much more receptive to find other people who have similar and related dreams a bit like Amazons what others buy concept.

I have some point to ask you,

 - How you recognize the users feeling
 - Lets assume user writes about his/her feeling on your app, but how often they will share their feeling
 - Feelings are very that change time by time, how will you judge that with you app?
