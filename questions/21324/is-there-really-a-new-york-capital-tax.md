Henry Blodget wrote [this inchoate rant](http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-capital-tax-2011-3) in which he claims that his startup had to pay $10,000 in extra tax in New York for having too much unused capital in the bank.

What's he talking about? How much is the tax?

So it looks to me like you get hit only if you have lots of capital but no other taxable activity to speak of. If you have significant turnover, then one of the other methods of calculation will produce a higher figure.

In Blodget's case, his $3 million in capital would come to $4,500 in tax, but only if his net income is less than about $50,000 (assuming no subsidiaries).
