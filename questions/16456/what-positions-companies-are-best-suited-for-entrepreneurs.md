I'm an undergraduate senior who has always dreamed of being an entrepreneur. However, I still do not have my passionate idea to run with. I'm interested in seeking employment with a company that will allow me to hone my entrepreneurial skills. What positions are best suited for entrepreneurs? Are there any companies in particular that I should be looking into?

What are you majoring in? What are your skills?

In general, the larger the company you work for, the less chance you will have to do any entrepreneurial work. Larger companies tend to be more rigid and formulized. (However, learning how large companies work can be an advantage to you in your career.)

Look for a position at a small, rapidly growing company. That should give you the best chance to advance your entrepreneurial skills.

Re positions .. i think probably product management would be the best position for an aspiring entrepreneur.  You get to work with engineers, sales, marketers, finance and also channels.

My experience is in product management and I can say that it was definitely a very helpful position to be in.

Whatever you do, stay away from the government. I've been working for the federal government for about 10 years, and can say from experience that it's the worst place someone with an entrepreneurial mindset could ever work. The government is an innovation killer. There is absolutely no incentive for government employees to work hard (or work at all for that matter). No matter how incompetent and lazy you are, you will never be fired.  

Large established companies are almost as bad as the government, but are better. In general, the smaller the company the more entrepreneur friendly. I would suggest possibly looking for a startup, or a small business. But keep in mind that although smaller companies are more entrepreneur friendly, they are also riskier. The government is big and slow, but there is very little chance of losing your job there. 

Project management is a good position for learning. That's what I'm doing in the government, and have learned a lot.

Get experience in a wide area of functionality...

sales, marketing, customer service and development.

Then also go very deep into a technology or niche that you find interesting.  

Learn from as many different kinds of people as you can.

There is so much that you can learn in any company - even if it is only how NOT to run a company.  The only thing to avoid is becoming complacent and not learning/doing each day.
