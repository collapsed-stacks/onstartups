I've spent quite a lot of time, met quite a lot of people, but still am failing at trying to find a cofounder for my startup. 

I've gone to numerous tech-meetups, met 1:1 with quite a few people, have skyped with a few as well, but I run into the same situation over and over (with biz cofounders):

 - They see the industry I'm going for as boring . (info security)
 - They are already working on their own ideas and don't care much to want to switch.
 - They do not want to potentially partner until there is a product (we're talking cofounder here; no employee).

I'm upfront, and honest with past *failed* startups I've worked in due to previous cofounder different viewpoints. 

I'm been working for 4 months by myself figuring I could do everything from prod dev to customer dev to everything else, but it seems to be too much to try to handle myself alone.
 
What am I doing wrong here? Or have I just not found the right person yet and have found all more-or-less not good cofounders? Should I just work on a product in the meantime? I've read extensively about product development happening alongside customer development.

Is it me? it's a scary question but you end up at some point in your professional career asking it, if you don't ask that question at some point then the answer is almost certainly yes. However I wouldn't worry to much about past failings if you are open, honest and can demonstrate you learnt from them they actually can be an advantage.

Finding a partner is not just about finding someone you can work with, its finding someone with a passion for what you both want, who complements and extends your skill set. There is no hard and fast rule to say a company must have 2 or 3 founders and going solo certainly gives you complete control over any given project but having someone to bounce ideas from and to share the stresses and strains certainly helps. 

Unfortunately while you and I mare share an interest in info security and it's a very profitable niche to be involved with, especially at the corporate end it maybe hard to ignite that spark in a partner. Maybe the key is to target infosec events, look for user groups, like OWASP chapter events and similar, as places to find a partner who already shares your interests.

In the mean time perhaps scale back your ideas, getting a proof of concept or minimal viable product along with validation of the product will peek the interest of a partner who has the skill set to help you take it to the next level and if all else fails it's a great opportunity to learn a new skill set to fill the gaps. Good Luck!

If you're an individual with a history of failed start-ups, I wouldn't want to invest my money, time, and career in your business decisions.  At some point, some individuals need to realize they're not the pro at everything.  Look at Bill Gates - he knew he wasn't the businessman that would make Microsoft work, so he brought others on board.  Even Google hired a seasoned CEO.

You may be better off going in with the attitude of "Hey, I have this great product I've developed.  I'm looking for somebody who knows what I do but can handle the business end of things."
