Where can you find the most comprehensive excel business case for startups?

This questions is more specific than what it looks.  I have been looking for a detail business case excel template for a startup business.  I need something that will take in consideration my costs, expenses, liability, expected revenue, and all other variables from any business.  

Even though this might seem easy, all templates in the Microsoft website or any other, are not very complete.  I thought that here, I will find many people that went through that process and might have suggestions where to look for that comprehensive workbook.

Thanks for your help.

<p>Most accounting software gives you the ability to track all of these things. Try Quickbooks or Peachtree.</p>

<p>If you really want to track this information separately in Excel, try this <a href="http://www.planningshop.com/products/elecWorksheets.asp" rel="nofollow">financial worksheet</a> created by Rhonda Abrams. It generates all the financial statements you'll need (balance sheet, income statement, etc), and creates graphs for you. But it's not free.</p>

Are you wanting to create a financial model to forecast your business model or to track revenue and expenses when  you are up and running?

Tracking actuals is easy as Zuly has commented. 

Forecasting is a bit more tricky. Templates really need to be customised to the needs of each business to be useful, as no two businesses are the same.

Personally, I always build my own financial models in Excel as it really forces me to think about all the ins and outs of the business. It means I really work on the business model and make strategic decisions that will help the business move into profitability faster.

If you don't know how to do this yourself, I would find an accountant who understands startups who can help you do the modelling.
