First, this site has a wealth of info. Thanks for putting it up (whoever did).

I have an idea in the area of online advertising. It is pretty straightforward but I have not been able to find any company built on that model. What would be a good source of information to review and follow what is happening in that area?

More generally, what do you suggest for investigating and checking potential competition on a startup idea?

Thanks in advance.
