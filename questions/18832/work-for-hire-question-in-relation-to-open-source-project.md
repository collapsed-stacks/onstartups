I'm building my own Q&A community based on open source software that is governed by the GNU General Public License. So far I have been outsourcing the development to different programmers, but it is getting to the stage where I feel it would be wise to have work-for-hire contracts in place in order to protect ownership of future changes/features on the site. The GPL, however, requires that any modifications made to the original source are made freely available for distribution along with the source code. 

I understand that Digg, for example, was originally based on open source software, so I was wondering if this step of IP protection is something that should wait until the business has scaled, at which point the code could potentially be rewritten from scratch?

No, the GPL does not require that you release every change you make to a piece of GPL code.

The GPL *does* require that anyone to whom you distribute a binary copy of the application must also have easy access to the source code, and the use, modification, and other rights guaranteed by the GPL.
