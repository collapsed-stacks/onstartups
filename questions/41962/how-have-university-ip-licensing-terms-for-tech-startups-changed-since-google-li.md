What were the details of the IP licensing agreement between Google and Stanford for PageRank? 
For example, what PERCENTAGE equity and royalty rate did Google give to Stanford?  Were there anti-dilution provisions to the stock?  

Since then, how have University IP licensing terms for tech startups changed?  What are some modern examples from Stanford or MIT?  What are the typical terms nowadays?

NOTE: I know that copies of the legal documents between Google and Stanford are available on the web but these all have the relevant numbers redacted.  Also, I know that SEC filings show Stanford owned 1.8M shares of Google at IPO, but I would like to learn what PERCENTAGE of Google's authorized shares this 1.8M was and at which financing round it was granted, and what other, more recent, university tech licenses have negotiated.

<p>The original agreement over PageRank is <a href="http://google.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=3133372-1135104-1160564&amp;type=sect&amp;TabIndex=2&amp;companyid=633170&amp;ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fsym%253dGOOG" rel="nofollow">here</a> and it was amended later (see <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504141762/dex1010.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Stanford's typical policy (as stated <a href="http://rph.stanford.edu/5-1.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) is to accept Cash Royalties, but it can also accept equity in lieu of some cash. The actual amount of equity may vary - you'll need to ask Stanford OTL about it. Further details are <a href="http://rph.stanford.edu/4-6.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Both Stanford and MIT changed their IP licensing agreement terms slightly from future tense to present tense in the wake of SCOTUS case Stanford vs. Roche: <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N28/stanfordroche.html" rel="nofollow">http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N28/stanfordroche.html</a>
[MIT changed its wording from “agree to assign” to “hereby assign” as the case was making its way to the Supreme Court.]</p>
