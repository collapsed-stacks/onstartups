<p>Sorry for the California specificity of my question, but that is where I am located.  I want to close my S-corp (I'm taking a full time job).  Ideally, I'd like to do it before the end of the year because California charges you an $800 fee if your corporation exists for even part of the year, regardless of whether you make money, lose money, or don't do a thing.  However, I'm not sure I can close it (legally) as I have to file taxes in April, 2014 for tax year 2013.  I don't even receive my w-2s for my sole employee (myself!) until January of 2014.</p>

<p>My questions then:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to close an S-corp (looking for a reference or website here)</li>
<li>Can I close it before year end or somehow avoid the 2014 800 fee?</li>
</ol>

<p>P.S.  Sorry to see that this site is closing.  I don't use it much but when I have a question it is very useful.</p>

<p>Secretary of State is your friend here. You fill a <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/corp/pdf/dissolutions/corp_stkdiss.pdf" rel="nofollow">form for dissolution of your corporation</a>. Read instructions carefully. There are several different forms in the PDF - you need to chose which ones are appropriate for your case, you don't need to fill all of them.</p>

<p>You can close it any time. Last tax return is filed 3 and 1/2 months after the end of your tax year, which would be the day when your corporation was closed. It is called "short year", and on the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120s.pdf" rel="nofollow">1120-S</a> you should check the "Final Return" checkbox to let the IRS know that the corporation is closed. For the State taxes - you similarly file the <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2012/12_100s.pdf" rel="nofollow">form 100S</a>, and check the "Dissolved" checkbox.</p>

<p>As to the $800 fee, you were exempt from it for the first year, so you're good now.</p>
