I'm starting a web startup that hosts open source scripts such as wordpress, joomla, phpbb etc for free, any user gets a working website, with a sub-domain.

Users get free sub-domain and hosting, which they can use to install open source scripts!

Features for future implementation:
- Add custom domains
- unlimited storage
- one click installs
And much more


I would like to know your opinion on this start up (I will be going online in a few days and would like to know your opinion/comments)

Thank you in advance

Your market isn't identified and how your going to make money from this endever is not known.  So not seeing how it is a business yet, looks more like a non profit on how you have described it.

Perhaps you can describe both your market and your revenue model and this can be better assessed by the community. 

good luck

You need monster amounts of traffic to make money with advertisement. It's hard even when you put ads on highly trafficked pages. Admin pages are used extremely rarely.

Hosting content is not cheap. Storage and bandwidth are still relatively expensive (check S3 prices). In order to make the economics work, you would have to have a large number of customers, showing ads on a large number of pages and at that scale you'll need many servers and lots of bandwidth and storage. It'll no longer be a one-man operation to take care of the sys admining, development and customer support.

At the same time you'll compete with companies like WordPress.com, posterous, tumbler, which are already titans in this market.

Outlook not good.

You should spend some time verifying your numbers i.e. spend time doing back-of-the-envelope calculations on how much page views you need to earn X dollars from AdSense, how much storage, bandwidth and servers will serving that many page views take, how many people will have to sign up for your service, what is your cost of acquiring customers etc.

It's clear that you can't provide such service for free based on ad revenue from admin pages, that are almost never looked at.

Most likely it won't work even if you plaster ads all over the sites you host, because you'll have customer acquisition costs and will not be competitive with other for-free established players (like the mentioned wordpress, posterous, tumbler), because they don't do ads.

Consider that this is a really old idea, successfully employed a decade ago by Geocities. The rule in such cases is that to be successful with such an idea, you need to be among the first and execute well. After that the market is extremely hard to get into.

When you face such conditions, your best hope is to offer a more specialized product. Tumbler is like blog hosting but focused on re-blogging other people's posts. Posterous is like blog hosting but they focused on making it as easy as possible to create the blog and post to it.

You have to come up with an idea that makes your product significantly different from existing products in a way that is useful for enough people to constitute a market.

Tto use economic speak: you have to come up with a way to segment a large, generic market into submarkets, for example blog hosting for toddlers (if only toddlers could type and had credit cards).

What you describe is already available for free.  Many hosting companies also provide that service already, included in the base plan.

In short, it doesn't sound valuable, and it certainly doesn't sound like something that would generate enough traffic to monetize with ads.

I agree with the comments above, I find it difficult for your web startup to succeed the way you described it in your question. However, don't let that stop you from releasing your service, but I suggest you consider changing your service so it differentiates from the service some hosting providers are already offering.

It is true that some hosting companies provide the service for free, but it is also true that most hosting companies' service is pretty bad. I will consider using your service IF you do provide a better service and are more reliable than regular hosting companies. 

Another thing to consider is having an intuitive and simple UI, I have used several hosting providers in the past and the fact that their administration panel is hard to use and confusing has made me switch hosting providers more than once.
