I am writing a document about my company's sales process. Basically I want to differentiate between the sales where people come from search engines, advertising, recommendations to the ones that we generate/initiate from prospecting.

What are the proper terms for this? push/pull came to mind, but push seems a little agressive in a formal document.

"Inbound" and "outbound" could work. Like in [inbound marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbound_marketing) vs outbound marketing.
