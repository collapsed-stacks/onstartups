<p>I can't seem to find straight answers in my Google searches (perhaps I'm not searching for the correct keywords?) and need some guidance. What are the values in a standard e-commerce system and how are they calculated? For example in a single order containing multiple products...</p>

<p><strong>Gross Sales</strong> - Is this the sum of the retail product prices before any discounts? Or is this after discounts? Is this term the same as a <em>Sub Total</em>? </p>

<p><strong>Gross Revenue</strong> - Is this the <em>Gross Sales</em> minus discounts? What is the difference between Gross Sales and Gross Revenue?</p>

<p>Where does Sales Tax and Shipping Charges play into these numbers? In some fashion, the online payment will be the price of the product + sales tax + shipping costs so there must be a standard metric that describes the total money collected?</p>

<p>Does anybody know where I can find a good resource for this information or have time to explain what these terms mean <strong>in an e-commerce context</strong> and how to calculate them?</p>
