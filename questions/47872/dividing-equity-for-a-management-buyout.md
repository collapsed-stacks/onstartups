I currently work as CTO and VP Engineering with a company that has offered to sell the company to the President.  The president and I originally started this company that was acquired several years ago. I talked to him about the deal and offered to join with him to start this new venture.  He was planning to use some of his own money and raise the rest from investors.  I offered to match his dollars in the initial round so we wouldn't need to take any outside investors.  I would continue to run all engineering and he would be CEO.  With that, I asked about the equity division. He wanted to retain control even through a follow-on round, and is only willing to offer a 30/70 split.  Since 90% of the IP was created by me and I was willing to match the investment, this didn't seem very fair.  I understand that equity isn't divided equally based on roles and responsibilities.  Any thoughts would be appreciated on a fair equity division.
