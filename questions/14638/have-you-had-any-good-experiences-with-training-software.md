There is a sea of training software out there. Many don't have open demos. I'm trying to avoid sales pitches from dozens of companies to demo their software. I'm looking for a good lead or two from someone who has had good experiences with training software.

We're looking for something that will allow us to build some basic training modules and simple tests for the trainee to take to certify they read and understood the material. 

Anyone have any recommendations?

I've been using Articulate for the last two years. It's based off of Powerpoint, so if you can make PPTs, you can use much of the Articulate software suite right off the bat. It integrates with most LMSes (Moodle, eFront) beautifully and, as someone who isn't great with graphic design, it can make really beautiful and professional presentations.

Their online community and blogs are also fantastic; they're very responsive to support requests and constantly showing off the latest training modules people have created with Articulate in addition to best practices and trainings.

We have been using Mindflash since it was in Private Beta. It was launched on 28th September. It is free upto 10 users, and there is no lock in. It is a great training software and works like a charm for us. It is available at www.mindflash.com

I'm not going to check my own answer unless I end up going with it, but I'd like to share Limos (http://www.litmos.com) with anyone browsing this question. It is very UX-focused. I will still evaluate mindflash.com and any others that people recommend.
