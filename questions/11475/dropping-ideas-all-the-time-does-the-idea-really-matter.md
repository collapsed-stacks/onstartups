## Dropping ideas all the time. Does the "idea" really matter?

For the past 4-5 months I've been brainstorming ideas for web startups. I start to implement an idea and on the way discover that it's not going to work (too hard to implement, etc.). 

I know that there are tons of books about startups and entrepreneurship that help you through this process, and probably answer the following: 

Is it really the idea that makes the difference, or is it more about actually implementing it (and gaining experience in the process)?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Update:** Thanks for your answers, I think I get the idea  (also by reading through the site).

I think a better question would be: **How do you decide which idea to pursue for a startup?**

Let's say you have a list of good ideas for a startup, and you want to maximize your chance of succeeding by choosing the best idea. All other things being equal (money, knowledge, team, etc.), how do you choose among those ideas? Is there a sort of thought algorithm for putting each idea to test and decide?

A thousand ideas worth a penny..

Right implementation on a single one may be worth millions...

EDIT
****
To answer your second question:

Go with an idea for a  product you know well.  
Don't try things you know nothing about, because you'll spend crucial time learning it.

Create a product you are comfortable building and consider yourself a mini-expert.

<p>I have quite a radical view on this:</p>

<p>An ideaâ€™s value is directly proportionate to the time you invest turning it into reality. (<a href="http://gtziralis.com/on-ideas-and-their-value/" rel="nofollow">more</a>)</p>

<p>"all other things being equal" - to me there are three major things:</p>

<p>a) team (rock stars, fully committed, with complementary skills)</p>

<p>b) market (a hot and big one)</p>

<p>c) revenues (a clear model on how to make money)</p>

<p>So, I'd pick the idea satisfying a, b &amp; c the most.</p>

I am a firm believer, there is no such thing as a bad idea. All ideas have one thing in common they are all workable! 
Ideas are not good in your head! They need to be implemented and tweaked around to be made workable or a success!

In addition to all the advices I'd recommend the following: 

 1. Take the first idea on your list
 2. Identify potential customers
 3. Go talk to them, see if they are interested and WILLING TO PAY.
 4. If they're not - cross it out, go to the next one, if they are - see if you can really build a solution for them.
 5. If you can - try to create something very simple that solves the problem, talk to your customers again, get their feedback.
 6. Based on their feedback decide if it's worth moving on. 

I strongly believe if you follow these steps your chances will increase dramatically. Identify bad ideas early on and cross them out. Test your assumptions, iterate on people's feedback. Best ideas usually come from customers who say: "I don't need that to be honest. What I **really** need it...".

The idea matters though not because it is so great, but as the motivation to do something/implement it.  That particular idea will likely (as you and others point out) change, get booted, etc. and be replaced with others)  Certainly it has to be compelling enough for you (and perhaps others) to spend time and energy developing it.  It is the start of a journey, but it is only the start.

The real story is the mindset to do something.  And keep doing something (not necessarily the same thing).

Product and price. Can you make your ideas into a product that people will buy? And what price can you charge for it? The ultimate (and possibly only) validation of an idea is whether people will pay you money for it.

My view on the matter is that there are two kind of ideas. Those that are realisable you (and friends) and those that are realisable by not you. You should try to stick to the first, and be very careful what ideas you can make reality. That is why it is necessary to research before you start working on an idea. Don't russ into things, that the angel investor, or the vc will tell you to work it and see...they want you to loose your youth working on chimaeras, because it is profitable for them. Keep that in mind and decide where you want to put you effort. Minimise your risks,that is what they do as well.
