Information about product:

I have SaaS product. This is mobile app client that works along with server side application. I plan to charge per month for this service. There is some training involved (should I charge for it?) I expect client to pay one time fee for setup as well.

I would like to know what kind of information about product should I post on website. Do I need pricing on website? How much details do I need to put? Looking at competition - there is not much on their websites. Most just say something in general and ask you to contact their sales to schedule demo.

 1. What are the benefits (how will it meet my needs) 
 2. How much does it cost
 3. What does it look like

Then give me a clear, obvious way to buy it.
