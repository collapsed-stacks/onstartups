When a VC says they want to do a "$3M on $3M" deal what does that mean?

if you don't know what it means ... then it means:
 "take the money - you are getting a good deal"  ; )

it also means .... the VC thinks your company is worth $3M right now "pre money" and is proposing to invest $3M  so your company would be worth $6M ("post money") and the VC owns 50% **.   this is the simplest explanation.


(footnote)
** it does not mean you will own the other 50% of the company!   This is where it gets very complicated - but at least I hope I answered your question.

CJ is dead-on.

I'll expand on the "you still don't own 50%" bit:

1. Often, as part of a funding round, investors will require that you setup an option pool for employees of the company (usually 15-25%).  

2. Usually some portion of your shares in the company will go on a vesting schedule.  Which means that if you leave the company before the vesting period is up, you forfeit some percentage.

<p>Even worse, you need to understand preference shares vs. common stock and how liquidation preference may affect your ownership.  I'm a former entrepreneur turned VC.
