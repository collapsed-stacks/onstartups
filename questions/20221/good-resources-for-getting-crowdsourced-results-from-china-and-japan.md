I've been using Mechanical Turk to do QA on a mobile website.  It's working well, except for the fact that I can't seem to get results from anyone in Japan or China.

Does anyone know of a way to get results from crowdsourced workers located in either location?

Thanks.

<p>I believe <a href="http://www.vworker.com/" rel="nofollow">VWorker.com</a> has a significant user-base, at least in China. I at least regularly hire Chinese workers through that site.</p>
