Lets say I have a website link: www.___.com

Is there a way to paste this URL in a resource where that resource will give me a geographic breakdown of where the visitors are from? For example, I have a website that I THINK is predominantly visited by people from New York. Can I paste this URL and find out for sure? Have a breakdown by %

"x% of visitors are from NY, X% are from PA",  etc...

Google Analytics does an excellent job with questions like this. Free, easy, and lots of insights.
