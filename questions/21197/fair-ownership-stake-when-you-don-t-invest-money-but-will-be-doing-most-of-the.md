I am likely to begin working for a company that will incorporate and begin conducting business in a couple of months.  I am not going to be investing any capital in the company, but i will be doing about 90% of the legwork and practically all of the sales work (only salesman to start).  we discussed working for primarily ownership stake (no stock issued, only 4 ppl including myself), but I am unsure what is considered fair ownership stake when i am doing almost all of the work, but will not invest any capital or cash to get started?  Please advise

<p>If you don't get a <strong>salary</strong> for the work you mention, you should be able to <strong>convert it into capital</strong>.</p>

<p>You can accept a lower salary and the difference between the normal salary and the one you accepted is converted later into capital too.</p>

<p>What is important is not confuse <strong>salary</strong> and <strong>capital</strong>. Salary is paid to employee (it can be you) and capital is brought by investors that hope to get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend" rel="nofollow">dividend</a> or more than they invested when they sell their shares.</p>
