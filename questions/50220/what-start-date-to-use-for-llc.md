We converted our existing business from a sole proprietorship to LLC. The State filing date is May 2013 but we were already in business previously. Can the start date of the business as an LLC on the EIN application be prior to the May 2013 date, such as April 1, 2013?

No. LLC didn't exist then. The starting date is the date at which the LLC was registered with the State. For operations before that, you should use EIN for the entity you used then - sole proprietorship or partnership (if it was more than one person).
