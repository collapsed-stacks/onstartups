<p>I have a content website I will begin charging a monthly subscription fee for soon. The receipt the members receive each month will have the website's name on it, my name is not in the website name at all.</p>

<p>My "business" will be online only. I program and add content to the site from where I can plug my laptop into and access the Internet.</p>

<p>My home of residence is Iowa (my parents home), but my current address is an APO box at a military base in Japan. </p>

<p>Operating this online subscription website, do I need to file a DBA with Iowa?</p>

<p>If so, could I simply change the receipt/billing description to show something like "website.com by Chad"? (of course, trying my best to make sure the member knows the billing will look like that)</p>

<p>Honestly if you're running a business I suggest getting an LLC at least.<br>
Especially dealing with payments you have a lot of liability which you may not want hanging over your head. It's dirt cheap nowdays, and work same as sole proprietorship in that your co earnings are pass through income to your personal taxes, but you get tyhe protection of a corp</p>

<p>I see no reason why you need a fictitious business name. Individuals may run businesses as sole proprietors using their real names.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a fictitious business name would need to be filed in the jurisdiction (typically the county or the state) where the individual is doing business - which makes it impossible for you to make such a filing in the US because you are not doing business anywhere in the US.</p>
