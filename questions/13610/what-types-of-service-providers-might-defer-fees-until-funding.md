Law firms that deal with early-stage companies will often defer fees for start-ups until funding is achieved.  Are there other service providers that occasionally use this model?  I'm thinking of designers, accountants, etc.  Any examples or referrals would be great.

I've not heard of such practices outside of legal fees but it seems worth asking, especially if you could show that a large law firm had already made such an arrangement with you.

Most quality law firms and accounting firms will. Beyond that, it gets pretty thin although some outsourced dev and design firms will work for equity.  Don't be afraid to ask, though - the answer will tell you a lot.

I've seen this occur with an outsourced software development team though the main company had gone through a few iterations of funding and was a joint venture from 3 established companies with a contract already signed by partners for revenue and was about to get funding in a few months from a venture capital firm.
