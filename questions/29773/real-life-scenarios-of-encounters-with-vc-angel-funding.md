I've started lately to think about what's common sense when it comes to seeking funding from VC's or Angels. So What I would like to do is spend a few hours on reading some stories by actual entrepreneurs about their funding process.


So are there any books or good sources out there that features this process, from the entrepreneurs angle?

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com" rel="nofollow">Both Sides of The Table</a> blog by Mark Suster. Mark is a VC now, but he started out as an entrepreneur, so his advice/perspective is unique. The <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/category/pitching-vcs" rel="nofollow">Pitching VCs</a> and <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/category/raising-venture-capital" rel="nofollow">Raising Venture Capital</a> categories are probably the best place to start.</p>

<p>There is also the IAmA subreddit. The way it works is that someone starts a thread by saying "I am a <strong><em>_</em>__</strong>, ask me anything". For example, I am a serial entrepreneur, ask me anything. Then people ask them questions and they will answer them. I found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/search?q=vc&amp;restrict_sr=on" rel="nofollow">3 posts from entrepreneurs who have raised funding in the past</a>.</p>

I highly recommend the book "Founders at Work" by Jessica Livingston. It's composed of interviews of dozens of tech startup founders, like the minds behind Apple, hotmail, gmail, etc and how they started. You'll be surprised at their stories.
