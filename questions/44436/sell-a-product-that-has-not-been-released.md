I am going to be on a radio show with almost a million listeners for an interview about my product. I have a free product now, but I am soon releasing my freemium business model. I want the users that go to my website because of the interview to buy my paid product, but it isn't ready to be sold yet. (It is $5 software)

Do I do an eMail signup, so they will be alerted when my product is launched? Any other advice?

Thanks!

Ideally you want your new traffic to convert to sales ASAP - so an email list might not be ideal. You could consider some form of pre-order system.
