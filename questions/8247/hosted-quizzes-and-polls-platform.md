<p>&lt; shameless plug ></p>

<p>Hi, we offer such a platform for surveys, polls and quizzes. Our platforms is primarily used for marketing research so advanced analytics are built in. You can analyze how people responded to your survey, poll or quiz by gender, age, location, language or any combination of these (based on facebook profile data). The platform is Facebook based which helps with the virality a lot. Our company is still small, so each customer is very valuable to us and exceptional service with a personal touch is guaranteed. Oh, and we are launching embeddable quizzes and polls next week.</p>

<p>You can take a look at our <a href="http://sociallyapps.com/front.php" rel="nofollow">2 minute video tour</a> or mail me at slav [at] sociallyapps.com</p>

<p>Depends on what you are looking for. If you want to run single player quizzes, than Slav's tool is great (btw - Slav, congrats on your startup!). </p>

<p><em>a bit of self-advertising starts here..</em></p>

<p>If you want to run multiplayer, a'la 'Who wants to be a millionaire' type of quizzes - then check out oQuizo.com. Quick promo video is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm4lGv46Gu4" rel="nofollow">here</a>. We can embed the game into your site or host it externally. It's pretty good if you think about running a competition for your customers. </p>

<p><em>self-promo ends here</em></p>

<p>When it comes to polls - did you check PollDaddy.com?</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Tom</p>
