I've been approached by people wanting to buy the assets (not stock) of my company (single member llc) which consist primarily of 

 - my mobile app
 - its source code
 - the server code that supports the app and users
 - the database that runs the server and has considerable value on its
   own

How can I treat this sale for tax purposes? Can I treat it as a capital gain and if I created those assets more than 1 year ago, can I treat as a long term capital gain?

(In previous years my single member llc has been treated as a disregarded entity, so I report it as part of my personal taxes)

I found this with a google search - not sure it applies

Also, look up "Goodwill" and IRS

Good luck - it is not cut and dried.  It would be easier if you sold the company, then you could value the goodwill, etc.

No, in your case you are making a sale of a product or service.

"Assets" are considered by the IRS to be large-ticket physical things like desks, computers, etc that cost over $500. When you sell those, it's normally at a loss due to depreciation.

"Capital Gains" taxes are from the sale of something of investment-grade...your service/product isn't that either.

You're going to count this as a sale and when you deduct your business expenses to figure whether you made a profit or not in your business, then add other income, you'll pay the rate of whatever tax bracket you fall into.

You're talking about the taxation of intangibles, which is a complicated subject tax-wise.  See chapters 2 and 3 of IRS Publication 544 at http://www.irs.gov/publications/p544/ch02.html  (replace the 02 with 03 for chapter 3).
