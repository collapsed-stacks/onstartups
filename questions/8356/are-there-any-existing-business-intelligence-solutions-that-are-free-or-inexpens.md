<p>Business intelligence covers a wide area, e.g. tools to help build reports, pre-packaged solutions that work with specific apps, etc.  I would start <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business%5Fintelligence%5Ftools" rel="nofollow">here</a> and check out some of the free and open source solutions.</p>

<p>Also look at this <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/5431/what-have-you-used-to-build-a-business-intelligence-dashboard" rel="nofollow">previous question</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know what features are you looking for, but I really like <a href="http://www.pentaho.com/products/dashboards/" rel="nofollow">Pentaho</a>. The only downside is sometimes you have to hack the code to get the features you want since the source is provided for you aswell. But all in all I think it is a very professional BI tool.</p>
