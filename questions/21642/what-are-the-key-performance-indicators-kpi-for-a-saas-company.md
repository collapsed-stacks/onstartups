I was asked by a potential investor for Key Performance Metrics for our company. What do you think the KPIs are for a typical SaaS company? Here are the ones that I think we should give him:

- **CAC** - Cost of Customer Acquisition
- **LTV** - Lifetime value
- **Churn Rate**
- **MMR** - Monthly Recurring Revenue
- **MCCS** - Monthly Cost of Customer Services

Am I misinterpreting what the investor wants and looking at the wrong metrics? Any guidance is appreciated. Thanks!

The main metrics to look at is:

 - User count and growth: How many users do you have, and how is this growing
 - Retention: How many users come back to your site
 - Activity: This is define by whatever you provide, but basically you want to know if users are actually doing something on your site

Assuming you sell something:

 - Conversion rate (very importante!!):
   How many users go from free to Paying
 - Incremental Sales: in SaaS you have
   recurring revenue, so by how much
   does this revenue grow over a given
   period.

Customer satisfaction:

 - How many of your customers would recommend you to others?
 - How many of your customers have recommended you?
 - How many of your customers like you?

Competitiveness:

  - How many times do you loose against your competitors in a deal (or do you win?)

Other stuff to have: 

 - Customer Acquisition Cost: How much do you have to spend (time + Money + other) to get a customer to sign-up and to convert.
 - Life Time Value (tough to calculate but critical): what's a user worth during its life time with you (expected / average)
 - Incremental Cost per new User (how much does it cost you to add a new user, careful, at the beginning it might be almost 0 but as you scale there are some incremental steps like adding a server, adding an Sys Admin, etc..)

There are others for sure. To answer your question I would say that you could present those numbers based on assumptions if you are in the Business Plan/pitch phase but they will likely to be wrong. Maybe the investor just wants to see if you have a good understanding of your business and what matters..
