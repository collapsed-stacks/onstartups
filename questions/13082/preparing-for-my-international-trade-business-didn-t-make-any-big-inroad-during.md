Sit down and figure out why you were unproductive. What did you do or didn't do that slowed you down? For example, maybe you've spent too much time asking questions online and not enough time actually working on your business?

It's easy to lose track of time when you're doing something you enjoy. If you have this problem, maybe you can try setting a time limit for yourself by setting an alarm. You can use your cell phone or whatever you have handy.

Maybe your problem is not a real problem at all. When preparing your business, you have to do a lot of brainstorming, which you can do in an organized and formalized way, but which also can occur more spontaneously or even subconsciously.

I, for example, have sat down a month ago, wanting to prepare myself to pitch my idea. I've spent two weeks seemingly unproductive. I stared at an empty page all day, unable to get anything onto the paper. This was very disappointing and I always though "well, I *really have to* start my preparation *now*". At the end of those two weeks, I was able to write down about 15 pages of well organized text within a few hours and was instantly able to present my idea. That was when I found out that I had been very productive in the past time, but didn't even notice it back then.

Maybe you case is different, and you really need to get some distance from your day job by just hanging around and relaxing before you can focus on new things. But I see you posted this question 2 months ago, so I guess things should have changed since then. If not, this might really be a big problem.
