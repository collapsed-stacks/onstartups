My side project startup company is close to starting to sell our product. We are offering it using a Software as a Service pricing model. The price is well defined and will range from $1,000 to $4,000 a month depending on the chosen feature list & pricing tier.

At this point though, we need to get sales contracts in order before we proceed. I don't want to go overboard on lawyer fees, but I also don't want an amateurish contract. I've done some research and asked around (lawpivot.com), etc. - I've heard varying estimates on how much I should expect to spend in time & resources in getting it done.

Is it a bad idea to look at similar contracts/templates on the web and then refine the contract as well as I can and THEN have a lawyer look it over? I know pretty well what I want to put into the contract from the software side (term, sla, support, ect), but don't think its a good idea to do it all without a lawyer.

Thoughts?

For any SaaS you are charging money for you really need a properly written contract. It is a good first step to look at others contracts and pull out the types of statements you need in your own as you have mentioned, but leave the wording to a qualified professional and ensure they have experience with similar contracts. I wouldn't take risks with this.
