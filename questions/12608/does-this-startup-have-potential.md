The english is clumsy and inncorrect.  The site itself looks pleasant but because the English is clearly from someone that has this as a second language sales will suffer.

"Free for now..." is a bit scary. 

Looks like there is one In & Out for a day. What if someone has a mid-day appointment? Does it track paid holiday, personal time, and paid vacations? 

I'm not sure how many workers have to punch a time clock. Of the types of jobs that do pay by the hour/have a time clock, how many of those workers have computer access to enter this time or do they go home and enter it?

Having a database with everyone's time is great, but if this is a requirement, it has to be put into a payroll system eventually. Doesn't seem like your product is going to eliminate this duplicate effort. Do you have future integration plans with common apps?

Someone mentioned school attendance. Many of those systems are capable of automatically contacting the parents when there is an absence.

I wonder if it would be useful showing practical examples where the product could be used or even mini-sites for different markets ex. school management

Great looking site - how long did it take to build?

I think it has potential, I will suggest adding an "about" page so people interested in this application can see who is behind this project. 
Also, try to record a high quality video showing how this application can be used and place it in the home page (see 37signals.com for an example). 
Great domain name.

Good luck!

The best way to know if this has potential is to talk to some potential customers about their problems and needs and whether they could use this in their situation. Then maybe get a few of them to trial it for free.

That will give you valuable feedback about what customers need and want which you can use to make your product even better - and it will give you confidence that you are spending time on something that is marketable.

It is a good idea, but with begemoth link Google and alike, think about the way to break through into this market. Also think of the exit point. If you want to be aquired by Google, make sure they can then easily integrate your system into theirs.

I'd highly recommend getting a copywriter for your text. I'm not a native english speaker as well as you and it's definitely the way to go. Sales DO suffer from bad grammar.

Now this holds an immense potential when it comes to companies if the companies are apt with the electronic process of employee management. This can bring out a revolution in the way the business process takes place. But remember to explain or train employee to set up and start using computer to access the stuff. Is this application made by you ?
