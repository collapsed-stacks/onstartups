So I do the reading, got a feel for what I should and shouldn't do and even have a business education and then find myself circling back with habitual errors.  Hey I'm ok making a unique mistake but a bit self frustrated on the habitual ones that all the renowned writings, critique.  Do you have any and better yet did you have a habitual mistake and found a way to beat it?

Some of mine are.
Operationally
   * Inconsistent effort, with sprints then breaks.  Result each sprint requires revisiting so I know where I was at.  (start-up is part time, day job is current bread winner)

In Marketing:
   * Love to start the product before knowing there is a market.  Result I'm sure you could predict. 

Communication:
   * I find that I tend to be technical, vague and not interesting enough and so just not quite hit the exciting buzz.  Result low to medium interst.

I'm a perfectionist. The biggest mistake I make over and over and over again is not accepting the fact that sometimes good enough **IS** good enough.

There are certain things that do require you to give it 110%...in which case I give 125%. But a lot of times, the difference between 80% and 100% isn't worth the extra effort and time. I need to learn to accept that.

Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to beat it. I'm much better now than I was a year ago, but the root of my problem is OCD, which is hard to beat.

My major flaw is the ability to work extremely long hours and seem to get little done. My main issue is that although I can get a lot done when I focus, I often have trouble maintaining that focus with the day-to-day work that comes and goes. What I need to continue doing is avoiding distractions during most parts of the day and dealing with them in sizable chunks (rather than one distraction every 5 minutes). This is difficult but it is the only way to keep my productivity at the level I need it to be.

My best advice on trying to beat your flaws is to do what you already have done. Write them down, but then take it a step further. Write out a plan as to what you can do for each flaw to become better. I can't guarantee it will work completely, but I have a feeling it will help. It has helped me so far but I still have a long way to go.

My biggest mistake is saying "yes" to too many things and diluting my efforts (instead of concentrating them).

Have been consciously trying to get better by saying "no" more often, but still lots of room for improvement.
