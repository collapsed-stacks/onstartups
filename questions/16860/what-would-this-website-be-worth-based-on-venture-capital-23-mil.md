A 3 year old site which makes money through ads has received 23 million in Series A,B, and C funding.  Any guess as to what it might be worth?  Four times funding? Five times?  Just curious as to whether there is a rule of thumb for valuating sites based on venture capital.

There are some ways to try to triangulate on an answer.

1. Under most circumstances, investors will not dilute the founders below 50%. When investors start owning more then 40-50% of a company, the founders tend to feel like sharecroppers and lose motivation.

  Therefore it's pretty safe to assume that the valuation on which those investments were based was somewhere in the $50MM range or higher.

2. Most investors want to own at least 20%, or even 30% of a company.

  Therefore it's pretty safe to assume that the valuation was $100MM or lower.

3. You can try to calculate the traffic based on [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/) or [Quantcast](http://www.quantcast.com/) data. If you know anything about the industry, you may be able to make a good guess as to the CPMs they're getting, how much inventory they are filling, and what the revenue looks like.

4. You can try to figure out how many programmers they have. These days a good rule of thumb is that valuations tend to be in the range of $3-$4M per full time engineer.

In all four of these areas your mileage may (massively) vary, but it's a way to try to triangulate on a ballpark valuation that the investors are using. (Of course the VALUE is strictly in the eyes of the beholder).

It is not even possible to **guess** with the information you have provided. The website could be worth nothing, it could be losing huge amounts of money, or it could be making money.

Funding levels don't translate into value. You can pump millions of dollars into a stupid idea and still have a stupid idea. Or you can put just your own time, effort, and a bit of money into an idea and turn it into a multimillion dollar web site.

The amount of venture capital raised often has little to the valuation.  If the capital was consumed in pursuit of a business model that just didn't work, the value of the company could be far lower than the capital raised.  

For example, my first startup acquired a company that had raised over $25 million in venture capital.  We paid considerably less than that.
