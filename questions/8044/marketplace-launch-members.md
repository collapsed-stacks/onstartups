we have just launched our startup 7 days ago, and after 7 days we have 70 members and 140 entries. Because we are a worldwide marketplace we have launched with an empty database of users and entries. Our questions is do you think 70 members after 7 days for a travel startup is good. You can view our concept at www.tripsourcing.com

thanks for your advice.

<p>Congrats on your launch!</p>

<p>It's hard to say whether 70 members over 7 days is good---it depends on your goals, expectations, and investment. What difference does it make that someone else thinks it's "good" or "bad"?</p>

<p>I personally would be excited, but left wanting more. I would consider the cost of getting those 70 users, and whether that method was repeatable (i.e. how do I get more?). I'd also consider what type of users these are. Are they heavily engaged, evangelical users or one-time users?</p>

<p>In terms of general advice I recommend <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470499311" rel="nofollow">"Inbound Marketing" by Dharmesh Shah</a>, which gives a lot of helpful ideas for improving traffic/exposure using SEO and social media. It's very likely that you'll need more than 70 users for your website to be sustainable.</p>

<p>I also recommend reading <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0976470705" rel="nofollow">"Four Steps to the Epiphany" by Steven Blank</a>. I say this because from your wording I get the impression that this was a cold launch. How do you know you've built a tool users want to use? How do you know the itinerary purchasing market is large enough to sustain your business? Four Steps is a book about talking to your customers and developing a business without spending too much time and money.</p>

I think it's great that you have a website going and that there's an initial influx of people.

I also think 1 week is not enough time to know whether you'd doing well or whether it's a good business model or whether it will make money or whether you'll achieve whatever number-of-user target you have in mind for e.g. the end of the year.

Startups operate one week at a time.  Last week was a good week!  How about this week?  Will you still be adding people 70/week after three months?  Hopefully it will be more than that.  How many do you need before your revenue exceeds your expenses (including basic living expenses).  Do you see yourself accelerating towards that?

These are questions you'll answer over time.  Those will be the measure of whether you're on the path to success.

Good luck and keep asking and answering questions here!  We'll help.
