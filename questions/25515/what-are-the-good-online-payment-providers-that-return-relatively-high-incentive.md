I am looking for an online event registration solution for a client, and the client is willing share the profit from ticket sale with me. I search around for 3rd party event registration apps. The money get directly deposit to my client's bank account. The client promise to share the profit but chasing after them for the cut could be a pain. I am looking for a payment provider that automatically transfer my cut to my account and leave the rest of the client. Authorize.net's developer referral program is a prefect example but it's not available in Canada. Is there such service in Canada?

Check out BrainTree Payments.  I'm not sure if they have a reseller account, but I think their API provides the ability to split transactions.  I know they are available in Canada.
