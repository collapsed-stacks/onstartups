<p>I am currently a solo founder and an International student working on OPT. I am aware that I can get a 17 month OPT extension if my company is <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/e-verify" rel="nofollow">e-verified</a>. </p>

<p>My question is, is it difficult to get the e-verification for my company (LLC)? Will it matter that I do not have any employees currently? I do have some monthly income and I have been paying the taxes. </p>
