<p>I am having two different versions of the MVP. And I ain't sure which my users will like of course. So, I am seeking for split testing it with two different experiments.</p>

<p>The problem here is <strong>time</strong> because doing it in two ways is <strong>time and resource consuming</strong> of course, but a lot of resource here isn't money, it is all about the technical work.</p>

<p>One way in it is almost completed, it is small and involved very very less code and is a simple thing that does the main job. Another way is quite different but I find it interactive and I am pretty sure that it will work.</p>

<p>Should I have to split test?
Kindly, reply me.</p>

<p>Throw away one of your MVPs and stick with the other one.</p>

<p>The point of an MVP is to build the smallest thing possible which validates your assumption that you can solve a problem (or deliver delight) to someone and that they will use it and eventually (in some way) pay for it.</p>

<p>You shouldn't be split testing at this stage, you should be building, testing with users, re-iterating, testing with users, etc.</p>
