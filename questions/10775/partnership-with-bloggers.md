What is the best way to approach bloggers to write about your product?

I was thinking in giving way 10 shareware licenses of my product to that blogger. What do you think? What's the best way to do that? To the first 10 to register or... ?

Thanks

My first approach is to get familiar with their blog, post some comments on it to create a little visibility for yourself / your company then reach out to them about your product. See what that gets you and go from there. 

Now others may have a vastly different experience, and certainly the space you're in and type of bloggers will make a difference, but going right for the payment can have the opposite effect you desire.

Best,

Giveaways are a good way to go, because they provide value to the blogger. What the blogger cares about is gaining more trafic and/or influence. By letting him run a contest with giveaways, it has the potential to attract more readers.

One way to find out very easily: has that particular blog ever run a contest? If not, then that's the wrong approach. If yes, make the offer. By the way, 10 licenses seems a bit high, it devalues your own product.

So really, it goes back to: read the blog, get a feel for the motivation of the blogger. Some want to take the high road and provide super-high quality content and would frown at the perception of being bribed. So simply give me a free copy of the software for them to evaluate and review, if they want to.
