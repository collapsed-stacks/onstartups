I think you should be able to answer the following questions very quickly during the meeting: 

 - What are your competitors?
 - Why is your business different?
 - What are your current sales? 
 - What is your background? 
 - What is your marketing plan?
 - What would you do if I gave you X dollars for your business?
 - How do you plan to grow the business?
 - Do you have patents? Can anybody copy you?
 - Why are you asking for X dollars?

Good luck!!!

What does your company offer that your competitors do not?

What are the barriers to entry in your field / what advantage do you have over new entrants to the market?

What would happen to the business if you/one of your key people left?

What will happen if you don't meet your business plan's projections?

What will the investment be used for? (NEVER say to fund day to day operations or to pay you!)
