I'm about to open a Pet Shop mainly Dog Food Services and I have a friend who can add wide branding experience. The question is, should I pay for it or co-founder with him?

Going into business with your friend should be considered very seriously. Your co-founder is basically a relationship just without all the other stuff. 

The two questions you should ask yourself are

1. Can I see myself spending the next 10 years nearly every day working very closely with this person? 

2. Can you get this experience elsewhere? Without equity involved?

If they are a good friend they might do it for free now, if you let them know you'll take care of them later when it gets off the ground.
