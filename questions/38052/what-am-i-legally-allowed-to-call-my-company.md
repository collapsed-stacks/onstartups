I'm a student, and I'm interested in making apps/websites. Thus, I registered for a Student account with App Hub {WP7 dev program.} I also made a website where people can play my HTML5/JS based  game.

In order to pay for some expenses, I made some of my WP7 games paid. I also created a website for my 'company'. It's just that - a 'company'. App Hub has me listed as a student developer. My name for the WP7 marketplace is 'XYZName' - not 'XYZName Corporation' or 'XYZName Corp' or 'XYZName LLC' or 'XYZName Ltd.' 

However, I am now wondering what I am allowed to call my 'company'. I have no desire to go get any papers or make it legally a company - that would take more time, money, and resources than the benefits the app-making provides. As you might infer, it's simply me that's part of this 'company'.

Thus: What could I call my company if I really wanted to? XYZName LLC? XYZName Corp?

If it makes a difference, I live in New Hampshire.

<p>The only thing you are legally allowed to do is sell stuff as yourself, ie, under your own name.</p>

<p>Suffixes like "Corp" and "LLC" have very specific legal meanings so you can't use them unless you create a real company under state law.</p>

<p>A relatively simple option is to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doing_business_as" rel="nofollow">DBA</a>.  This likely also requires some paperwork with state or local government.</p>

The US Small Business Administration has an extremely comprehensive page on [registering a fictitious name](http://www.sba.gov/content/register-your-fictitious-or-doing-business-dba-name) which contains a chart showing the DBA filing requirements for several states. *Some states do __not__ require filing.* New Hampshire, not only requires one to register a trade name but also charges a fee of $50.

The specific laws surrounding trade names can be found in [Chapter 349](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XXXI/349/349-mrg.htm) of the [New Hampshire statutes](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/indexes/).

To answer "What could I call my company if I really wanted to?" whatever your heart desires  that does not include word/phrases like these:

 - same as or likely to be confused with existing entities registered to do business in the state regardless of whether the were formed in NH
 - same as or likely to be confused with a reserved name
 - same as or likely to be confused with a a registered political party
 - contain "farmers' market" unless 2+ "vendors of agricultural commodities" gather to sell things to the public (I don't kid)
 - same as or like an agency or instrumentality of the United States/NH/subdivisions
 -  "junior college" "college'' "university" or related to higher learning unless your institution provides as such
 - "corporation" "incorporated" "limited"; "corp." "inc." "ltd." or "words or abbreviations of like import in another language"
 - "professional corporation," "professional association," "Prof. Corp." "Prof. Ass'n" " P.C.", or "P.A."
 - "farm" "farmers' market" "agrotourism" unless applicable
 - cooperative
 - "limited liability company", "L.L.C."
 - "limited partnership" 
 - "limited liability partnership", "L.L.P.'' or "LLP" near the end of the name

**Note:** this list was compiled from NH Statutes, so if you really can't let go of a name like "agrotourism" try registering elsewhere.  Since you're on the web (read: not _really_ in NH), you may be able to register elsewhere. I'm really not sure of the stipulations however.
