I'm planning to hire an illustrator to illustrate in cartoon style images that may include trademarked logo or popular products. The purpose would not be to sell these art for money, but rather just to be on a website to better attract potential users. Is this legal?

For example: 

For Apple customers, it would be a 'comic-book-style' iPhone 4 with Apple logo.

You should read up on [trademark law](http://www.ivanhoffman.com/trademark.html). 

The short answer is: it depends on how you're using them. 

Using someone's trademark may be a violation if it creates a likelihood of confusion, or if it dilutes their brand.

For example, if you are selling computers, and you have a funny "cartoon style" Apple logo, it would be a trademark infringement. If you are selling real estate services, and you have a cartoon showing a lady carrying an Apple computer, it would not be a trademark infringement. As a rule of thumb, trademark infringements occur when you create confusion as to the origin of goods and services--making the customer think that a service comes from Apple when it doesn't, for example.

So... when you said "to better attract potential users," that sets off alarms in my head. If you're trying to use Apple's brand equity to attract users, you might be violating their trademark.

<p>What you would like to do probably violates <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html" rel="nofollow">Apple's trademark guidelines</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may not use the Apple Logo or any
  other Apple-owned graphic symbol,
  logo, or icon on or in connection with
  web sites, products, packaging,
  manuals, promotional/advertising
  materials, or for any other purpose
  except pursuant to an express written
  trademark license from Apple, such as
  a reseller agreement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn't make it necessarily a violation of US trademark law, but I imagine you don't want Apple attorneys sending you C&amp;D letters.  Many companies prohibit the use of their logos in similar ways.</p>

It sounds like you aren't going to defraud them or confuse people by passing yourself off as Apple, more use them as they are part of popular culture. 

Its a cartoom which is "like" apple, 10% difference to any of the apple registered logos is hard for them to prove. If you have a disclaimer on the site saying "your not affiliated but these are for illistration or paradoy purposes" then you could be alright ... but better to ask a professional.

Or if you are using the apple logo to represent the "Apple" area of your site, then there are heaps of websites that do that with apple and MS logos to either resell their products or sell products that run on those platforms ... not sure if they have consulted their lawyers or not :)

So the answers seem to come down to:

 - What are you selling on the site? If its stuff with Apple logos on it then your probably in trouble.
 - Is it likely to be confused as an actual Apple product? If yes, then you have a problem.
 - Is it more like a review site? News sites and newspapers don't have any licence arrangements and publish photos/logos etc all the time in pictures, it helps sell their stuff ... 
 - Are you copying directy or using it as the basis for a new piece of art? This is borderline but there is enough examples with art and music that you should be alright.
 - Is it the focus of the site, or is it just simply a thing like a picture of someone holding an iPhone "in the flow" so to speak? If its a fan site or something, then saying "its a fan site" will probably limit the chance of C+D letters.

Practically your too small to sue, you have no money so why bother? Worst that will happen is you get a Cease and disist letter from the Lawyers and you take it down again.

... **The other approach** is to send a copy to an Apple Representative (marketing person ideally) and say this is what I'm doing do you mind? Happy to take it down if you have a problem with it. 

You will get some "no you can't use it" and some "go for it", the majoirty won't bother returning your email.
