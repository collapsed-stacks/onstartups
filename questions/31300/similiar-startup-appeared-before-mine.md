My partners and I are have been contemplating with a startup idea for a while now. We were about to start developing when one of my partners discovered a startup site that has the exact same concept. Should we stop now or be happy that the concept has been proven and push forward? We believe that we can differeniate ourselves by adding a more personal feel with our features. Thoughts?

Everybody has competitors. This should not stop you. Execution is as important as the idea itself

Go ahead!
I think only having one other competitor (for a while at least) is very comfortable.
Yo don't have to fight too much for visibility, yet for be the number one.
Search for opinions about your competitors and make your product very good where them fails.
So, when you launch, you can say your product is better than preexisting alternatives.

One of the best things are competitors who are first to market is that they have already spent the time and effort figuring out how to communicate the value of the product to potential customers.  If you decide to pursue your idea, you should consider using that to your advantage by looking at their website.  Don't copy, of course, but do get a feel for their marketing message and see if you can take advantage of what would work for you.
