Person A wants to start a C-Corp in California operating a news website.  He is wondering if the following form is legal?


- A is the only Shareholder and the only Director owning 100% equity.
- A will only be a passive investor who does not participate in the operations of the business at all.
- A invites Person B to be the Officer (same person as president and secretary specified in the ByLaw) to do all the work running the business.
- The officer, B, works only a few hours a week for this company (sufficient time since the website is small).
- B does not receive any compensation until a revenue threshold is reached (meaning likely no salary in the first year or two).

Is this legal (from both labor and structure aspects)?

Also a related question:
I read somewhere online saying "Officers, unless they are Owners of the c-corp, need to receive minimum wages". Is this true?  If it's true then what's the minimum % equity A needs to give B to qualify him as an Owner?

Thanks.

I'm not a lawyer and not a tax professional, do verify everything with a licensed attorney and a CPA in California.

Fine,

Fine (as long as its a **C** corp).

Fine.

> 4 - The officer, B, works only a few hours a week for this company

Fine.  Although people (IRS, for example) might ask how do you manage a *news* site - a few hours a week?

**Not fine**. You have to pay salaries to officers (and any other employee for that matter, check the California laws for exemptions). 

> I read somewhere online saying "Officers, unless they are Owners of

Yes. And owners who are officers must also draw salary. In fact, you have to pay **reasonable** salaries, i.e.: minimum wage might not be enough for a CEO, however small the company is.

Becoming an owner won't make B any less of an officer.

So, first of all, if A is a director, recognize that he will be involved in the business -- the board can delegate day-to-day decision making to the officers, but the board is ultimately responsible for the company's actions.

Secondly, you're mixing up some C- corp and S- corp ideas.   In an S-corp, the IRS does not want owners coming along and saying "I made $1000 from this company as a salary, and $1M as a dividend" because the $1M wouldn't be subject to payroll taxes.  So, S-corp owners have to pay themselves a reasonable salary.  The situation is reversed in C-corps: the IRS wants to make sure that you're not over-paying yourself salary to avoid double-taxation.

Thirdly, as to whether officers can defer payment, that's usually a question answered under the local state's Wage and Hour Law.  Many states exclude executives from their laws.  You'd have to check California's law.
