We just got filed as an official LLC in CT and were wondering how we get our Tax ID number(EIN). We would like to open a bank account for the company and assume we need that to open one.

<p>You can do it on-line at IRS.GOV (<a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Employer-ID-Numbers-%28EINs%29-">here's the direct link to the EIN page</a>). If you don't want to apply on-line (and get the number instantly), you can instead fill and send <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-SS-4,-Application-for-Employer-Identification-Number-%28EIN%29">the form SS-4</a> (and wait for the number for several weeks to arrive in the mail).</p>

<p>Make sure to read all the information and the instructions on the site to understand how to fill the form correctly.</p>

IANAL and IANAA, but I would suggest that you conitnue with the CT Dept of Treasury or the equivalent.  Registering yourself with the Federal Govt may not cover everything that CT requires.

When I formed my LLC in NJ, I registered with the state.  That ID was sufficient for my bank accounts and the LLC was reported under my SSN on my federal taxes, no separate federal tax id.
