Any recommendations for a simple (web) tool where team members can submit their hours worked? Ideally, we'd like the team member to be able to login, select the project they are working on and submit their hours. In the end we get a simple report with totals. 

Anyone using a tool like this? If not I'll just have to make it I guess!

Thanks

<p>There are a dizzying number of online time tracking apps out there. So you definitely don't need to build your own. Here are some reviews of various apps:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5362829/five-best-time+tracking-applications" rel="nofollow">from Lifehacker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/05/30/optimize-your-efficiency-with-4-time-tracking-apps" rel="nofollow">from WebWorkerDaily.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/productivity/6-cool-tools-to-track-your-time" rel="nofollow">from FreelanceSwtich</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mashable.com/2008/08/28/time-tracking-tools" rel="nofollow">from Mashable</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My team uses <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/" rel="nofollow">Harvest</a>, which has served our needs well. It's not a free app, however (there are plenty of free ones on the market), and it doesn't readily sync with our accounting software. But it's easy for developers to use, easy for administrators to use, generates CSV reports, and our developers preferred it over others, so we've stuck with it.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

Try www.zoho.com/projects The entire Zoho suite is an excellent business tool and I think the specific app is what you are looking for. Zoho even allows you to manage one project for free. It includes a Time Management feature

Try TimeXchange.net, a cloud-based solution that is not only simpler and less expensive than other apps, but is based on a network so adding anyone to a project is as easy as adding an email address.

I recommend TraxTime by SpudCity.com - I've been using it for nearly a decade and it's fantastic. It's very easy to use and they have a Manager version to handle several employees and view reports. They keep the software simple and that's the genius about it.

I've used paymo and omnitracker. I think they both are free. Can't recommend both of them, they both have a not very good UI.

There are many lists and blogs on this topic. Have a look at http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Accounting/Time_Tracking/Web_Based/ for an extensive list.

I'd reccomend http://www.yanomo.com. Simple and free for small companies. But since I'm a developer here, I'm biased and you should do a good comparision. 

We found that time tracking only makes sense when there is a benefit for all users and the goal is not to control but to gain and share progress insight across the board. So do ask yourself what you want to achieve and pick the right tool accordingly.
