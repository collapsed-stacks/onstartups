Let's say I have a choice between best-something.com and bestsomething.info, and my website will contain articles how to choose best "something" and reviews of various "something".

I read a lot about this, but still cannot decide.

best-something.com looks acceptable, but it can be confused with completely different website bestsomething.com, and this is bad.

bestsomething.info I think is easier to remember, and I like it more, but I read that Google have (had?) some problems with .info domains: http://www.seobook.com/google-temporarily-purges-info-domain-names - for example some people write:

"I don't think .info names are ignored by Google, just trusted less than .com, .net, .org, and ccTLDs like .de or .co.uk"

"I think the domain name extension does have effect as one of my site aupp.info is not yet indexed on google while being submitted 6 weeks back."

To keep answers on topic, please do not suggest something like "add one more word and buy .com", "choose other name and buy .com", etc. I already tried that, and couldn't find good alternatives. I also considered other non .com domain names besides .info, but they just either look bad in my case, or hard to remember, or both. So at this point I need to make a choice between best-something.com and bestsomething.info.

The scarcity of commercial sites using dashes or .info implies you should avoid both at all costs.

Below is a conversation between the founders of [RapGenius](http://rapgenius.com/), a rap lyrics site, and [Harj Taggear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harjeet_Taggar) of [Y Combinator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator_(company)), the prestigious seed fund, as quoted in [*The Launch Pad* by Randall Stross](http://www.amazon.com/The-Launch-Pad-Combinator-Exclusive/dp/1591845297/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354864328&sr=8-1&keywords=the+launch+pad). They're discussing domain names for a proposed Rock Genius (and rockgenius.com is taken):

>Moghadam revisits RockGenius.net. "Do you think .net--?"

>"Don't do .net," says Taggar.

>"What's so bad about .net, though? It's got sort of an indie feel to it, I thought, since indie rock will probably be central to Rock Genius."

>That kind of thing is exactly the thing not to overthink," says Taggar. "People understand .com."

I'd get creative and figure out a way to avoid using a dash or a .info in your domain name because the average internet user expects somename.com. thesomename.com or somenameapp.com can work as a placeholder while your site gains traction. Remember that Facebook launched as thefacebook.com.

You're putting a lot of constraints on there but I feel like people instinctively just put .com so that may be your best option.  I feel like there are very few major websites that don't have .com (though the same could be said for a hyphen).  But in my opinion a hyphen is  less of a difficulty than a .info but that is really just opinion.

In addition it may be a decent idea to buy a few of the common misspellings of the domain and have them redirect to your site.

.com is still better since people are assuming you are a .com (quite a few times i caught my self doing that).

Dash suck big time! I have a company with dash in the url and o boy that's not good. I'm watching people typing the company name in the address bar and google without dash. Luckily google is one smart tool and he gives correct result, but again. Don't use dash. That's my experience with it.

Here is what you or anyone should do in a similar case. Buy both, then redirect the non .com to the .com and use the .com for your website. In almost every case you will want the .com, unless your target market is very knowledgeable about tech.

Neither best-something.com nor bestsomething.info. All looks spammy. Nothing about .com or .info, it's "best something".

You think too much on unnecessary details and get hyped by experts. Save that time for real business.

For domain, I suggest something unique and related to the the topic. Use .com, no hyphen, no exact match. For example, if your topic is Vacuum cleanerï¼Œ use something like "VacuumCleanerTalk.com", "VacuumClearnerExpert.com" etc.

You mentioned "please do not suggest something like add one more word and buy .com". I would say it's impossible all meaningful prefix and suffix exhausted. If that is really the case, use "JoeTalkVacuumCleaner.com" is still much better than "best-vacuumcleaner.com" and "bestvacuumcleaner.info"
