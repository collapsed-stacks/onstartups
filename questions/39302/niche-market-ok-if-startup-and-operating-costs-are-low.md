i know, i know: go after large markets. the math is easier. but my business plan calls for selling an inexpensively developed but highly compelling product to a niche industry. further, the customer base is somewhat concentrated (kind of goldilocks - small enough you can get to them all w/ out a huge sales force, large enough that losing one won't sink you). 
how do I reconcile the many niche market startups that exited profitably with the received wisdom of "large markets only, always, forever?"

<p>but I don't thinks its correct.</p>

<p>Sure if you're looking to do the stero-typical Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/flavor-of-the-month-zero-revenue-startup then thats the way to go. But you're playing a lottery with a very small chance of success (although with the chance of a huge payout).</p>

<p>There are lots of advantages of going for a very targeted niche </p>

<ul>
<li>Easier to delight a bunch of people for whom your startup fits their exact need</li>
<li>Easier to target (SEO/Marketing/Adwords/Blog copy/etc etc etc) at this niche exactly</li>
<li>Less expensive to break into and reach this niche. E.g. how much do you think it would take to successfully develop and market a new phone OS? Huge market though...</li>
</ul>

<p>And most niches are <strong>WAY</strong> bigger than you would possibly think.</p>
