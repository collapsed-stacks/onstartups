<p>About one year ago, I create <a href="http://www.kekely.com" rel="nofollow">this</a> webapp. This is a web-directory that enables users (websites actually) to post some micro-posts to output stream of website. I tried to call web-masters by emailing them; But I couldn't get their attention. Where and how can I tell people about the app? Thanks in advance. </p>
