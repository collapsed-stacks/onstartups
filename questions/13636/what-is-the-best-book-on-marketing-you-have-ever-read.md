"Best" is tough so I'll give the three (four) that had the biggest impact:

- Crossing the Chasm by Moore. Taught me principles about marketing and business strategy and positioning that I cite and use to this day.

- Selling the Invisible by Beckwith. More true than ever.

- The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing & Positioning: The Battle for your mind by Trout/Ries. Basics of branding and marketing. Building a foundation.

Sorry I couldn't pick one but these three (four) really had the biggest impact.

Cheers!

The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing All Ries & Jack Trout

I too loved this book even though some of the purported laws do not seems to hold, in particular the first (The Law of Leadership: It's better to be first than it is to be better). Many observers say this hasn't really been true over the past twenty years in the tech and internet sector.

Another vote for *Made to Stick* and *22 Immutable Laws*... other books that I really enjoyed were *Groundswell* and *Empowered* (both are more focused online).  My new addition to this list is *Why Killer Products Don't Sell*.  It's a really helpful book for disruptive technology companies trying to figure out how to better sell their product (essentially by better supporting their market).
