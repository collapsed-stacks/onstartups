I have been running a website for a month or so and as I now have some revenue coming through it, I have registered a limited company.

The company name is different from my website name, as I didn't want to limit my company with what it can do as I have some other online businesses I am hoping to launch soon.

My question is, how do I go about getting my website recognised as part of my business?  So let's say my business name is GT Enterprises for example, and my website which generates the revenue for the business is called renovatemyhouse.co.uk for example, how do I create a link between the two so that GT Enterprises is recognised as owning that website?

Here what you can do :

 1. Use About Us page as an information about your company to the customer
 2. Add product/services menu in your GT Enterprise site which give details information about  your business.
 3. You can put your company logo/your brand in your sites.
I hope this is useful.

The domain registrar should allow you to update the registration details, so that the business can be set as the owner (I assume you registered it in your own name initially).

If you ever plan to have investors/IPO it will matter, as the domain will be "outside the circle", but right now, it isn't crucial.

Having said that, it is still worth doing so that your local tax authorities will consider revenue generated to be income for the company and not your personal income, yielding favourable tax treatment in most jurisdictions.

As the other answers say: update the registration details and somewhere state that the site is run by your company.

In a similar situation my (UK) accountant advised me that if my company was paying for the hosting and the registration (i.e. the expenses for the site), then the revenue could be considered to be the companies.  Or rather the income could be channeled through the company without issue.

(Obviously, please don't take this as absolute (I'm not a lawyer/accountant etc.), but this is how I've been operating; your circumstances may be different).

Hope that is of help.
