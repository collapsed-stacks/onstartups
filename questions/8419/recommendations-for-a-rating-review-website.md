I'm building a web platform to allow users rate/review a niche group of organizations and consultants.

1. I would love to blog about the development process and design decisions. Should I keep my identity and/or the project anonymous?   Due to the nature of the project, I will probably receive lots of negative attention from these organizations and consultants. 

2. What are the legal implications and best practices while dealing with review/listing removal requests? I'll incorporate the company in Canada, but will be listing organizations from everywhere.

If you'll be blogging about it, you should make your identity known. You may decide not to disclose the details of the project, but you should always be transparent regarding what you're trying to do.

Hiding one's identity or not describing your real motivation can "kill you" online pretty quickly.

Regarding the legal implications and best practices, maybe you could take a look at some similar sites like www.Yelp.com, a website where people post their reviews (good and bad) about products and services. They probably have some sort of rules&policies about how it works.

Hope this helps
Michel
