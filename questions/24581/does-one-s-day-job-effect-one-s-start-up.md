## Does one's "day job" effect one's start-up?

I have a start-up idea I'd like to move forward on.  There's no way I could quit my job outright to work on it, but as a single mom, I also couldn't pull off the hours I currently work plus the start-up.

I'm considering looking for a part-time job to supplement my income during the start-up's first six months to a year.  Obviously there aren't a lot of challenging programming jobs that fit that profile, so it'd probably either be something in an unrelated field (or even something unskilled) that leaves me enough time to get my start-up off the ground.

My concern is how that day job might reflect on my start-up.  I think I'd actually like a few hours/week doing something random like teaching a technology program at a youth center, or as a part-time editor/typesetter for one of the publishers I know, but I don't want to get to the point where my start-up is ready to take off and find that I have less credibility because I spent the last 6-12 months doing a job that is related neither to technology or entrepreneurship.

I think if you can get to the point where you managed to :
1 Have an idea and quit your job for that
2 Find a solution to boot your startup (part time job)

Then you shouldn't get less but **more** credibility having achieved something most people fail at. Depending on your business and strategy, you can even make it a story to tell and buzz about your project.

**Yes, very much**. It's one of the question I had the most from investors : "Are you going to work full time in your company".

To increase your chances to be successful, you need to invest all your (work) time in your project.

Some experienced entrepreneurs are able to work on several start-ups at the same time, but I wouldn't recommend it to you.

If there is no way to stop your daily job, do the following:

1.- **Reduce** your (private) monthly burn rate. Less restaurants, less holidays, less waste.

2.- **Save** what you earn in the previous step and even more if you can.

3.- **Launch** your startup when you saved enough to live at the same pace of point 1. It is mandatory to quit your job at this point.

If you fail at point 3, repeat the process from point 1.
