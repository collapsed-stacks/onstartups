I am going to start up a website in the near future and I am aiming to receive at least 10,000 unique page views daily (hopefully up to 100,000 daily). From what I have researched, a CTR of 10% is completely possible, and a 5% CTR is even considered somewhat low, and 15%+ is considered higher than normal. I also researched that the most common amount of money Adsense users make per click is about $.25. Is that $.25 that the website owner gets or does Google still take half the profits? Basically,  will you make 12.5 cents or 25 cents? 

So, if I had a website that generated 10,000 unique page hits daily and I had a CTR of 10%, that's 1,000 clicks daily. And assuming that I make a full $.25 per click, does this mean that I would make $250 every day? I'm also considering gathering my own ads so that I do not work with Adsense and bring in 100% of the profits, so I could make $.50 per click instead of $.25 per click.

Now, assuming that I get 100,000 unique page hits per day and I have a 10% CTR, I would have 10,000 clicks per day at $.25 per click. This means that I'd make $2,500 DAILY?!? 

Please correct me if I'm totally wrong-- I'm new to Adsense and website ad revenues. If I'm wrong, how much money would I make daily with 10,000 unique page views, 10% CTR, and $.25 per click? And the same except with 100,000 unique, daily views??

Thanks a ton!

There is no average (common amount) that adsense publishers make per click, its dependant on whether the niche is a higher paying one and the quality of traffic that comes to a site, advertisers wont blindly and endlessly advertise on a site that wastes their money with low quality traffic.

There is no way that you can predict with adsense, without even a site yet theres the hurdle of increasing the traffic first, even getting an adsense account is not guaranteed.

CTR goes up and down, as does traffic, quality of traffic, advertisers come and go too, you are expecting certainties, everything staying the same and it doesn't work like that with adsense.
