I'm still trying to figure out what influences which start-up is visible and which is not on AngelList. Partially, I think it has to do with the personal preferences of the folks at the AngelList, that possibly set some flags, and partially it has to do with who is following the start-up, if any.

I am not talking about "public link" to your profile -- that one is designed for you to share around and drive more traffic to AngelList itself. I am talking about drilling down the start-up by location or market and not being able to see your company anywhere. And that's how the users of AngelList navigate - down the hierarchical link paths.

Do you agree with my assumptions or have a different angle on this?  

If you find my premise plausible, let's run an experiment and put it to the test. If you have a start-up profile on AngelList and have no followers, let's exchange "followings"? Simply go to my "public link" ([http://angel.co/usabilitest][1]) and click "follow", and I will follow your profile in return.

Investors find startups in three ways - Via email, via site activity and via site listing.

Email: If an investor connected to your startup or an AL admin likes your startup, they can share it with a custom note to their followers. This is the #1 discovery mechanism.

Site activity: If you're following X person and they interact with Y startup, the action will appear in your activity feed and the startup will likely be recommended to you in your list of startups.

Site lists: If you browse by markets or locations, you'll see the startups. The startups are sorted by the # of followers that they have. This is what you're probably referring to. All startups are visibile as long as they (a) set themselves to be visible to you or (b) have a public profile. If a startup chose to be invisible to you and does not have a public profile, you'll never see it.

We're working on a new discovery mechanism right now - basically allowing entrepreneurs to introduce themselves to investors via any middleman that connects them.

Hope that answers it...

Ditto.. 
Our company is never showing up as well .. I logged out of the angelist , and searched from the main page .. selected the location , and industry ours never shows up in the list .. We have our profile as public . And also any update we post never shows up in the public feed , it made us feel like angellist is managing on which updates show up , or which companies are visible.

I am starting to feel during the upgrade / roll out of the new features , startups which were listed early on got lost or not being recognized properly with underlying search functions.. Bridging Online and Offline category for instance has 113 startups . I clicked the next button to cross that 113 mark - each page shows 16 startups , and to my surprise the startups being displayed are more than 113 ,Yes I went through 15-16 pages and did not find our startup ...
