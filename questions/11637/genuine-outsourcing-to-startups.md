Yes, you are 100% correct. Its quite hard to identify the fake Outsourcing. Try using the websites as Elance.com, Odesk.com, 99Desk.com, Getacoder.com.

All they provide concept of Escrow. With Escrow your funds are always safe. Once your project is done, you can release then to the hired service provider.

You can try the suggestions above for small jobs requiring 1-2 people since they would be easier to manage.  But if you require more people, or if it is a big project I would suggest you go direct to companies.  The risk with the ones above is that teamwork and coordination is compromised because everyone on your team (including you) are all separate, whereas if you outsource to a company, then your whole team can be in one location, reporting to you.

If you're looking, drop us a line at http://www.infinit-o.com, and we might be able to help you.  There are companies out there such as ours who do outsourcing for SME's/start-ups.
