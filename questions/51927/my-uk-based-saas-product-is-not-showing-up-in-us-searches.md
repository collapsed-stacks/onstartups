<p>I reckon I should get at least 5x searches form the US as from the UK, just by population metrics.</p>

<p>I get a tiny amount of US searches. (Which ironically convert much better.)</p>

<p>Is Google excluding me from US searches, even though my product is international?</p>

<p>If you use a british domain IE .co.uk they may rank your results differently based on the geographic location of the client, hence the reason some big companies have so many domains.</p>

<p>Also, have you checked whether the product is indexed? if you do a site:domain, site:answers.onstartups.com for example, it will show you what content is indexed by google. </p>

<p>If it is and your are still having issues you could attempt to use a geo-block proxy bypass tool, which were made by pirates to defeat location blocking methods that some tv networks use, that will allow you to search google as if you were "an American" to manually check how you rank. If you don't rank well it might be worth setting up a US based domain and mirroring your site. Changing your values to USD on the US domain would also be a good idea if your site allows for that?   </p>

<p>(I do not condone piracy but I do promote tools that are used by pirates when they have a legitimate use)</p>
