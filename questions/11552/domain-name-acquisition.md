How do you go about getting a domain name that is parked with someone else? (assuming the owner is willing to sell)

<p>and welcome to this site! :-)</p>

<p>Here is an article on <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/02/27/how-to-buy-domain-names-like-a-pro-10-tips-from-the-founder-of-phonetagcom/">domain name acquisition</a> that I found really, really useful. It should answer all your questions. Be sure to read the comments as well.</p>

<p>The one weak area of the article is IMHO the contract. If you buy from a large domain seller they may have a purchase process in place, with a standard contract or method of entering into contract. If not, you may want to make a small contract between you and seller, perhaps just in the form of emails, or if it's a more expensive domain a full contract reviewed by your lawyer, and signed by both parties.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be stealthy, don't let the other side see how big your need is, or how deep your pockets are. Consider masking your identity.</li>
<li>Negotiate for a good price. Don't make an intial offer yourself, don't accept their initial price.</li>
<li>Use an escrow service. This is a valuable protection for both buyer and seller.</li>
<li>After you have agreed to deal, move fast. Don't delay, and risk someone else buying the domain.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.whois.com/" rel="nofollow">whois.com</a> is the best starting point.  They provide all of the data on the current user, including an email contact.  You can then contact them directly.  They may refer you to an auction site where they have it listed.  Good luck.</p>

Find the owner email (sometimes difficult or impossible) via web site or WHOIS record. Some parking services have "buy now" link or similar.

 
Write email asking for (or proposing) price or use the "buy" service offered.

Negotiate price and other terms if applicable.


Transfer


Enjoy
