I would like to have a directory of companies that have exclusive deals/offers to my site's members (based on vouchers and coupons). So, basically I would have to contact companies and ask them if they are interested in creating a special voucher or coupon and offer it to my site's members.

My questions:

- Are there any companies what I could contract to take care of the negotiation with the companies offering the vouchers/coupons?

- What is the best approach to get those offers from the companies? I think that just calling them and asking for a special promotion won't work. But at the same time, I don't see a reason for a big company to not offer $10 or 10% discount to the members of my site, having in mind that, if they use the voucher/coupon, it means they get a new client/sale.

- Are there any specifics that I should know of in this kind of partnerships? Any suggestions?

I would like to start with at least 10 offers.

Thank you.

<p>I'm no expert in this field, but a couple of things spring to mind.</p>

<p>First off, for specially negotiated deals you will probably need to demonstrate the benefit you can offer the company you're asking for a deal. I would imagine the larger your customer base, the more willing companies will be to talk to you!</p>

<p>The other way to go would be to look at companies which offer affiliate deals. If a company is willing to pay an affiliate for selling their services, you could act as that affiliate and offer to give some (or all) of the revenue back to your clients.  So - one of your clients signs up for a product like a new mobile phone. The phone company gives you a kick-back for giving them the lead, you then share this with your client.</p>

<p>An example of this second one in action is <a href="http://www.quidco.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.quidco.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The crucial piece of the puzzle I'm missing is how to go about setting these things up - but I'm sure someone will be along shortly with a better answer!</p>

I have been running a coupon website for years. maybe My 2 cents can help a little.

*Are there any companies what I could contract to take care of the negotiation with the companies offering the vouchers/coupons?
**A : Yes there are a lot of companies. example GODADDY. they will give/auto generate to some affiliate a unique coupon name for them to advertise godaddy's product. Most of the company which using discount code system can be contacted basically** 

    *What is the best approach to get those offers from the companies? I think that just calling them and asking for a special promotion won't work. But at the same time, I don't see a reason for a big company to not offer $10 or 10% discount to the members of my site, having in mind that, if they use the voucher/coupon, it means they get a new client/sale.
A: I agree with Chris. you have to show to the company you have a lot of users. A lot of company now offer special deal for their affiliate member. A big company will actually do a special discount/code/deal for you if they think you can bring benefits/sale for them 

*Are there any specifics that I should know of in this kind of partnerships? Any suggestions?
**Maybe learning a bit of affiliate**

Here is my suggestion to give your member something good but low cost.
From your user database, try to figure out which country are most users from.
if most of them are from NY, USA. try to purchase a good deal from groupon NY. The deal can be around USD 1 - 5 USD as the reward for the user.
you can "randomly" choose the most active user as the winner or something.

tell us how is your web work and maybe other members can suggest you with other better idea?!

good luck
