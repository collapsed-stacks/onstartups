I am officially a "legal alien allowed to work" in the USA (I have a F-1 student visa). I know I cannot work anywhere else, but the university I attend (and no more than 20h a week).

I would like to open my own company in the USA and sell software. Am I allowed to do so? Can I change the type of my visa? What is the procedure? Where can I find information on opening a company by a foreigner?

Every answer will be appreciated.

You are not a "legal alien." Be careful which words you use. You should check out http://usvisanews.com, they are one of the most pro-active and friendly lawyers I ever worked with (and I'm sorry to say that I work with quite a few).

That being said, you can incorporate in the US freely as long as you do not work for that company. Problems arise when you have an active role in a company. So while you can technically open a company today, you wouldn't be able to sell anything.

In theory, you could fly out of the US, work on your web site and put your stuff for sale, then fly back in the US and just collect the money :-)
