<p>I have a single member LLC in New Jersey.  Upon my death, will my wife be taxed (and how much) if I assign my ownership interest to her as per an operating agreement? </p>

<p>First - how would you assign ownership to her upon your death? I assume you'd be dead, being that upon your death, and unable to assign anything to anyone.</p>

<p>Second - It doesn't matter whether you assign ownership to your wife in the operating agreement (assuming you're talking about a succession clause to member's interest, talk to a lawyer), or will. In any case, tax treatment would be the same (consult with your lawyer and tax adviser, EA/CPA licensed in your state, to verify - I'm neither).</p>

<p>The fair market value (FMV) of your interest is added to your estate, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Estate-Tax" rel="nofollow">which is then taxed as a whole</a>. The executor of the estate will then assign the ownership to your wife (if it is in the will - then through probate). </p>

<p>As rightly pointed out in the comments, <em>spouse</em>'s (as recognized by the IRS) portion is exempt from the estate tax even if the estate as a whole is above the limits of the general exemption. Spouse may also re-use some of the unused exemption from your estate (this is new).</p>

<p>The estate tax is currently up to 40%, and with the exclusion amount being $5250000 for 2013 (adjusted yearly for inflation) I'm sure you can afford a professional advice if this is a concern for you.</p>

<p>Make sure to talk to an estate attorney and a tax adviser with experience in estate planning on what are the tax consequences of being dead.</p>

<p>There is a way you can transfer ownership to a trust to avoid "inheritance" or estate tax. You should consult a good CPA for professional tax advice. A good CPA is worth his weight in gold.</p>
