I am a UK resident w/ UK ltd company which is looking to market digital products e.g ebooks, video courses, software and newsletters for example.

Most vendors and customers would be based in the US.

I would like to take the payment via paypal and then pass on the money owed to the owner after taking my commision.

I have a few questions im unsure about when it comes to VAT....

***sorry, i worked out the answer to my question. feel free to delete***

If most of your customers are in the USA setup your company in the USA and avoid VAT all together!  Incorporate here, host here, setup your bank account here and your company is all set.  Use the company account to pay your vendors and publishers. 

At the end of each month, the money left over is yours.   Your USA company will simply pay you a disbursement of what it has earned.  If you setup properly you have ZERO USA tax liability!  that income passes to you as a UK resident as investment income.  You dont have to charge vat on your sales.
