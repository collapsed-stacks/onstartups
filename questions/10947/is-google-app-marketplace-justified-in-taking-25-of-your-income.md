What is your experience with selling your product on Google App marketplace? Supposedly there are a million businesses using Google App. But is Google justified in taking 25% of your sales? I mean are the leads that good? Are conversions good?

If in the end you're profitable, hooray.  If not, don't use them.

Amazon takes 55%.  Is that "justified?"

It depends on the scope of your needs for advertising.
If you sell your goods or services locally, then try to find some cheaper app brokers and/or ways to sell your app.
But, if you want to sell internationally, Google is your best bet. Its outreach is truly global and worth the 25% provision rate.

I'm hoping to hear someone who has had experience developing for Google Apps Marketplace too.

The question of worthiness is ultimately dependent on your cost of development and marketing.

Here is what I wrote to one of the questions earlier. In short, NO.


If you don't have an extremely good app or if you are not one of the big entities, I would say big NO. I have couple apps in the market (both in Appstore and App Market) and I can tell you from my experience, it's not worth time and effort you would put in. I can put in an app in Apple's Appstore and without doing much marketing, I can have 3-5 paid downloads a day. If I make it FREE, I will couple hundreds a day download easily. Now on Android's App Market, forget about the paid app, I don't even a single download even on the free one. Of course, if you do some marketing you get some free downloads. I own both iOS and Android devices. As an IT person, I love the Android phone. It's truly a smart phone and most Android users use it as such but iPhone/iTouch/iPad are mostly entertaining devices. That doesn't mean one is superior than the other. They are better and different in their own ways. Android users and iPhone users are different. They download different types of product on their devices.

Now on the pain of developing for Android. Developing the code is easy but testing and making the graphics show up nicely aligned for all Android devices is next to impossible and good luck with that. It's not fun. I am not a graphics designer and it's an extra challenge for me.
