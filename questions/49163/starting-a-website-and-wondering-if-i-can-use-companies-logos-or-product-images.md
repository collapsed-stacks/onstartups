I am seeking to start a promotional website for a specific business platform and have descriptions of companies and their products on it. These descriptions include what type of products they have, if the company does charitable work and if they are particularly environmentally efficient, made in the USA, etc. What can I and can't I use? Since it's all promotional and positive I don't see what the problem would be but I'm veering away from using logos just in case. However I feel I should be able to write basic descriptions and post images of their products?
