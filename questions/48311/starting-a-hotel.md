I would like to start a hotel over the next few years. I know I will need a lot of capital to do so. I am working on getting the capital right now but I would like to know what a realistic amount to work for. I would like to buy a small 40 to 80 room hotel, put in a bunch of improvements and get it up and running. I most likely will be opening it up within about 50 miles of Seattle, but that could easily change. I know no one can give an exact number, but could someone least tell me how many zeros to expect and what the leading number might be? 

I am not apposed to franchises. I know that just adds on more costs but they normally have a pretty good ROI. 

Also, right now I am planning on getting a small portion of that amount and getting a loan from a bank for the rest. If this is a bad idea or you know of a better way please let me know. I know there is a lot of risk this way, so any help would be great. 

Lastly, I know _a lot_ about running a hotel. I have spent many years in this industry. I just have never started one before and don't know the first steps. I've been wanting to do this for many years now and I am finally in a place in my life where, except for the fiance issue, I can do this.

Mr.Makai,<br/>
  Its funny to look at your question. When it comes to business you should be alert and effective. Few advice <br/>
1.Why would you buy a existing hotel ? Why do someone will sell theirs ?<br/>
2.No one on this earth can give you the quotation. It varies on your cost-cutting policy, salary schemes, negotiation skills etc.<br/>
3.I dont think you will get loans easily, if you dont show them your income certificates. <br/>
4.Buying a big hotel as a start up business is kinda sounds stupid to me.(No offense i am trying to help you.)<br/>
5.If you're sure about a hotel business, buying a hotel in loss is not a good idea unless if you're legend and already owning couple of hotels. otherwise No-No.<br/>
6.Start small, stick to quality and service , grow up. Thats the best policy.<br/>
7.Getting load, investing everything you have, Taking risk beyond your strength for a startup may end up anywhere. Because you need 10 times of money you actually investing to run the hotel.<br/>
8.To buy Raw materials, salary, furnitures, painting, Chef, cooks, other consumables ..you need a lots of cash to run the business. <br/>
9.Any startup, you cannot expect profit for nearly 2 years.<br/>
10.If your hotel business takes $5000 investment, you atleast need $25000 in bank to run it without flaws.
