Have a client that's asked me if I'd be able to clear tens of thousands of dollars of existing inventory via eBay. While it seems like a stretch, figured I'd look into it for them just to give them some idea of the effort required, and the likely returns/risks involved; it'd also likely be a joint-venture, so the question is as much for them as me.

**What is the best way to get up to speed on the skills required to run an eBay business, and to define if the inventory was auctioned, if it would likely return the expected revenue targets?**

Attempting to keep the question as useful to others as possible, but if it matters, the inventory is a very large collection of American postal stamps/sheets/etc -- and the client is planning to reinvest profits from the sell of the collection to buy and sell more stamps; meaning they are wanting to make an on going business out of this venture.

While the client is targeting eBay, since they currently use eBay -- I have no experience using eBay (though I do have 20,000+ hours building/running websites), and open to other suggestions too; for example, stand-alone-eStore, Amazon, Google, etc. -- though likely not Craigslist, unless compelling reasons are provided.

**UPDATE:** (1) So far I've been unable to find any "good" ultra-dense classes, but this book on by "[The PayPal Official Insider Guide to Growing Your Business][1]" is by PayPal and recent, so at the very least I'd hope it'd match PayPal's point of view on best practices -- and seems okay after looking through it at the local bookstore. (2) See my comments on the answer that suggest "[eBay University Classroom][2]"
 too.
