I am on H1 visa and my spouse is on L1 visa. We both have EADs from my green card filing. We would like to maintain our visa statuses.

Given this scenario, is there a way for us to register a LLC, work for it and pay ourselves?

I have only limited knowledge about visas and EADs, so I forwarded your question to my immigration law colleague, who answered as follows:

"They could work on the EAD cards for their own LLC or any other company in any type of job. It would however violate the terms of the H-1 or L-1 visa by doing so.  So they would have to move over completely to using the EAD card for the side job/work, as well as their main jobs (i.e., the H-1B and L-1 related jobs).  The person on the H-1B could get a concurrent H-1B to do the side work in lieu of using the EAD card for it. That concurrent option is not however available to the L-1 visa holder."
