Sorry for the slightly rubbish question. There was an excellent video I think from the Business of Software conference a few years back which showed as part of it a series of slides indicating what happens when each department tries to do each other departments job. For example, marketing does development had a slide showing a swiss army knife with a ridiculous amount of things on it, sales doing development was I think a tricked out kids bike with every fancy doodad whacked on it and development doing marketing was a shot of Darth Vader. The reason I'm asking about this is I can't find it on the BoS site or through google but think it may be v useful to show some folks at work since were having some all hands meetings discussing how to approach product development and marketing etc in future. If I could find it, it might be a nice way to highlight not everyone can necessarily do everyone else's job.

thanks for any help
