<p>This is incredibly broad. However, here is kind of my 'bucket list' of stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fast internet.</p></li>
<li><p>Private areas for phone/skype calls, one on ones, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Location location location. Needs to be near a cafe, pizza shop and bus line/rapid. Being downtown isn't 'necessary', and in fact could do more harm than good.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.onemoreagileblog.com/2010/01/agile-office-space.html" rel="nofollow">'war room' style office space seems to work well</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Flexibility. If a company wants cubes instead of a war room (or whatever), then they should be able to provide that. </p></li>
<li><p>Meeting space. In addition to the second point, you probably should look for a meeting space for say, 5-12+ people so you can have 'team meetings', meetings with investors etc. But again, it isn't about meetings, it about getting work done.</p></li>
<li><p>Tech incubator specific stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Access to a data center, a deal with RackSpace/AWS/someone else, and if they could have a rack <em>on site</em> for testing and development stuff, that's even better. </p></li>
<li><p>NAS stuff - onsite storage.
-Printers. I spent the majority of my time at the incubator fighting the printers. They are <strong><em>important</em></strong> Important enough that I get paid to do it. </p></li>
<li>QuickBooks - companies can hire an hour or two a month of an accountant to keep the books in shape.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this is a very open-ended question, but that's my bucket list.</p>
