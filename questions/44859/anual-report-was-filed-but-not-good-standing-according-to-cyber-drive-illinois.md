I mailed in the Anual Report (with payment) for the company about a week before it was due but according to the [Cyber Drive Illinois](http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/) it has not been filed and the check has not been cashed.  It is now about a week after the report was due.  Is this something to be concerned about?  If so, whom should I get in contact with?

Illinois SecState office takes time to process filings, especially near the end of the year. I'm sure you won't have any problems so long as the mail wasn't lost entirely. You can call them to confirm:

Probably waiting in the pile of documents there. It took half a year for the California SOS to process my report recently, I'm guessing IL is similarly backlogged. Call them to be sure, but if that's the case - then the date they received it on is the one that matters, not the date when processed (which is going to be somewhere in the future).
