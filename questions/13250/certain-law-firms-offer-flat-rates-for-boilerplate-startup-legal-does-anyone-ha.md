I'm ready to go to the lawyer and have my NDA looked over and my PIA.  I want to do it with a reputable firm in the Silicon Valley area.  Any thoughts?

In my experience, you're going to this deal with the wrong approach. The lawfirm does not expect to review a contract / NDA / incorporation / bylaws or anything else you have made. They expect to use their own boilerplate documents, and their own standard procedures for registering a company etc.

The lawfirm sees this as a loss leader, where they sell you a initial service at a low price, in the hope that you will give them more business in the future. They can offer you this service cheaply because printing a new copy of their boilerplate documents doesn't cost them anything. They probably have internal guidelines on how much human time they can give you, and how much customization of their boilerplate legal documents.

That said, this can be a fine solution in some cases. Presumably the boilerplate legal docs at a large lawfirm with specific industry experience are well tested, fairly comprehensive, and peer reviewed by several lawyers at the firm.

You could try asking if your tasks are a good fit for their flat rate offer. But if you just need a single document reviewed, then I think you'll get a better price by carefully picking the right lawyer, and let him do it on normal 'time and materials' billing basis.

I got a software kit with boiler plate info in it.  Most states want it easy to make a start up so if you have a straight up simple business model that doesn't require complex legal framework to faciliate success then go boiler plate.  

Note not an attorney nor an accountant so you are responsible for your own do dillagence, but best of luck.

You can check out nolo.com for general advice. 

I know that Orrick (http://www.orrick.com/practices/corporate/emergingCompanies/) has a startup arm. They also have some on-line forms, etc. One of my companies used them in the past and they were pretty good.
