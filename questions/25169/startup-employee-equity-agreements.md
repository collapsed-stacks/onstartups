tl;dr: Yes

Long Answer:
Assuming we're talking about an employee equity agreement and not a founder: the most typical arrangement for vesting is four years with a 25% cliff at one year and the rest vesting in 1/36th increments monthly over the next three years.

It's also uncommon for employees to have acceleration by default - you can sometime negotiate a single or double trigger depending on your negotiating position.  If you feel strongly about getting acceleration, don't expect to get full, single trigger acceleration as that tends to create too much of a liability for the company.  Far more common/reasonable is something like a single trigger with 25% acceleration and full acceleration if you're let go within 6 months of the acquisition.
