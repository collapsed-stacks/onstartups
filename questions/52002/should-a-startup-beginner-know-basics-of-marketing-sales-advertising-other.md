<p>Shall i read many books about marketing/sales etc when i just begin startups?</p>

<p>The reason i ask is because no matter what a great developer you are or best program/software/app you have - you can't do much without good marketing of your product(<strong>promoting it</strong>) <strong>AND</strong></p>

<p>potential buyers need to know about it - <strong>advertising</strong></p>

<p>Of course you should ! what did you expect.<br>
I assume it's for an individual company, otherwise the rest of the team takes care of it.<br>
Good news is that you don't have to read many books, just one or two on each topic, because most companies are doing it wrong and few teach it right.<br>
You should read those books long before launching/opening/investing anything as they are likely to make you realise you were going completely the wrong way.</p>

<p>You can read many books and learn it all yourself, but that's time consuming and might not be the best use of your time or skills, as you may be an expert in another area.  If you're willing to pay funds or give away equity, you can recruit a co-founder, hire an employee or contract outside service providers to provide you with sales, marketing and advertising services.  You can then focus on your area of expertise and the other person/people can focus on their areas.</p>

<p>That said, if you go down that route, you should still learn enough to be able to assess the qualifications and performance of the people who you might interview and, eventually, work with.  That way, you can better measure their value and contributions, and develop the most appropriate compensation arrangements.</p>
