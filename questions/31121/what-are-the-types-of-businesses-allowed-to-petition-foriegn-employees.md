I have a person from Belgium with exceptional skills and work ethics who i want and trust to work for me. 

This person can and is willing to help with my company by investing and doing the speciality work all i do is the accounting, managing, supplies and foot work in my company. 

What are the regulations required to have this person live in the U.S to keep my business going? 

This business is in the field of selling plants,landscaping non-traditionally, and development. 

Is this type of business considered a viable one for seeking the skills i need for growth and find in the skills of growing, transplanting, and the creativeness of this person i have not seen or can find in my location?

I believe you can help sponsoring and stating you have work for them. </li>
<li>Is the government likely to award a green card to a person who is in horticulural business? I can't really comment on this other than to say, it depends on how you sell it to the government departments. IF you put it in terms of key skills required for growing a US business then they probably will not complain.</li>
