I am 16, and live in North Carolina. I want to start a software company. I have made some programs that could make some money, and I would like to start an LLC. Is this possible? If not, is there someway I can still sell my programs?

No reason why you can't.  The NC Secretary of State has a form Articles of Organization which you can fill out, sign and submit with a check for $125.  They also provide a handy guide for organizing LLCs at http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/pdf/LimitedLiabilityCompany.pdf

Now, whether or not it's a good idea is a completely separate question. For that, talk with an attorney.
