With most things that you target smaller businesses/organizations you have three ways to reach them. 

 - Google AdWords
 - Cold calling
 - Community access, meeting your buyers in person

AdWords is effective for people who know they want something. Sometimes these are qualified buyers and you can turn them right into actual buyers with minimal effort. However, you'll also get a lot of people who are just looking for someone and need to research before they are even really in a buying cycle. 

Cold calling is a lot of hard work. It means someone spending the whole day on the phone reaching out to organizations. Churches might be a good target to do cold calling because they have offices and they might be more interested in listening to what you have to say just to be polite! :) You can also outsource cold calling buy providing a script and they turn around and send you a list of semi-qualified leads. 

Lastly, getting involved with these organizations through community type events. This is making relationships and learning how to make them pay off. It's also a lot of work but you'll find you can meet people who are interesting and it's a lot more fun than cold calling. For small businesses, locally you can reach out to the chamber of commerce or any startup/small business associations/groups in your area. If you have a vertical selected you can also go to conferences and trade shows in that vertical.

Either call customers directly, or pay a meeting booking company to do this for you.
