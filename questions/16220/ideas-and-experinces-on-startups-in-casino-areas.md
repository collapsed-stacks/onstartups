Recently, my home town located on the border between Greece and Macedonia (small town 20K citizens) is getting more new casinos (currently 3 average large 5 stars hotel casinos and 5 small electronic casinos) mostly aimed for Greek clients (99%). 

We had an idea that maybe a chips manufacturing or anything related with the casinos is a good startup opportunity. Any idea of someone experienced with this kinds of startups related with casino areas like Las Vegas or Atlantic City is welcomed to share.

My personal experience is with software so anything related to this industry will be also very helpful.

Thanks ahead.

Casinos feed many other business, from entertainment to taxis, to travel.  You will have to take a closer look at yourself and find out what type of business you would enjoy owning.  

If you ask me I would be interested in online gaming and marketing.
If you ask my best friend, he would be interested in renting exotic cars to travelers.

My point is, there are a lot of options, it depends on your own personal preference.

I used to live in an area with casinos and one of the businesses that I was surprised to see was 24 hour childcare. Parents would drop their kids off, go gamble the night away then pick the kids up on their way home. Probably not what you're looking for, but it always struck me an example of a great idea that I wouldn't have thought of.
