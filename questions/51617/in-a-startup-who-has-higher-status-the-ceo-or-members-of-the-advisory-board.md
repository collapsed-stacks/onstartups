<p>I'm a member of an advisory board for a startup.  I know that it is important to navigate status carefully in business, but in this situation, who has higher status: the CEO or members of the advisory board?</p>

<p>The CEO is excellent; he's a self-starter and is gaining a lot of traction, and I have full confidence that the company will do well.  The members of the advisory board are mostly senior people in the industry or similar industries.  I'm a lawyer.</p>

<p>The CEO is very respecful of my schedule (indicating that he thinks that I have status) and frequently invites me to key meetings (which is a compliment), but I think that he has status in that he's superb and he could get rid of me anytime, and he's superb.  I'd be willing to be an investor and the CEO has me in mind as someone who could provide about  10% of the company's seed round of financing.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Thanks.</p>

<p>An advisory board is an informal structure of external people that the company wants to include in some high-level thinking.</p>

<p>In terms of status, it goes somewhat like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>board of directors (the real board, the one with power to fire the CEO in particular)</li>
<li>the CEO</li>
<li>VPs, CTO</li>
<li>advisory board</li>
<li>director of xxx</li>
</ul>
