I am thinking of hiring my staff from my competitor's firm, are there any legal issues in doing so? Both for my firm and for the new joining staff member?

Additional details: To be more specific, I am planing to hire the director of sales with a salary and equity and he will come with some good industry contacts. The employment state is NJ.

Depends on if the employee signed an enforceable non-compete contract.  Honestly even an unenforceable one might be problematic because even if they can't win they might still sue you into oblivion.

<p>In practice, companies hire people away from their competitors all the time. The legal effects in the US depend a lot on the state.</p>

<p>In California, with some unusual exceptions, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=382002233%200%200%200&amp;WAISaction=retrieve" rel="nofollow">section 16600 of the Business and Professions code</a> generally makes non-compete clauses <a href="http://lawzilla.com/content/noncompete.shtml" rel="nofollow">illegal and unenforceable</a>. That doesn't mean a competitor in California couldn't sue you or the employee, just that it would probably be a very quick court case.</p>

<p>Around Silicon Valley, I've seen tons of people jump ship to direct competitors and nobody says boo.</p>

<p>I gather things in Texas (for instance) are quite different, and the law and courts there seem quite happy to support non-compete clauses.</p>

IANAL, but a) it depends on if the employee has a non-compete signed with the competitor, b) the state and its legal behavior wrt non-competes, and c) the competitor's war coffers versus yours.

Unless there are really crazy benefits to open up that can of worms, I'd stay out.
