Do you speak German? On a side note I run a (very small) forum at httP://www.imgerman.com that we just started for fun. There might be people there that can help you out. 

I'd suggest connecting with other Germans who live in the US who maybe used to run businesses in Germany... including the guys who run www.germany-usa.com (a cross-culture job board) 

Vielen Gluck mit Ihren Idee!
