I am looking to create a clothing line, and know exactly the style I want, how the graphics should look, etc...the problem is while I have plenty of vision, I do not have the ability to translate what my mind sees to my hands!!

I am looking for a design team to create the graphic images for me, based on descriptions I provide - I am also looking to be highly involved with the process.

What kinds of firms should I be looking at?  What sort of costs should I expect to budget for each design pattern?

Thanks!

The answer is very simple: CROWDSPRING.COM 

This is how it works:

1. You post your project (with as much info as possible, donÂ´t be lazy :-)) with the price and deadline of your choice.
2. Freelancers will study your offer and give you their prototypes. The average project receives 80 prototypes.
3. Choose one.

Good luck!

Yeah, you take your chances with spec sites like Crowdspring. The whole process is flawed. Find someone who's work you like, get to know them and get comfortable with how they work, and you'll be on the right track. And as always, you get what you pay for.

As a designer, I have to agree with the anti-Crowdspring sentiments. Crowdspring and 99designs ask freelancers to work for free essentially. Only the winning finished piece of work is rewarded with payment. That means that if 20 designers created a finished piece of artwork, only one of the nineteen will get paid. It devalues the design profession and depresses prices.

I don't know of any doctors or lawyers that would work for free or any clients that would accept their services if they did.

I agree that sometimes working with freelancers can be hit or miss. That's why it is important that the client carefully review the portfolio of the individual or studio in question to vet the style and experience and, if need be, solicit referrals.  

There is a great studio based here in Madrid, Spain that works a lot with fashion and club clients: www.serialcut.com.

Here is a directory of good design studios, much of them based in the U.K.:

Of course there is also my studio! Good luck.

Ryan- I am not clear on whether you are looking for design for clothing or brand identity for your clothing line. The Ralph Lauren horse is his brand ID and of course in certain places he uses it on his clothing just by itself. If you are looking for designs for t-shirts its something different, if you are looking for fabric design (pattern design) again its something else. As far as design needing to scale I recommend you don't worry about that right now. If you work with a professional designer, they all know how to produce the designs and they will deliver in a format that it would scale but depending on what you are looking for every process requires a different type of file.

I own a design company. Would be happy to help you with you design needs if you like the style of work on www.innasokolskaya.com

On there is my contact information, get in touch with me and let me know that you are from onstartups.com and I will give you a great rate. 

All my design is satisfaction guaranteed, so with the price quote are included unlimited revisions. I will also provide graphic support for you to make all the files print ready and if you need any other format in the future I will be happy to provide that for you as well. 

Crowdspring is spec work, and it is considered extremely unethical in the design community. I addition to designers doing free work, the result is usually a generic, personality-less result. On top of that you end up paying much more than you would have regularly. 

I would recommend to create a good business relationship with a designer/firm and work in that way.
The more you work together the more the designer gets a feeling for your style and taste and that is what gets your the really unique, creative results you are looking for.

Hope this helps, cheers,
Inna

<p>Our website <a href="http://www.designcrowd.com" rel="nofollow">DesignCrowd.com (a good alternative to the crowdsourcing services above)</a> gives designers guaranteed participation payments so that they get paid even if their design is not selected.  It is a fairer process and leads to higher quality results.</p>

<p>One way to gauge what your budget should be is to see what other people are offering in <a href="http://contests.designcrowd.com" rel="nofollow">recent design contests</a> and the results they're getting.</p>
