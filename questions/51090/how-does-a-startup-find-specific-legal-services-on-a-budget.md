<p>I have a company that's selling the core technologies of the business and the co-founders are entering into employment with the purchasing company (the company is not being sold). </p>

<p>How can we find legal help for this one transaction and how can we find a range for expected cost? We do not retain any legal resources and are on a tight budget. </p>

<p>Is there a marketplace for legal services?</p>
