<p>I've been working with a guy to get a new startup off the ground, and have a base agreement for % ownership, though the contractual agreement hasn't been put together yet (been working with him on it for a few months).  The company was setup over a year ago with the FMV set at that point.  We're now about to take funding that values the company at significantly more that the stock price we had agreed upon.</p>

<p>I've seen notice that the FMV needs to be set within the prior year, and that it needs to take into consideration all material information.  Since the FMV is over a year old, and the with pending funding, am I at risk for owing taxes to the IRS on the spread from the original FMV (assuming I purchase the shares at that price) and a whatever the funding values the company at if I do the 83(b) election now just prior to the funding event?</p>

<p>You cannot do the 83(b) election when you feel like it. You have to do it within the 30 days of the grant date. From your description, the grant date was over a year ago. That ship has sailed.</p>

<p>That said, I'm not a tax professional, so do talk to a EA/CPA licensed in your state, and do it ASAP.</p>
