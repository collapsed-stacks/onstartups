This one is relatively new, but it looks promising because of the networking aspect: http://tradeshift.com/

I've used the VtigerCRM invoicing module and it serves its purpose. But I'm sure there's a SugarCRM equivalent that's much more powerful.

<p>There are lots of online invoicing tools. Really depends what all you want as they each seem to have strengths and weaknesses.  </p>

<p>For consulting type services</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.getcashboard.com/" rel="nofollow">CashBoard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com" rel="nofollow">FreshBooks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>are great.</p>

<p>If you are primarily doing product invoices and you don't really care if your customers pay online or get automatically reminded that they owe you money you can use.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://quickbooksonline.intuit.com/" rel="nofollow">Quick Books Online</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Quickbooks has much better reporting, expense tracking and is a full accounting package</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lessaccounting.com/" rel="nofollow">Less Accounting</a> is primarily accounting but has basic invoicing</li>
</ul>

<p>My favorite is Cashboard because I primarily do consulting type services, but it works good for product type billing. Customers can pay online and get reminded when they owe you money.  You can also configure it to integrate with a 3rd party system so when you 'print' an invoice that other company prints, stuffs and mails it... not you.  Freshbooks also has that feature.</p>

<p>I cannot find the link on the Intuit site, but I have used the <a href="http://download.cnet.com/QuickBooks-Simple-Start-Free-Edition/3000-2066_4-10608523.html" rel="nofollow">Quickbooks Simple Start Free Edition</a> for a couple of years.</p>

I've used amphis for invoicing and contacts for a couple of years now and I'm very happy with it. comes with free support and upgrades which is great. I use it on a network shared with 4 other PCs but it can also be used stand-alone. they have a 30 day trial you can download. www.amphis-software.com

<p>I would go in to <a href="http://www.buissy.com" rel="nofollow">Buissy.com</a>, Capterra.com or Web-based-software.com. I believe you will find good online invoicing tools there, especially in one of the 2 first.</p>
