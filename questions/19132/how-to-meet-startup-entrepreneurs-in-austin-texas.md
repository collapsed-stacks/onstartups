Can any Austinites recommend good networking events for meeting other startup entrepreneurs?  The [TechRanch][1] looks promising - what else should I check out?  I'll be in Austin soon and would like to get a feel for what the software startup scene there is like.

<p>Tech Ranch has a decent community around it (our Austin office is there, but there's a lot of individuals there as well). Also <a href="http://austinstartup.com" rel="nofollow">AustinStartup.com</a> is a good place to keep up to date with entrepreneurial news for the area.</p>

The Austin Startups Facebook Group is the best place to start. It's pretty active.
