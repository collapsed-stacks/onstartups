I would ask you something that is a problem for me: sell my website. This website is a blog, a forum and a "database" of anime and manga (as imdb) built with Zend Framework. It has many daily visits (14k-15k) and daily page views (60k).

Is there a best pratics to sell a website? I thought about contacting some companies of sector but is difficult and I don't know the price to ask. I tought about ebay but I thought again about the companies on ebay... It is impossible :(

Can the community help me?

PS: sorry for my english...

What is the website url? What is the content? Do you have verifiable traffic?  Revenue? All these things factor into the valuation of the site.

I second Damians advice - spend some time looking at http://flippa.com listings and see which are closest to your product, if they sell, and what they go for. Is there a key US competitor? Why not go after them first to determine if the model works in the US. Then, you gather some stats, See if you make a difference in the US, then offer a product that works in two marketplaces.

http://flippa.com/ seems to be an interesting place. I have not used it yet.

I sell manga to public and school libraries.  I do not know who or how much someone would buy your website for but contacting people in the industry who may be potentially interested and inquiring is a good starting point.  The key US manga publishers are VIZ, Tokyopop, Del Rey (Random House), Yen Press (Hachette Book Group), Dark Horse, DC Comcis.  There is also a pop culture news service at www.icv2.com. I also use  www.animenewsnetwork.com and www.mangaupdates.com when I want to find manga reviews.

I am not up to date on the anime side.
