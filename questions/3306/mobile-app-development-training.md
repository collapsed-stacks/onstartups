I am Shailendra Sinhasane, founder of startup [MobisoftInfotech.com][1] mobile application development company. We do iphone & android development currently and planning to expand to major platforms. Our portfolio comprise of more than 30 iPhone & 10 android apps successfully delivered. We also have training facility available at the same time to take an advantage of being one of the 1st specialized mobile app development company. We are in Houston, USA and India.

Question: Whether to continue with training facility or not? Because of fear of creating competitors for my company in India. I may get couple of B2B associations however they are less profitable. I am fetching projects from USA customers, need to get advise on social marketing to reach B2B associations in USA to be more profitable? Shall I also go for product development?

It would be highly appreciable to get your inputs.

Thank you.

I agree with Usman Sheikh's analysis of the the business, and I would add that your 'potential competitors' are going to get training somewhere and create competitive products anyway, so unless your are giving away proprietary information I don't think it should be a factor in your analysis

You could offer training to other countries that are difficult to compete with you due to currency rate differences.

Shailendra it appears that you have two questions:

A. Whether to continue with training facility or not? (In India I am presuming)

How much time are core members of your team currently dedicating to the training facility? What % of your current revenue is derived from training? It appears from your introduction that training is a small component of your overall revenue stream and it isn't as profitable as development. In that case it is not really about training your competitors which is a concern, rather it is not optimally allocating resources on a division. The mobile development training space is quite hot these days and maybe you could convert your current courses to e-learning programs that people from all over the world could take and pay you in Dollars rather than in Rupees. This would boost margins and provide scalability. If this is not possible I would advise focusing your resources in the development space.


B. Need to get advise on social marketing to reach B2B associations in USA to be more profitable? Shall I also go for product development?

This question is very vague. Social marketing to reach B2B associations is a very broad segment. What you need to do is narrow your focus into specific niche's where you will be able to target with greater accuracy. The second part of your question I think pertains to whether you should pitch for product development projects along side your training. With the amount of demand these days this is a very good space to be in and I would encourage you in ramping up your presence in the US. There are many conferences and trade shows that you could go to. This would boost your visibility in the US.
