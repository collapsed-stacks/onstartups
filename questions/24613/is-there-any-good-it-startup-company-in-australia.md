http://www.ipitch.com.au/ is arguably the best known, with good synopses of the companies. It's also kept current - I'm sure if you look today there will be new companies (and company ideas) posted there today. Good luck.

<p>Going to <a href="http://thehive.org.au/" rel="nofollow">The Hive</a> and other networking events is also a great way to meet entrepreneurs that are working on interesting stuff.</p>
