I'm on an F-1 visa. Would it be possible to be a co-founder (other founders being US citizens) in a startup incorporated as a C-corp.

Thanks

Check the below points.

1) Do you have enough money to start a company?
2) Can your company provide employment to at least 25 US citizens?
3) For safe side do the founder is US citizen?

If the above matches find a lawyer and convert your visa from F1 to business visa. But all you need is that your founder(s) [Who are citizens of US] should give assurance letter which to accept you as their co-founder. Meet your lawyer with that letter. He will look after rest.
I guess its not a big task and the lawyers looks after it.
