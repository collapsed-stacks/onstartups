I will be starting an LLC with 2 other members and have the follwoing questions about where to LLC or Incorporate:

Basic outline of the organization:

2 of the partners will be residing in WI and the 3rd partner is a citizen of Mexico who resides in Mexico and that status will not change. 

The physical business (trucking) to start will be operating in only in the state of Texas upon startup & a few years thereafter. 

The two partners in WI will be working from home, but offering no actual business services in the state of WI. 

I will be doing the traveling to Texas to get the business off the ground and operate it. I may move there in the future as the operation grows. This isn't a necesity as Trucking can grow anywhere.


Questions I have are this:

If the business is being operated physically in Texas but 2 of the owners live in WI, where should we incorporate? 

If we live in WI and the business is incorporated in TX, will our personal tax (either as pass-through or corporate) be calculated for payment in TX or WI or both? I'm aware that TX has no personal income tax; therefore, will we get this benefit if we incorporate in TX but live in WI? 

If we incorporate in TX, will we have to register in WI as a foreign operation in WI b/c two of the owners are residens of WI and/or because we will be 'working from home' for some of the duties to operate the company in texas?  Like I noted, we will not be offering any services directly to any business in WI.


How are Taxes to be paid by the Mexican Citizen in our partnership?


Please let me know if you need additioanl clarification on any of the points/qustions I've outlined.

Thanks for the help!

<h1>General State Tax Principles</h1>

<p>Here are some general rules (forgive the lack of specifics, but many more facts are required before a valid opinion could offered):</p>

<p><strong>Legal Entity</strong> - If you operate as a general partnership or sole proprietor (with no separate legal entity), you will only be subject to tax based on where you have nexus (discussed later).</p>

<p><strong>State of Incorporation/Formation</strong> - Generally, at a minimum, you will pay an annual fee to this jurisdiction (I believe that both Delaware and Nevada treat LLC's this way). Typically, these fees are published on the state's website. Many states will also apply a tax on gross revenue or outstanding shares or some other metric. This often varies depending on the entity type (C,S, LLC, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Nexus (when you become subject to state tax)</strong> - Technically, within any state which you are deemed to have nexus, you will be subject to tax and may also be required to "qualify" for doing business in that state. Taxes can include sales, use and income tax. Nexus definitions will vary between states, can get fairly technical and often require use of a legislated formula to allocate profits among the qualifying jurisdictions (don't forget local taxes levied by municipalities), so you should definitely consult with a professional. Otherwise, you risk getting picked up on the radar of the State Revenue Dept. and could be subject to audit, fines and possibly even criminal fraud charges. </p>

<p>I've probably left a lot out, but a competent CPA should be able to advise you on the specific issues... Good luck!</p>

<p><em>Side Note</em>: State tax compliance is a messy process, so support efforts by politicians to harmonize state laws. The federal government does have the right to regulate interstate commerce, but little has been done to ease the administrative burden on small businesses.

Generally, you pay taxes where the business is located.  So, for example, if you were located in and did business in Texas, the tax would be paid in Texas. 

The situation becomes trickier because the business is in TX, but you are performing the "work" from Wisconsin.  So the question becomes, how essential is what you do to the running of the business?  If the business couldn't operate without you, then Wisconsin will argue that your money is "Wisconsin Sourced Income" which means it will be taxed in Wisconsin.  Moreover, if your wages get put into a Wisconsin bank account, Wisconsin will also have a good argument that you should be taxed there. 

Texas has a Tax on LLCs as a business tax even though there is no personal income tax so you'll have to pay that as well. 

For the Mexican citizen, he is subject to what the IRS calls "Foreign Partner Withholding Rules" which state that anytime you have a member of an LLC who is not a US citizen, you need to withhold tax from his wages and pay it over to the IRS before you pay him directly.  Some states have similar rules and enforce it fairly strictly so you should begin to withhold from his wages and pay it over to the government before you pay him. 

This is just an overview but you should really seek the guidance of a tax professional to work out your situation in full.
