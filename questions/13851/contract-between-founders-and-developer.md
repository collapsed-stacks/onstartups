I'm working with 2 people that I have never met before on a startup (we're all located in different parts of the world - USA, Europe, North Africa.) We want to sign some kind of contract indicating our specific roles, the percentage of the company we own (if we were to incorporate), what the procedure is if one of us decides to leave, and how revenue will be distributed. What is the best way to go on about this? Are there any free alternatives?

The best way is to hire a lawyer. Given that each of you is in a different country, it'll be difficult (and hence more costly) to draft a contract that is legally binding.

Can it be done cheaper? Sure, google for "contract form" and you'll find plenty of places giving you standard contracts for free or small (compared to what a lawyer costs) fee. But you do have to understand that if a contract was not vetted by a lawyer or not tailored to your specific needs, you run a risk of the contract not being enforceable. Whether you're willing to take this risk, it's up to you.

Just my two cents.

Ask for a layer support since you're going to setup up a company (a LLC, INC or whatever). He is the right person to drive you in a proper founding act.
