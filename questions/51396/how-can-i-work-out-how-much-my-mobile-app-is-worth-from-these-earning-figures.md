<p>A CEO of a bigger company has contact me today asking if I am interesting in selling my Android application. He is asking for the numbers straight away and how much I want to sell it for.</p>

<p>The app has been in the market for almost a year. These are the earnings from the app for the last three months</p>

<p>July: $2300</p>

<p>August: $2700</p>

<p>September: $3800</p>

<p>How can I workout how much it is worth?</p>

<p>Should I tell him the earnings, and number of users etc?</p>

<p>DO NOT GIVE HIM NUMBERS!!!!
Until he signs an NDA, beyond that do not discuss any operations until a Letter of Intent is signed.<br>
What usually is of interest in an M&amp;A are full details. I.E. your financial statements, your accountant would need to work those out, but they are for later.<br>
What he likely needs is earnings, i.e. revenue, and expenses. To basically see what is profitable.<br>
They will also likely need a number of users, number of paid users, etc<br>
As far as estimates go, it's difficult to figure out. Rule of thumb it's 3 years EBIDTA, but gets wayyy more complicated with intellectual property, branding, etc</p>
