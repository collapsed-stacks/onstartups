Most states do not require an LLC to publicly disclose the names of its members.  Where are the LLC's members recorded? Is it only in the Operation Agreement? I know ownership is assigned in the Operating Agreement, is this the only location the ownership information is recorded? Where physically is this document stored usually?

Owners of LLCs are "members" (rather than shareholders).

Yes, the Operating Agreement identifies the members and their respective ownership interests. The OA generally should be kept at the LLC's principal executive office with other LLC records (though it is common for lawyers to maintain these items for their clients).
