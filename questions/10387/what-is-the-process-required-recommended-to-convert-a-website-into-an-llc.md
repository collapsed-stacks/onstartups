Given that I have a website that is making revenue, live in California, and would like it to be claimed under an LLC, what is the process to accomplish this? Should I be forming a sole proprietorship LLC or an S-Corporation LLC? I am the sole owner/developer of the website. What is the best way to proceed?

<p>You don't convert a website into an LLC per se. A website is just an asset that is owned by a person, LLC or corporation.</p>

<p>There are actually several different structures you can form. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sole-Proprietorship</li>
<li>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</li>
<li>S-Corporation</li>
<li>C-Corporation</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these structures are different and have different advantages and disadvantages. See this <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/3097/are-llc-and-s-corporation-the-same-thing-what-are-the-differences" rel="nofollow">thread</a> for a discussion about LLC's and S-Corporations.</p>

<p>Since you are the only owner, you would probably form a single-owner LLC if you wanted the liability protection.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/448/different-ways-to-incorporate-your-startup" rel="nofollow">question</a> also gives a good explanation of the different structures.</p>

<p>The question that you posed comes up frequently. Please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/08/14/should-i-form-an-llc-or-a-corporation/" rel="nofollow">Should I form an LLC or a corporation?</a> and the links from that post. (My blog has, in addition, many other posts that you may will find helpful.)</p>

<p>BTW, a sole proprietorship is different from an LLC (single-member or otherwise), which is different from a corporation (S or otherwise).</p>
