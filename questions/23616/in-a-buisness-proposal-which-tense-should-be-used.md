Which tense would you use in a business proposal?

Most people either go with first or third person ie:

"we proposes this marketing plan"
or
"company x proposes this marketing plan"

Which tense do you feel is most appropriate, and why? Does it matter?

I prefer we since it makes it more real in terms of someone actually is behind it. If you use the company x method, it just seems hollow.

You want the plan to be easy to read and have the passion come out. Company X just does not have passion. We or I does.
