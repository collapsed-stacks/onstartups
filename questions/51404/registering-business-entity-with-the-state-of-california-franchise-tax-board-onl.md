<p>I am trying to register my LLC with the State of California Franchise Tax Board <a href="https://ftb.ca.gov/online/Access_Your_Account/index.asp" rel="nofollow">online</a> so that I can pay the $800 fee, etc. In the registration process, they are asking for </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Year of the tax return (Form 568)</p>
  
  <p>Original return only, not amended returns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the options are only 2012 and before. Why is 2013 not available? Should I select 2012 even though my LLC was registered just a few weeks back? </p>

<p>Also, what do I enter for the </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Total Income from Line 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not even sure what Line 1 is. </p>

<p>You cannot do that, since you've never filed CA tax return for your LLC (form 568). You'll have to send a paper <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2013/13_3522.pdf" rel="nofollow">form 3522</a> with a check. After you file your first yearly tax return, you can sign up for the electronic system.</p>
