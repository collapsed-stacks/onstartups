We have a small business that needs a webhosting solution.  We will probably be able to support the following:

 1. Login to set up a shopping cart software (Magento most likely).
 2. Unlimited bandwidth
 3. Fairly large storage capacity.
 4. Fairly cheap. ($30/mo would be expensive under $20 would be preferred)

I am assuming that domain registration and email accounts are a given in all of these solutions.


I've already looked at <http://www.magentocommerce.com>, <http://www.fatcow.com>.  I'm going to pass on [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) previous experience suggests that management of sites and domains hosted by them is a monumental pain.

I would look at http://www.1and1.com. They are pretty fine, as long as you don't need support (I never needed it).

I've had good experience with them in the past. They also have tons of coupons if you Google for them. I got my first month for just a cent.

Have you looked at Bluehost.com link?  It's incredibly cheap ($3.95/month) and we've had good success with it running several blogs, and WP based sites on it.  I'm pretty sure they support Magento.  Depending on your longterm goals, it may just be an option, but it's one worth checking out.  

If you do go down that path: http://www.bluehost.com/track/gavinbaker (it's my affilate link).

<p>Cheap web hosting (~$5/mo) is basically a commodity these days, and there are dozens of services that will fit your needs. However, most of these companies keep their prices down by skimping on services.</p>

<p>When I first got started with web hosting, I signed up for a super cheap package with Just Host (don't use them) that worked fine for a few weeks. But when I had a simple request (wanted to change apache configuration so URLs wouldn't need ".php" extensions) it took them almost a week to respond, and then another few days to actually make the change.</p>

<p>If you're going to build a business around a website, you need much higher quality service than that. You can probably imagine how frustrating it would be to wait a week for a response if your server crashes or needs some kind of critical maintenance. Dismal service means lost customers and revenue.</p>

<p>As I said, the actual server hardware is basically a commodity. What you want to shop around for is the service that backs it all up. You want a number that you can call 24/7/365, in case something breaks in the middle of the night on Christmas. You want people who are geeky and highly knowledgeable about their equipment, so they know how to help.</p>

<p>For that, the only company I'd recommend is <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/" rel="nofollow">Rackspace</a>. I've been blown away by their friendly, helpful support staff multiple times, and have moved all of my sites to their servers.</p>

Have you decided on the website developer and basic design? Suggest you first decide on the content of your website, a vendor and other design issues. There are many hosting companies which will fit your need.

Once you decide on the vendor, seek their opinion as well.
