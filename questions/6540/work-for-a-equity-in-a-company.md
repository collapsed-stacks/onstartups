I have an opportunity to work as an independant rep for a company that has three owners. A woman president, her husband COO, and a third party who has the experience in the business. The married couple don't have any experience in the industry and they hired one sales person who is new to the business as well. I have 15 years in the business and can bring more than clients to the table, I understand the process and industry at various levels. They are open to something but not sure yet as they just purchased the company in October. Its very unorganized at this point and they are scrambling to get old clients and new. Is there any standard format w/regard to vesting, strike price in relation to a % of ownership? Where can I find resorces on this. The company is private so I don't have much history.

I would not touch this "opportunity" with a 10 foot pole.

1. Family run company - lots of bagage you don't want to deal with.
2. Married couple with no deep experience - RUN!
3. Recently acquired company - current customers might be loyal to previous owners and don't want to deal with newbies.
3. Equity.

Sounds like you really should be starting your company instead. Getting into business with bunch of people with no real experience is a recipe for disaster, lost opportunities, money out the window. Been there, done that, and would like to erase that from my memory.

<p><strong>re: vesting:</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The standard vesting schedule for
  startup companies is four years with a
  one year cliff and monthly vesting
  thereafter until the founders reach
  100%. -- <a href="http://thestartuplawyer.com/incorporation/why-your-startups-founders-stock-should-vest-over-time" rel="nofollow"><em>The Startup Lawyer</em></a></p>

<p><strong>re: equity &amp; strike price:</strong></p>

<p>This is really very specific to your situation. The first step to determining any of it is to figure out what the market opportunity is for the company, and what's a reasonable valuation.</p>

<p>To determine what percentage of the equity you (and the others) should receive, some questions to answer are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who's taking risk, and how much?</li>
<li>What's the value of what everyone is bringing to the table?
<ul>
<li>Is anyone bringing things that the company can't do without?</li>
<li>Are there time-sensitive aspects of the value? (e.g. A person who can bring in 20 clients in the first month might be worth more than someone could could bring in more clients, but over a longer period of time.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What responsibilities does each person have?</li>
<li>What's the relationship between equity and control? (e.g. the married couple may be willing to go below 51% ownership if they have clear decision rights on issues that matter most to them.)</li>
<li>What opportunities are you sacrificing by pursuing this one? If you quantify the monetary value of those opportunities, what does that mean the minimum value of this one must be to you to make it worth it?</li>
</ul>

It sounds like this company has some history so the first thing I would ask to look at is the books. The second thing would be the deal between the three owners. 

If it's structured as an LLC, then there is no vesting or anything like that. It's straight up ownership.

If it's a C-corporation, then vesting comes into play for Stock Options. Common stock would be an outright ownership, just like an LLC.

Jay makes some excellent points about the questions you need to ask. The critical thing to understand is what you want and have the data to back it up.

In this case, you might want to base some of your compensation on sales you bring in. If they are really disorganized, then that might be a good way to show your direct affect on the business that is measurable.

You are probably at a slight disadvantage since the three owners have put up the initial investment to buy the company and how you come in to dilute their ownership. So, pay attention to that dynamic and how they deal with that.
