I`m a social community website founder. By only one person, I make the site have over 8000+ members and about 100,000 Alexa rank. A kind of some famous social community in my country. But it is still not a company yet.

And there are over 7 VCs and Angel investors contacted me before including IDG Capital in my country. But I want to established my business as a company located on American especially California, and VCs want me to make a strong team, especially the team members with some well-famous company working background historically, before the investment.

Although I`m not in American and I have no enough money to be attractive for other talents at present, I really want to know how to and where I can find CMO or Director of Publicity as co-founder who is I think it is really important for my current status.

We knew that we can find excellent technological person from some technological websites like Stackoverflow, and find excellent designer from some designer websites, but how to find excellent CMO or Director of Publicity from the Internet?

Is it possible to headhunt talent to join me together from county to other county before the investment?

Additionally, I also looking for CFO. I want to get to know to the way too.

Or any ideas or suggestions? Thanks!

Many senior executives which will bring predigee to your portfolio flock around VC firms in the disguise of consultants. Developing relationships with them in this natural setting has proven an effective way to trap them. I reccomend a trail of breadcrumb offers to prospective lucrative consulting engagements to lead them to your door. Do note that such CMO and CEO types-  especially those which as much meat as plummage- have a keen sense of smell to distinguish between startups that have great talk, and those that will be able to feed their iinsatiable diets. Good luck hunting.

Don't rush, take your time. Hiring is one the most important decisions you'll make. 

Try this:

 - LinkedIn
 - Social Media websites and blogs such as David Meerman Scott's blog: one of the best gurus of social media. He is followed by tens of thousands of people in the industry. 
 - Monster.com and other jobs sites. The key here is to come up with a well crafted ad that communicates the beliefs and mission of your business.

If you have a big budget, you can use professional headhunting services. They are easy to find online. It seems that your business is growing, so it may be worth the investment. Knight Hamilton comes to mind, based in London, but there are many others. 

Good luck.
