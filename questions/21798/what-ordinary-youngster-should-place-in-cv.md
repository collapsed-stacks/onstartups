You should put you biography, shortly education and experience if any. Employers understand that you have short CV.

If your approaching me, then I would like to see what you have done that is relevant to my field. Show me your not just going for any job but your going for a job you have a passion for.

EG. Software development company: 

 1. Played a lot of computer games 
 2. Tried to write my own computer game
 3. Written my own website
 4. Have a stackoverflow Rep

Basically anything that shows you have a keen interest and are going to get into your work ... and not waste my time.

Education is kind of expected by at your age, unless you have done some unusal subjects or specific subject then its the same as everyone else.

You should expand as much as you can in education and extra curricular activities.

The most important thing to put in a CV is you skill set. What programming languages (e.g. C#,Java,  etc.) are you proficient in.  What software suites are you proficient in.. e.g Microsoft Office, etc. What languages besides Polish do you speak well enough to answer the phone for me or participate in a Skype discussion.

As a potential employer, I'm not concerned with your school grades or whether you were the lead in your school play. I just want to know what you can do for me.

Oh, and if you're a budding programmer, code some modules for an OpenSource project. This is the single best way for a programmer to prove his technical chops.

Good Luck.
