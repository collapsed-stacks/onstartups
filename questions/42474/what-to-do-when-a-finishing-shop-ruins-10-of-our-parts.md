## What to do when a finishing shop ruins 10% of our parts?

Our brand new company has had 200 sets of aluminum parts machined.

We then took them to another shop that grained and anodized the parts for us.

When we went to pick them up yesterday, they told us that 19 of the parts had been ruined. 

These parts are $25 each, so we assumed that they would be willing to compensate us that amount since we will have to have the 19 that they ruined re-made.

What is the standard protocol when a shop ruins parts?

There isn't a standard answer. Some folk will compensate. Others won't. 

The latter group tend to be cheaper. The former more expensive since they roll wastage costs (which are inevitable to some extent) into the contract price.

"Whatever it says in the contract" is the answer.
