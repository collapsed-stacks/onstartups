I am not a lawyer but I do get this question a lot and this is how I usually answer: 

There are different types of insurance. Without a location you clearly wont need insurance to protect you from what happens when someone slips on the ice on your front walk. But there are other reasons you could be sued.

If someone sues you because the lady accessory they purchased caused them some perceived pain of some type -- do you have the money to defend yourself? 

If the answer to the above is no -- then consider the next question: If I then shut down the entity that they sued -- is the "loss" less than what it would cost in liability insurance? 

If the answer to the above is no -- then I would look into getting an appropriate level of  liability insurance. 

Another option for you to consider since you are doing drop shipping is what type of contractual identification you have from the people you are "reselling" their product. If that is good -- you might want to forego and rely on that. 

Another consideration is the nature of the ladies accessories -- what could be the biggest potential liability? -- if it seems pretty small then perhaps rather than liability insurance you could just go with a pre-paid legal option that covers this and other things? 

Hope that provides some guidance!
