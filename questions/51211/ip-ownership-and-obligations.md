<p>After coming up with an invention, i found a partner and he became 50% patent owner / partner.
6 months after filing for a patent, we became employees for the first time - obligated to the company only during the course of the employment without a pre-invention clause.</p>

<p>Months later he scammed me out of the company and the lawyer demands i sign on future assignments including one of me giving my rights completely.</p>

<p>Am i obligated to do so? and for a small consideration fee?</p>

<p>During my short 'employment' i wasn't involved in anything and the IP work was conducted prior to me becoming an employee in the company i myself founded.</p>
