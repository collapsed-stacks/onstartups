Up until very recently we were doing all support through our support e-mail address. However, as the business grows, it is getting harder and harder to follow through support requests and dispatch them effectively. 

Do you have any recommendation on CRM/support software that could help us out ? Our principal requirement is that it has to integrate well with e-mail and let us dispatch support requests between 2-3 employees.

What is the distinction between CRM and support software ? Which one should we get considering we are an e-commerce business (our software is custom) selling consumer electronics ?

I've heard a lot of positive reviews concerning Salesforce.com but I feel it might be too big/expensive for us yet (we receive <50 e-mails per day on average).

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.zoho.com/crm/free-edition.html" rel="nofollow">zhocrm</a>.  I use the sales and marketing module and found it easy to use/learn and serves my purpose while being free.  Zohocrm has a cases and solution module.  Test it out!</p>

I too have used the free edition of ZohoCRM and can attest to it's usefulness from the get-go. It's more important to use anything you can to keep things organized. As one outgrows that form you could use export the data and move on to something more feature-rich.

If you just want a CRM for sales and appointment management, go with ZohoCRM.  If you have product to sell and you need to send out quotes, go with Info at Hand.  That is what we use and it works great.  It is based on SugerCRM with a few added features.  Also you only need a minimum of 2 users with Info at Hand, but you have to have a minimum of 5 users with SugerCRM.

<p>You might want to look into <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/" rel="nofollow">SugarCRM</a>. Salesforce.com is supposed to be really good, but it also might be way more than you need right now.</p>

Agree with the above about Zoho and Info at Hand. You may also want to test out Highrise by 37signals: http://highrisehq.com/ 

There's also vtigerCRM for larger scale purposes but I'd only recommend it if one of you knows how to install/manage mySQL databases.

<p>My company makes a product called <a href="http://www.helpspot.com" rel="nofollow">HelpSpot Help Desk</a> you might want to checkout. It's focus is help desk not traditional CRM but it sounds like that's primarily what you're looking for. Nearly every company needs a help desk software solution. </p>

<p>If you need a CRM tool is really very particular to your business. If you do a lot of hands on person to person sales (you have a sales team, etc) then a CRM is critical. If you're selling a more generic item via an online store or with slight customization your ecommerce system may provide all the customer information you need. </p>

<p>In most cases it will have the customers info, contact info and sales history which is generally all you need. From there the help desk application can manage the customer interaction process.</p>

<p>One unique aspect of our product is that we presume you have a customer information system already. So rather than try and bundle in a CRM tool you won't use or that's inadequate (99% of help desk tools which include CRM functionality are not very well done) HelpSpot focuses entirely on the customer interaction process and provides simple API hooks to integrate HelpSpot with your CRM/Ecommerce system.</p>

<p>You can also look into <a href="http://vtiger.com/" rel="nofollow">Vtiger CRM</a>. There is also a dedicated hosting service (I'm sure there are others too). You can have a look <a href="http://www.vtigerserver.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

For support I think Zendesk is awesome, CRM go with Bantam Live - great UI, really really practical stuff.

You can glue them together as well, both are quite cheap.

Just FYI. We've customized JIRA bug tracking system as a help desk system, it worked fine with just adding some simple java classes to receive/send emails inbound and outbound.

<p>We've just moved from <a href="http://www.desk.com" rel="nofollow">www.desk.com</a> (its good) to a <a href="http://www.uservoice.com" rel="nofollow">www.uservoice.com</a> (looks better then desk).
With both you can start for free and if it works, pay some small fee and get going nicely.</p>
