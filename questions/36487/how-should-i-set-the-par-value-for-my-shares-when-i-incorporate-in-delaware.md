I will be incorporating in Delaware.  Eventually I plan to hire employees if things go well but for now it's just me; I will be providing all funding out of my own pocket.

To get things started, I estimate that my business will only require about $10,000 to get off the ground.  Now here's my question.  To keep taxes low, I plan to file a Certificate of Incorporation that only allows 5,000 shares to be authorized.  What should I set the par value to?

Should I set the par value such that the amount of shares I plan to sell myself (1,000, for example) when the first shares are authorized are "worth" the $10,000 I plan to invest in the company?  Or can I simply set the par value low (at $0.01, for example) and then voluntarily pay more for the shares?

Since you are currently the sole owner go ahead and set it as low as you like. $0.01 would be fine. It is best to insure that the money you invest is at least equal to par value times number of shares issued. In other words, the initial shares are not sold by the company to you below par.
