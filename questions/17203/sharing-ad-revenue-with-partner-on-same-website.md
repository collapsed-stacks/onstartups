I am considering starting a website with a partner. Revenues will be purely ad related.

Is it ok to use two different Adsense IDs on the same website/webpages? I mean:
would that comply with the Adsense ToS? (I just went quickly through them and could not see anything against having two different Adsense IDs... but I might have missed it).

And does anyone have experience with this kind of setup?

What is a point of using two adsense IDs? You can create different ads, even if they are the same size, and track the performance of those ads.

It may not compete with their TOS, but it isn't a very good idea. Google puts a lot of time into their algorithms (to make more money for you and them), and they probably didn't account for scenarios like that.

If this guy's your partner, you should set-up a joint bank account (or just start a company) and split things from there. This certainly won't be the only "how do we split" questions to come up.

I think I found the answer to my question here in the Adsense FAQ:
