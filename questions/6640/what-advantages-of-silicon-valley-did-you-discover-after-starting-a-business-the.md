Ok, let me apologize for another question about Silicon Valley and the notorious "location" tag, but I have a really revised question here.

While the question sounds the same ("What are the advantages of Silicon Valley to start a business there"), there are some constraints that change the whole gist of 

**the question:**
After you moved from another location where you had been doing your business to Silicon Valley and started a business there - what advantages and disadvantages did you notice comparing to the previous location?

or

While doing your business in Silicon Valley have you ever heard about any advantages or disadvantages of Silicon Valley from other entrepreneurs working in other locations (US, Europe...) that are real from your personal expereince? 

Appendix (Silicon Valley related):

- Did you meet any person that helped you with valuable advice there?

- Have you managed to build a network of yours there and did it really help you with your startup?

- Have all those numerable events, meetings, coffees and conferences in Silicon Valley helped you and brought any value to you?



UPD1. The question is about the web software startup, e.g. a startup that delivers some software technology through the internet (for example, social network, blogging service or a simple crm application).

 That depends on the business. 

 I used to work for a startup that developed hardware systems. The best Silicon Valley had to offer was "around the corner" access to PCB (printed circuit board) fabrication and assembly houses, tech support of all major chip suppliers, and most important - a lot of customers.
