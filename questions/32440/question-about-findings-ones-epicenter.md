In the 37signals book rework they mention finding ones Epicenter, the one thing your business must have to survive. 

They use the example of a hot dog stand and the guy needing at least the hot dog to have a business even if he is lacking everything else that people "may" want.

Now my business is IT services I repair personal and business computers, setup networks, create webpages, and train and support staff.

So I feel like my epicenter would be to provide IT services.

However I feel this is too broad.

Any suggestions?

In this case, your epicenter is your skills and knowledge/experience.

To repair a computer, you must be able to diagnose a problem and fix it.
To build a network, you must understand networking.
To create a webpage, you must have some development/design skills.
To train and support staff, you need knowledge and experience.
