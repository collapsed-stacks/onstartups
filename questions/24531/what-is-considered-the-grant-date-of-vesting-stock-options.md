I have some options to buy stock in my startup, and they are vesting merrily.  When tax regulations discuss "two years after the grant date," is that the date we signed the contract, or the date each share vested?

Edit: the company and I reside in California, USA, but I believe it is a "Delaware corporation"

The grant date is the date you were issued the share option.  Normally you will have a share option certificate, which will have the grant date and exercise price on it.
