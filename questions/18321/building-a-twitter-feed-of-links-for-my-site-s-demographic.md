I'd like to build an RSS feed for my website's twitter.  It would be a feed of links that interest my user demographic-- college students.. the links would be funny, informative, interesting, etc.  Just something that'd make my demographic want to follow.  I'd want to avoid anything NSFW, so I probably want to avoid far-out humor sites like collegehumor unless they're linked from a work-safe blog.

I already understand the technical side of building a feed, I was just wondering how I can compile a list of sources for the feed.. if it was based on some kind of solid marketing research (e.g. college students are known to follow so-and-so top 10 sites more than any others) that'd be great.

I'd really like to avoid paying for any marketing-research services as we're on a tight budget.. SO free would be the way to go!

One of the ways would be to find out the influential twitter users that tweet information abut college students. You can check,

http://wefollow.com/twitter/student

Then write a twitter bot to aggregate and filter the tweets from the users you find appropriate for your demographic.

to be honest it sounds like a waste of time.  Twitter is fad, overrated, and a piss poor solution to marketing.  99% of business that are on twitter have no idea why they are.  It doesnt produce results.  The majority of what goes on twitter is done by robots.  Very few people actually read tweets, and if they do they are missing a few brain cells.

Dont get me wrong, twitter has a small purpose to effectively publish links to your new articles, or share promotions.  But the reality is that most of the content you publish or post to twitter seldom gets realized.  

Unless if you are a celebrity with a million followers, then twitter is greatly overrated.
I dont want to sound pessimistic, but try doing some research into twitter conversions.

I would try Twitter and Facebook. You can create a Facebook Ad and target students... Facebook Ads are very cheap - for now.

@Frank It is OK to have an opinion but not trash a great marketing tool like Twitter just because you either don't like it or don't understand it. Twitter, just like any other tool works very well as long as you know how to use it.

<p>How about creating a Twitter list from people that you found with <a href="http://bit.ly/i58SEt" rel="nofollow">WeFollow</a> and then generating an RSS feed from that list?</p>
