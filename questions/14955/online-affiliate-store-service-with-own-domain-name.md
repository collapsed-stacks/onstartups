I am looking for an online affiliate store service in the like of **Amazon astore**, but which lets me use my own domain name.

Does anyone know of such service?

<p>A few more scripts you may want to try include:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.affiliatenichescript.com/" rel="nofollow">Affiliate Niche Script</a> - A scipt allowing you to build an affiliate store combining both the Amazon Associates and eBay Partner Network programs.  This option is not terribly expensive (unlimited license for $97), and is designed well out-of-the-box.  If you have a bit of web design knowledge, you will end up with an amazing looking website.  The feeds for this script allow you to also mine ratings and reviews from Amazon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freshstorebuilder.com/" rel="nofollow">Fresh Store Builder</a> - This script is a bit more expensive ($297 for 3 licenses, $29 per license after initial purchase), however it is much more versatile than Affiliate Niche Script when it comes to design and customization options.  From a usability/admin perspective, this script is phenomenal.  Also, checkout for Amazon US affiliates is integrated - making it likely that conversions will be better.</p>

<p>Found some answer to my own question:</p>

<p><a href="http://associate-o-matic.com" rel="nofollow">associate-o-matic.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://theeasystore.com" rel="nofollow">theeasystore.com</a></p>

<p>associate-o-matic.com seem to have a better seo, based on a quick check of their demo sites/users sites.</p>

<p>Does any have experience with those?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freshstorebuilder.com/" rel="nofollow">Fresh Store Builder</a> is now $97 - well, thats the 1 license package or you can get 10 for $197 and so on. Looks like the best option to me from the demos and feedback online</p>
