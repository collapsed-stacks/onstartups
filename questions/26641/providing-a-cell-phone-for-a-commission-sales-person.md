I want to provide a cell phone for a contracted sales person for a couple of reasons. The biggest one being if they stop communicating with people he is workng with for my company, I want to retain that phone number when he is no longer doing sales for me. What I am asking is if I provide a phone for him does that make him an employee and not an independent contractor?

If you are concerned about this why not use a virtual number that is forwarded to his cell.  He can also expense his business calls/cell times to your company.
