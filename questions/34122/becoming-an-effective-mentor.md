At 39, I am not a young entrant into entrepreneurship.  The majority of my career has been spent as an engineer in a subordinate position.  I have only light undergraduate business training as a CIS graduate sparse experience running my own business.  A few years ago I made the leap and began designing what is today a promising pre-launch start-up.  I've managed to get accepted into the Start-up Chile incubator, which leads to my question.

One of the responsibilities of the program is to mentor young entrepreneurs.  Truth be told, I am a more likely candidate for mentee than mentor, but as with most things I've accomplished, I plan on flying by the seat and navigating as I go.  What I want to avoid is becoming the guy who spews empty platitudes and provide something of value to the best of my capacity.

My question is this:

How would you best define the role of mentor?  If you've been a mentor, how would you counsel others to enable and inspire others?  If you've had a great mentor, what's a great piece of advice you received?  Can anyone recommend some resources on BEING a mentor, not finding one?

Apologies.  That was 4 questions.

A mentor is simply a more experienced person who will act as a coach in particular subject matter.

I suspect that you have far more to give as a mentor than you realize. Just because you mentor a younger entrepreneur does not mean that you have to know everything about everything in order to help him. Because you are older than most startup people, you probably know a lot of things that are useful that they have not yet learned.

Here is an example. One recurring problem I see with the current crop of startup founders is lack of wisdom and experience in very practical operational business basics. I mean, as specific subject areas, the following: 

- the fundamentals of negotiation and evaluating contract language
- good business communication practices (the younger set is notoriously bad at this, having grown up with crappy IM-speak and fragmented sentence structure)
- business management skills and tactics
- technical management skills and tactics

So, I say, don't worry a bit about this aspect. You will probably find ways to help effectively. 

As far as guidelines and best practices go - here are some issues I have run into with mentors and mentoring myself.

Commonly, a lot of mentors will make their advice all about themselves. Mentors who ego trip (which cuts into their effectiveness) are quite common. So try to put your ego on the shelf and understand what the person actually needs. 

Don't expect miracles. You seem to be setting a very high bar for performance. Just be responsible and only instruct in what you know. And don't even expect the person to take action on your advice. Possibly they are not ready for it. 

Relax and enjoy the experience. Perhaps as a mentor in a particular situation your main role is simply to encourage and to point out areas of risk and opportunity. That's good enough to be considered an effective mentor.

My 2 cents:

For me  being a  mentor means showing people what to do and expecting results. Sometimes that's enough as all people need (myself included) is an eye over their shoulder. Stay out of the detail. Help them work on themselves as well as helping them find their own solutions to problems they come up with. (I sometimes go to great lengths to make sure that the person I'm helping comes up with the solution rather than me give it to them).

A mentor is not a life coach, although they can be one.  In my book - a mentor tells you what to do, and a life coach will help you when you get stuck mentally. (As any "I can't do it" excuse is just a self limiting belief.. not something a great mentor "cares" about.. although they do care).

In my experience you inspire others by holding themselves accountable to what they have decided, and asking tough questions from the vantage point of seeing the big picture when they're sometimes stuck in detail.

But at the end of the day, what makes a great mentor?  A great student.
