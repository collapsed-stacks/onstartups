I have found certain shareware software products have large number of downloads.  My question is if there are some 20,000 free downloads, how many of the downloaders would have actually bought and paid for this software?For Conversion sake consider a small Image Editing Tool with some 40$ price tag

It depends a lot on the software, but generally 5% is very good conversion for most shareware apps. 1% is more typical.

Your question will never have a concrete answer due to the fact that there is too many factors. to list a few:

 - Does the software offers a trial period (user is asked to purchase a
   license or the product in order to use the software)?
 - The software works after the user un-install and re-install the software
   ?
 - The software provide something that no other free software or cheap
   competitor have ?

Quite hard to answer your questions as it does not looks like a real question.

You must be joking - no, it does not. That woudl be a 50% conversion rate - you do not get that ever.

> how many of the downloaders would have actually bought and paid for this software?For 

NO IDEA. That depends on many factors, among others the TYPE of software, the features without paying etc.

Whatever it is, it will NOT be 50%. That would be totally awesome for a lot of companies but it is totally unrealistic - the real number is between 0 and some LOW percentage number.

LOL, a 50% download conversion rates means they must be downloading the digital version of crack cocaine for it to be that additive they're then paying!
