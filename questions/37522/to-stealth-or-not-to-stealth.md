I'm currently working on a startup in stealth mode.
Right now we have a pre-launch page with our tag ine. But I feel like I should redesign to give further explanation of what we are doing in order to get more users.

On the other hand we are getting subscribers without much info, and a redesign explaining the application opens us up to risks involving competition.

For those who've had experience in this, can you advise me on this situation?

Stealth mode is, in all but a tiny minority of cases, pointless.

If you don't talk to your users, how will you understand their needs, and whether they are prepared to use (and pay for) your solution?

If your idea is so easy to copy, it will be copied within hours or launching.
If you had the idea, other people have probably had the idea.
Even if your idea is "stolen", your vision and execution cannot be.

Those that might want to find out a little about what you are doing only need to subscribe to your mailing list and wait till you start opening up about what you are doing.

Some will give their email addy out of plain curiosity, not interest or intention to steal, simply because you are not telling them anything yet so they subscribe.

Many people change their mind anyway, people can be fickle, someone could try copying your idea and lose interest a few weeks later as something shiny catches their eye.

Think about it this way, the type of people that go looking for an idea to copy may also be the type that dont focus long and hard enough on anything to be of any concern to you.
