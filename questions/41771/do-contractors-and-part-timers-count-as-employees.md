When asked in person, or in an survey, the number of employees a startup has, should one count contractors in that number? What about part-timers or interns?

Many companies or organizations use the term FTE or Full time Equivalent. If two people split the 40 hours a week, they would make one FTE. I would specify the interns as another category.
It would be acceptable either say we have 4 Full-time and 6 part-time employees; or we have 8 FTEs. 


The contractors should be noted separately, though they can also be stated by FTE.

For the purposes of an unofficial survey I would go with the FTE # for he actual employees, and give 1/2 credit for the interns. I would ignore the contractors in the count.

If the survey wanted to know how many people worked in the office space, and didn't care how they were paid, I would add the contractors to the count. The landlord might want to estimate the number of parking spaces you will need.
