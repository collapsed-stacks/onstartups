<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p>"<em>A trademark, trade mark, or trade-mark is a recognizable sign, design or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others.</em>"</p>

<p>So a WORD itself can't be "trademarked"...</p>

<p><a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&amp;p_lang=english&amp;p_d=trmk" rel="nofollow"><strong>Here</strong></a> <strong>you can search the registrated trademarks</strong>. </p>

<p>--> select: "Basic Word Mark Search (New User)"<br>
 --> then select the option "Live", write the searched word (here: "airbag") and press the search button</p>

<p>Do a search on trademarkia.com - you can find marks, their class and status there.</p>

<p>For example a search on <a href="http://www.trademarkia.com/trademarks-search.aspx?tn=airbag" rel="nofollow">airbag</a> brings back 30+ results.  </p>

<p>If you want do do a search on patents, google has a patent specific site @ <a href="https://www.google.com/patents" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/patents</a> </p>
