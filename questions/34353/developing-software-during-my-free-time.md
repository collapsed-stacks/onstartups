I work in Qatar as an IT administrator. I have developed a piece of software for my company in my free time. Developing software isn't part of my duties. If the company asks for the program's source code, what should I do? Is there any law that allows me to deny their request and keep the code?

<p>It depends on Qatar laws on employees' inventions. I googled around and here's the take of a <a href="http://www.iclg.co.uk/index.php?area=4&amp;country_results=1&amp;kh_publications_id=156&amp;chapters_id=3867">reliable source</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the ownership of the patent shall be assigned to the employer, if the
  invention was a result of execution of a contract or a commitment for
  exertion of inventive faculty, or <strong>if the employer proves that the
  worker has only achieved that invention through utilisation of
  facilities, aids or data available through his employment</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if you actually developed the software in your free time, and without the facilities of the company (actually, without <strong>evidence</strong> that you used company's facilities or data), all the rights are yours. In any case, keep in mind that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The assignment of ownership to the employer in this case shall not
  prejudice the employee's right to receive <strong>special remuneration</strong> to
  estimate in the light of the circumstances of the contract or the
  obligation, and the economic significance of the invention.  Any
  agreement depriving an employee from such right of remuneration shall
  be considered null and void.  A patent application filed by an
  employee inventor within the two years following the termination of
  his services shall be regarded as having been filed during his
  employment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope this helps, have a chat with a local lawyer if they claim anything.</p>

There is a very high probability that if requested, you will be required to provide the source code. Generally speaking, unless you are a subcontractor any work performed by you (for the company) during your employment term is considered property of said company. As David noted, you'll want to review the contract.

Do most companies really care? I'd say that the vast majority of them couldn't care less what you do in your spare time as long as it doesn't intefere with your work. Also, you state that programming is not one of your duties, so I'd say just carry on and forget about talking to a lawyer. You also say that the app is for use in your company so do you expect to sell it elsewhere. If not then I don't see a problem here at all.

If you are really worried about it then talk to your supervisor. Most of these situations can be resolved very quickly by having a quick chat with someone in a more senior position than yourself.

Good luck and congratulations on developing your app.

For me you are not obliged to give out the source code of your projects. You have all the right to retained it. 

You were not obliged to provide the source code. The best thing to do is to speak to your immediate supervisor or the person who is higher in position to you and discuss the situation to him/her.

The source code is your own masterpiece and should always be at your control. The question is that only if??? How about if not???

NO you shouldn't give it to them if you don't want. Its not a part of your job to code, you create a code in your spare time t help the company. If the company wants the source they should give you compensation for it. Its the same way as you using a personal car to go to a conference for your job, you wouldn't give your car to the company would you? That said, how much do you like your job? Because the likely thing is if you don't give them the source, you may get fired. So its a choice to make
