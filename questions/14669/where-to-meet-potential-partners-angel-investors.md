I've been running a nice dating site for the last 4 months and it's growing quite well and hope to be in alexa top 100k by end of year. So far it's only me doing pretty much everything, but I want to take things to the next level, mostly I want to find a partner who would put in time in exchange for equity. My personal network is pretty small and it's hard to find somebody who was the drive and commitment that I would like.

Are there startup partner matchmaking sites that I possibly could utilize ?

Attend startups events, conferences, and perhaps consider applying to a startup accelerator/incubator. There is a list of startup incubators here:
