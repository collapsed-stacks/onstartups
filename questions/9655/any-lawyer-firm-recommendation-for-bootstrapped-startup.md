I have created a website with no investors and won't be making any money off the site any time soon. How ever I want to protect my home and other assets before launching & need help with forming terms and conditions/privacy. I am the only founder. My website doesn't charge the user for anything but that could change in future.

My guess is initial setup (llc) , terms & conditions will be mostly boiler plate (with some customizations ofcouse). However the terms will change as the website evolves and I am looking for a lawyer that i can go back to and make changes as needed.

Can someone recommend good lawyers/firms which wont cost me an arm and a leg?


thanks,

Check out Perry, Krumsiek & Jack, LLP - I am a partner in this firm and I am part of a group in the firm that provides counsel to startups at well-below market rates to build this practice area. We are currently setting up a service to provide "in-house" counsel on demand. www.pkjlaw.com

WSGR, Wilson Sonsini, Goodrich and Rosati, is the most well known tech law firm in the Bay Area. I believe they are in Palo Alto. There are many good firms and the key is to find a compatible attorney for your startup, some also have a group that focuses on startups. Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, WSGR, Fenwick and West and Bullivant Houser Bailey also have a startup focus. I met a couple of the attorneys from Bullivant at the SFNewtech meetup 2 weeks back and they seem knowledgeable. But you should call around and some of them will defer fees if they buy into your idea.
