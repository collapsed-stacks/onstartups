If I want to make a site that will have a simple game (multiplayer online) based on an anime will I need a trademark? Or even some agreement from the anime creator or any other kind of permission?

If you plan to make money with that site, I think it would be best to either invent your own anime character, or attempt getting a licensing deal from the company that owns it. Otherwise you could end up with a cease & desist in your inbox one day, or worse, sued.

A trademark is not what you need in your case, to answer your question.
