## Is Revenue Management a good pricing strategy for services?

How practical is it to apply revenue management strategies (the pricing method of almost all airlines) for pricing services (like printing)?

To be more specific take the following example:
At a university with 30k students, there are 80 printing devices the are operated by the university itself or a service company. Usually, you have fixed prices for copying, printer depending on the page size, colors... 

However, at specific times of the year (or month, or day) you get a lot of sales (start and end of the semester, etc.). Would it make sense to make the price dynamic to adjust to the demand, such that the revenue and the service costs (in this case refilling paper, toners, maintaince), would be lower?

I know that many people are already complaining about the uncertainty of airline tickets prices, so I am not sure whether it makes sense to apply this model elsewhere.

Increasing prices around report time sounds like a recipe for getting all the printers damaged by outraged students.  

One could make the point that higher demand requires higher service - but varying the prices too much would strike me as being opportunistic.  

Perhaps evaluating pricing, setting a reasonable rate and offering a "discount" on off-season / low volume times would smooth out demand.
