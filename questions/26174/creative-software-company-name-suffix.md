A lot of technology companies, especially non-consumer facing, have a multi-part name.  The first part can be almost anything...  The last word, or suffix, is a more formulaic noun, common choices being:

* Technology
* Networks
* Solutions
* Software
* Development
* Associates

So you might have "Blue Sky Software", or "Kiwi Solutions" or "Purple Panda Technology".  I'm ignoring the legal incorporation suffix here.

This last part of the name describes what a company is or does, but I think it can be made to do more with just a little creativity.  Can anyone show me a list of words that could be used in this context?  I'm especially interested in any creative ideas relevant to modern tech companies.

Edit:

To exemplify, here is a name I discovered today:   http://www.armadillobitworks.com/  "Bitworks" says what they do - implies stuff works, low-level bits, a work ethic.  I'm hoping someone has thought of more like this or has a list.

I really like 'labs' for this, a great example would be: http://www.vigetlabs.com

I hope this is what you're looking for.

Guess it doesn't need to be having any suffixes. EX: Apple, Google, Oracle, SAP, Peoplesoft, JDEdwards, Accenture, CapGemini, etc have names w/o any of these suffixes. It reflects the founders ability to decide on a simple sounding name. thanks

'Computing' and 'Systems' are two other common/good suffixes.
