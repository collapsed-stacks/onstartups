Anyone know of an ONLINE solution for managing contracts, legal forms, etc?  Something where I could generate, send, sign, and store legal contracts online- so that both parties would never need to print anything out?

Thinking kind of like a LegalZoom combined with a database.

<p>I like <a href="http://echosign.com" rel="nofollow">EchoSign</a>. It has some basic, basic templates but its main claim to fame is that is manages all your documents and signatures electronically.</p>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://groupdocs.com/" rel="nofollow">GroupDocs</a> to get your legal forms, contracts or any type of <a href="http://groupdocs.com/apps/signature" rel="nofollow">documents signed digitally</a>, store them in the cloud or share with anyone, you want. You can also view all documents online; annotate, compare and assemble them too.</p>

<p>Hope the below screenshot will elaborate further.</p>
