The new version of my business website is about to release in coming weeks which mainly includes UI improvement and support for some advance features. Within that time period, I donâ€™t want to contact bloggers, reviewers or participating in other social and community engagement activities until the improved website version goes public. 

So in the meanwhile, what internet marketing and promotional techniques we can follow to keep the visitors traffic flowing?

I have basic plan ready for it but want to seek opinions from other SEO and internet marketing geeks to compare it with my plan and making sure that I have not missed any promotional techniques.

SEO is a big topic on its own and something that should be done on ongoing basis, regardless of what phase your business/product is in. Seeing results take time, so you can't really plan on getting SEO changes out in time for when you need/want traffic. 

Run your site through SEO tools listed in this post and follow recommendations:

On the marketing side, you have acquisition and retention type campaigns to consider and it sounds like you are focusing on getting new users to your site at the moment.
 
For getting new users/subscribers to the site use SEM and figure out your best performing keywords and ad variations. It will be helpful for you to see if users from SEM campaigns convert better after your UI and feature improvements are live.

Prepare some "win back" email campaigns listing all the improvements you have made for users who haven't come back to your site in a while after registering and those who have cancelled subscriptions in the past.

This is not all you could do, but SEM and email marketing are more targeted ways to reach your customers without increasing general awareness for your product in any unpredictable way.
