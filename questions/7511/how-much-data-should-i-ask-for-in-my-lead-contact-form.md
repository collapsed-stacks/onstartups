We have a contact form on each page of our marketing site.  We ask for a name, phone and email.  We made it simple b/c our goal was to get as many people/companies to submit their information.  

Within the last 3 years, I find that 9 out of 10 leads are window shoppers, which is fine.  It's like trying to sell a car to someone who's thinking about getting their driver's license.  That initial sales call can also be awkward b/c I'm trying to learn the person's specific needs.  

I would like to be better prepared on the initial sales call.  Should we require more information on our contact form to better qualify these leads or will this backfire and stop legitimate customers from submitting their information?

Here's what I would do, assuming these are business customers:

- I would ask also for the name of their company.  You can Google them and search in LinkedIn before you call them.

- If my competition has these forms, then look at what info they require.  Do not request more info than that, visitors will just leave your page.

- Fine tune the initial contact process.  Ask the key questions first.  "What do you do at X company?" and "what do you use currently to solve this problem" (this is an example, you do not post what your product is).  These questions can get you a ton of info and you can know right away if you are talking to the guy who signs the check or someone who cannot buy.  Of course, if the guy cannot buy, ask them who you should call, and now you are better prepared to call the guy who can really make a decision.

At the end of the day, if they leave their info, they are at least somewhat interested, but you cannot burden the visitor with a lot of questions otherwise they will just leave.

My answer sucks because it's kind of open ended. It'd be cool to have more info about all of this.  It might be, for example, that you think the people are window shoppers because your price seems too high for them, or it does not solve the problem they have.  People don't leave contact info just for fun or to waste time.  It seems there is a need in there somewhere.

In thinking about what I do when I search for products a few things come to mind.

  - If the vendor tells me why they want to know something I'm more likely to answer the question.  "So we can have the right person contact you what state are you in?" gets me to answer more than "give us your address" even though they are probably used for the same purpose.
  - Questions that let me specify my interest and guide me about what the product does are more interesting.  "what is the problem you're trying to solve" especially if there are choices I relate to select from would get an answer from me.

If it's the right questions I'm more likely to answer them and feel good about having someone contact me.  Besides if they are optional I can always skip them so having them there does not hurt.

As a bit of a marketer myself and someone who hates handing over my personal information, I'd suggest that the form is about right. You will get window shoppers, but it's your job to sift through them.

Why not set up a second form after they have signed up to ask them follow up questions? Alternatively offer newsletters/updates?

Personally though, nothing beats phoning someone shortly after they express an interest. It's time consuming, but if the sale is worth it, then it's just part of the job.

The last thing you want to do is not get someone's phone number just because you want to make your life a little bit easier.

The Linkedin suggestion is also good (and also means you can go in armed knowing a little more about the person when you speak to them).

Make the form as short as possible. People hate filling out forms.
Personally I don't like forms asking me for my phone #. The ones that make it a required field, I just put something like 999999999. I HATE cold calls. Send me an email. If you add my email address, make sure you have an unsubscribe link. Spamming me without me able to opt out is not good.
