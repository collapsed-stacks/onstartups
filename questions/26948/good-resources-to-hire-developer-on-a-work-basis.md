Is there a place where I could hire a developer (or a team) based on functional specs I would submit.  What I am envisioning is a site where I would submit a description of my project and get access to a selection of developers interested in my project.  I would then select them based on reviews (and cost to some extent).

Rather than running a blind Google search, I'm looking for curated responses.

Thanks,

JDelage

I've been using Odesk for a while now and got excellent bids (then work done) for all sorts of tasks. WVorker and ELance are good too though more intricate to use
