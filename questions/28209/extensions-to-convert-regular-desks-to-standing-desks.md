Is there a desktop add-on that would allow a normal desk to become a stand up desk? It has to be purchasable and quick to assemble (no cutting or drilling). 

Basically we have a bunch of desks that cannot be replaced (built into the cubicle walls) so we need "vertical extensions" if you will that would allow a user to convert to standing.

<p>Depending on the existing height of the desk, I suspect a <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001SRX67S" rel="nofollow">variety of</a> <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002JF8PS8" rel="nofollow">laptop stands</a> would work for raising a laptop + mouse to standing height, though you may need an additional platform per desk for the mouse. </p>

<p>Desktop machines with a separate monitor and keyboard make things harder, but honestly I would just use a laptop stand for the keyboard + mouse, and go low-tech for the monitor: buy a bunch of cheap, thick books, stack 'em together, and set the monitor on top. Apply duct tape as needed for stability. </p>

<p>(Your question is definitely relevant to startups if the answer involves duct tape.)</p>
