I recently moved from Michigan to Texas.

I did some research and i decided it maybe easier to end my LLC in Michigan and reform one in Texas where i currently reside. The laws are more conducive for businesses in the State of Texas.

What is the process of ending an LLC ?

Every state is a little different. You researched this, so you're the best person to answer this question.

Generally, you just need to file some paperwork with the state to disolve your business in that state. You may also need to pay taxes at the end of the year for the time your business was active in Michigan.
