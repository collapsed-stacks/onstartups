Around 1 month back I had received legal notice from court for stealing information from my competitor to setup my business that I did around 2 years back. I had a couple of email conversations with my competitor that time before I setup mine, and that email has become the basis of this lawsuit which I can not deny and now they are looking to get me out and win it. I had a couple of appearances and already losing the case. I have already given up but just in case there is something, please let me know what options I have.

Please excuse if I have not shared full information above about business, etc.

Your options are

 1. Settle the case with the plaintiff out of court and have the lawsuit dismissed (having a lawyer would be helpful).
 2. Hire a lawyer and try to win the lawsuit (hopefully not too late).
 3. Fight the lawsuit on your own and most likely lose.

For your sake, I hope you have a company and are not personally liable.

I would also recommend you to get legal help but not sure how much it would help you in this case. Also, if you lose it, start afresh with new idea and don't try to steal existing business information.
