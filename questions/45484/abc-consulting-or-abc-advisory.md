for a firm in the business industry, specifically in strategic management, finance, HR, is there a more suitable word between consulting and advisory?

I mean, does "ABC Consulting" have a difference from "ABC Advisory" ? If yes, which one is more preferrable and what should I do if the "ABC Consulting" is taken as a name ?

Thank you

Consultants typically are engaged to fill a specific need / fix a specific problem.  Advisors are better at discovering what the problem is - whether current or upcoming.  They help their clients capacity to solve their own problems. 

Example: 
How do I make more money?  Call an advisor.
How do I fix this CMS problem?  Call a consultant.

I would say 'consulting'. I have been a business strategy consultant for years and worked for and with numerous firms. The number who called them 'Advisory' is, like, zero. If you were focused on money management or some such, I think the term 'Advisory' or 'Advisors' is more common, but in a business setting, I can't recall seeing if very often, if ever.

On the other hand, if abcconsulting.com is taken and abcadvisors.com is available, that may make the decision for you - unless the .com is unused and can be purchased for reasonable money.

If you do go with the advisory angle, I would suggest 'Advisors' over 'Advisory'. ABC Advisors makes sense to me as a thing. ABC Advisory this doesn't really make sense to me - that isn't common English usage in my opinion.
