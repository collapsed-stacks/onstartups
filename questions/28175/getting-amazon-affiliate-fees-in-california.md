Amazon recently [announced][1] that it will cease paying affiliate reward to its California associates.  As a startup very reliant on affiliate fees, is there any way to get around this?

Background: We registered as an LLC outside of the state and just moved to Cali.

2nd question: Even if I am in California, would Amazon have any way of knowing if all my cards/addresses supplied to them are still back home?

<p>Amazon will not let you be an affiliate because you are a CA resident. Please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/07/06/re-incorporation-wont-save-amazon-affiliate-from-termination/" rel="nofollow">Re-incorporation Wonâ€™t Save Amazon Affiliate from Termination</a>.</p>

At the moment I think you are stuck. I believe that Amazon has cut off all business with its California affiliates because California is claiming that they constitute a business situs in the state. California says that Amazon must collect sales tax on sales within the state because Amazon has a situs in the state. Amazon is trying to get enough signatures to qualify a proposition for the November ballot that would prevent the state from collecting the tax.

I am a NC resident and face the same problem. It seems that Amazon ceased their Associate program in several states that are demanding state tax be collected. I also looked into using an agent to incorporate a business in another state but apparently that isn't a valid work around. It seems I am still not eligible for their program simply because I'm a resident of NC.
