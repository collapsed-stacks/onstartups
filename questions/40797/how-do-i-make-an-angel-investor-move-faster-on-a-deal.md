The investor is very excited but he seems very slow on the deal. We've been in communication for 3 weeks. I recently gave him access to the invesment package. But There was A tech issue on a website where I organize the package. So, he couldn't see the material. He will checking this week, I have no doubt. I would love to know tactics to make the deal move forward to close quick. Right now, My startup is burning a lot of capital. So, I need the capital.

In 3-4 days, after he's had a reasonable amount of time to review what you sent, you ask him what he would need to make the deal happen and **set a time perspective**. You might say something like:

*"We're looking to move forward with our business and for that we need your investment. Apart from what you already have and what we've already discussed, what else would you need to see to make the deal happen this week?"*

*"Are you ready to move forward and make that investment this week?"*

*"Are you able/in a postion to make the investment now?"*

*"Can we count on your investment this week?"*

If he draws up an objection, then it's even easier (as long as you can overcome it of course): *"If we do/provide/agree on X, are you ok to make the investment?" - "Yes" - "Ok, great, then I'll come by your office/house to pick up the check; when would it be most convenient for you?*

**Ask for the check! Most people just don't ask and keeping the conversation going in circle. ASK!!!! People don't want to invest in a CEO who can't close deals, but they'll never tell you that.**

Practice these sentences if you need to, repeat them 50 times in a row, adapt them to your style and **ASK. And most importantly, after you ask, you shut up: you let the silence be, and you let him give you the answer. Get comfortable with silence.**

Good luck.

PS: nothing ever gets closed via email. It's sometimes over the phone and most of the time in a face-to-face meeting.

Unless you have a competing investor or a time sensitive business opportunity, you have a better chance of making an iceberg melt than making an investor to move forward quicker than they want. 

That said: did you fedex him a printout of your online "package"? Did you ask if there were any due diligence items he requires to make a decision? Do you know what his investment timeframe is?  Is there anything else s/he is considering investing in? All would help paint a better picture on what timeframe s/he is operating under.
