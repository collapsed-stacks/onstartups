I'd be interested in your experience or examples of how "one-person-companies" refer to themselves: as "we" or "I".

Currently, my site copy uses "we/us" (e.g. "contact us"), but there's really only me at the moment.

Some people recommend using "I" saying that it makes for a more personal customer experience, but I have to say that it just does not sound that professional to me. 

What's your take on this?

Since your business is an entity, it is perfectly appropriate and common form to use 'contact us' regardless of how many employees the company currently has. There are a number of good (and obvious) reasons you'd want to do this. 

When/if asked about the company size by a concerned prospect or customer, it is of course necessary and ethical to say that you are currently the only employee of the company.

If you look at old business writing guidelines, companies always use the collective pronouns because by definition the word "company" means a groups of individuals united to perform a common task. 

Traditionally, what we today would call "one man shops" were not considered companies but rather "firms" usually named after the partners. For example, law firms would have names like "Dewey, Cheatem and Howe". In that case, each partner used the singular in referring to his own work and the collective when referring to a collective action taken by all the partners. Engineering firms, which are the closest thing to a one-man programming shop, used the same nomenclature.

However, "firms" tend to work with specific "clients" on discrete, individualized task. A one man software outfit, however, might do turnkey contract work like a lawyer or engineer or it might produce a mass market product more akin to a mass produced material product. People expect the singular pronoun in the former and the collective in the latter. 

I think it comes down to what type of work you do. If you do turnkey work, then you want to be a "firm" and use the singular unless you have partners working on the same contract. If you do mass release, then use the collective as if you were a manufacturing company. People expect a personal relationship in the former and an impersonal one in the latter.

<p>Mark,</p>

<p>First off, I would recommend reading Jason's article <strong><a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/youre-a-little-company-now-act-like-one.html" rel="nofollow">You're a little company, now act like one</a></strong> which has a useful perspective on this issue.  As Jason points out, <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/company" rel="nofollow">Balsamiq</a> is a great example of a small company being explicit about being a small company, and the smallness has actually enhanced their profile in the market.  (They're quite a few more people now, but for at least a year, it was a explicitly one-man band).</p>

<p>However, I don't agree that this is the end of the matter.  I am currently consulting for larger firms who have silly hang-ups about dealing with very small companies.  In this case, I believe it is okay to reflect your customers need for a little more scale, knowing full well that it's a kind of virtual reality.  (I am not proposing you mislead your customers, just that you don't feed their insecurities unnecessarily.)  </p>

<p>I don't completely agree with Jesper about working for big firms - I think it is possible to do profitable business with them - but <strong>it has to be on terms that work for you</strong>.  He's right, working with large firms carries a danger of wasting huge amounts of your time with stupid stuff - if you are not in a position to control this sort of thing, then steer well clear.  On the flip side, as a small firm getting a well-known customer onboard can add hugely to your credibility and make it easier to get other prospects engaged.</p>

<p>Speaking personally, I am cautious around the use of pronouns, both in spoken and written communication.  I think it depends a lot on the audience - I use 'we' when it isn't disingenuous to say 'we' but 'I' otherwise.  I agree with Keith and 'unknown's views that you don't want to have to re-write all your content when you add your first employee.</p>

<p>[Final caveat, if company == you (i.e., you a some sort of celebrity that the business is built around), then obviously 'I' all the way.]</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

When I began in business, I was concerned about "keeping up appearances" and projecting a professional image. I'm not suggestion you should be unprofessional, but over time, I have come to favor 100% honesty at all times, and not sweating the small stuff too much.

For a one-man business, I would say "I" and have my own name prominently displayed on the site.

First off, businesses don't create business, people do. Your customers are probably already remembering you as a person, and not by the company name.

Second off, one of the worst things that can happen to a small shop is getting a very large company as customer ***edit** with wrong expecations / on bad terms*. You don't want a huge company calling on you, and expecting you to take part in endless meetings and revisions, all that without getting timely payment because you don't have a clear decision maker inside the company who will sponsor your work. So go with a clear and honest image, that will also help your customers to recognize if its a mutually bad match, and may save you time and trouble.

One thing to note: While I think a first-person, owner's name on it tone is the right thing, be sure to not leave any doubt about which legal entity the business is with. Ensure that relevant business correspondence clearly identifies the company, with full company name, address and VAT number. If you leave reasonable doubt about who holds a contractual obligation, then you risk legal liabilities being being placed on you personally.

As someone on the hiring end, I generally prefer to work with individuals rather than companies if I'm after a service.  If the individual is a company, that's even more bonus because it shows there's some traction.

With a company, a "we", I'm never sure if the person I'm going to be working with is the same person who created the great design/copy/code that I've seen in the portfolio.

I prefer the direct engagement of the individual and the cost is almost always lower. 

Companies, however, are preferable when you need either a multi-disciplinary team or a degree of fail-safe redundancy.  If you've developed an online app, a "we" creates a needed extra sense of security.

I just asked this very question...I know that business ethics and "morality" are NOT the same thing, in my opinion. By their very nature are to different animals and often times, like light/darkness, they do not mix.

I've always been a one-woman website design house and would always market as such. However, I often use contractors and would convey who the "us" is to inform prospective clients that some work may be outsourced.

Now, on to my new passion in business,supporting attorneys in a very specialized field. Though, I'll be supporting attorneys, virtually and nationwide, I do have a business name and do not plan to have employees (I guess I'm half screwy). Part of my business name is the word "Assistant" to convey partnership even though I may have more than one attorney-clients. Therefor, I will be using terms such as, "I, "About The Company", "contact ME directly" [as apposed to voicemsg], etc.

I do see where the use of "we" when you are an 'I" is mostly contacted to you being a company. I've created a mrktg brand around my business name, because I wanted my business name to say what it is that I do...my personal name is irrelevant to my clients.

Which brings up a good point. Commercially, I am my business, and will register as a sole proprietor "me" doing business as "my company name". So, thanks for that tidbit.

If you intend to expand past one employee in the next year, say we.

If you intend to always be a one-person operation, say I.  If you're a professional, I is professional.

If you're a professional who's using a business name that doesn't have your real name in it, but you don't intend to expand, that's already half screwy.
