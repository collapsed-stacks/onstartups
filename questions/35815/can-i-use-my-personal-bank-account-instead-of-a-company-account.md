I've just registered a limited company in the UK. I wonder whether this is possible/legal to use your personal bank account until the company has its own account? I want to make online transactions on my website available as soon as possible, but it seems I won't be able to open an account for the company faster than within one or two weeks. The problem is my website operates in Poland, and it lasts a bit to prepare all documents required by Polish banks and translate the douments, whereas it's just about 10 minutes to open a personal account.

Can't speak for the UK but in the USA such co-mingling of funds makes it easier for someone suing your company to pierce the corporate veil and go after you personally.  I'd recommend going for a separate business only account.

Its legal in the UK. 

I agree with jmp though, its a bad idea. Using your own bank account raises suspicion of corruption and looks unprofessional. It will also make accounting a nightmare.
