Is there anyway to know the expiry date of a domain?

For example, I would like to buy the domain test.com. However, it is currently registered.

How do I find out when will it expire? I know that some people buy domains with automatic yearly renewal. But even so, there is an expiry date listed.

<p>The easiest way:</p>

<p><strong>By checking the public WHOIS database</strong></p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://www.internic.net/whois.html" rel="nofollow">whois service here</a> and enter your domain name. You can also use your domain registrar whois service to find out information.</p>

<p>Another <a href="http://who.is/whois/" rel="nofollow">whois look up</a> that could be useful.</p>
