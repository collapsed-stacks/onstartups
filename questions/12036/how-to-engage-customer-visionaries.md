What is the best way to get experts opinion on your ideas?  
The niche is relatively small. Enthusiastic experts are difficult to find. To get their time to review your ideas is even more difficult.


I an looking for something similar to what Peldi recommends for marketing: [STARTUP MARKETING ADVICE FROM BALSAMIQ STUDIO][1] but for Customer discovery stage.

Has anybody written an email template how to ask an expert for feedback? Especially writing to people you barely know or don't know at all?
Maybe there is something better than email?

Thanks,  
Alex

I'd suggest commenting on blogs, especially if the blog is of someone who is engaged.  But I suggest link to something that shows what it is that you'd be asking for.  Often there are bloggers who are the lead voice of consumers in established markets.

Luck

Maybe the niche is just too small to find enthusiasts/earlyvangelists within it, although often suggested to find those important early folk, they maybe dont exist in all niches.
