## What are the rules on prize draws on web sites?

I run a site like this for home theatre and music questions (see my profile if you're interested). To help increase my audience I'm planning on running a promotion whereby any user that meets a certain condition (for example has a question upvoted 10 times) is entered into a prize draw.

My concern is about the regulations around this kind of draw. In the UK lotteries are subject to very strict regulation whereas quizzes are more lightly controlled. I don't want to break any laws. So my question is in two parts:

1) My site is hosted in the US, but I run it from the UK. Which jurisdiction does it come under as far as lottery/prize draw regulations are concerned?

2) The criteria for entering the draw will be based on active participation in the site, which will demonstrate some degree of skill in as much as an answer/question has been phrased sufficiently well for peers to vote for it. Is this sufficient to class the draw as a quiz or would it be subject to lottery regulations?

I can post the second part separately if needed.

Unfortunately the real answer is "Ask a lawyer."

That said, I can tell you the laws in the USA are complex and vary by state.  I do know that you CANNOT make active participation the ONLY way to enter.

It really sucks that the regulations are so strict; why not allow these fun promotions?
