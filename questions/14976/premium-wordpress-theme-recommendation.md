I am looking for a premium Wordpress theme for a site about fashion.

I want it to look very good.

So far I have found this one which looks pretty good to me:

Does anyone have a recommendation?

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.woothemes.com/" rel="nofollow">WooThemes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://themeforest.net/category/wordpress" rel="nofollow">Theme Forest</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.studiopress.com/" rel="nofollow">Studio Press</a></li>

I'd agree on WooThemes - we're in the process of moving our site from a custom-build and hard-to-manage mini-CMS to Wordpress and one of WooTheme's themes and have been pretty happy with it.  Their code is clean and well documented, easy to customize to fit our needs, and looks great out of the box.

<p>Wordpress is better optimized by Framework and then theme.  In short a better more functional website to design and develop from. </p>

<p>Top (3) Frameworks:</p>

<p>1) Thesis
2) Genesis
3) Pagelines (Drag &amp; Drop)</p>

<p>You can see them all covered in more detail <a href="http://www.realtypress.us/category/real-estate-content-management-systems/wordpress-real-estate-content-management-system/premium-wordpress-real-estate-website-themes" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>They all have themes you can use and enhance the look of your website with but give you the biggest advantage in their "frameworks". </p>

I suggest to either go ahead with WooThemes or get a custom professional wordpress template for your fashion business.

If I were you I will contact a company and get unique custom designed wordpress template for my business.
