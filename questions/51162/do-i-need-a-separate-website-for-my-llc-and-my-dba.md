<p>I have noticed some companies have a separate website for their DBA and another website for their LLC. Under what circumstances or situation would I need to do this?</p>

<p>There are no legal reasons to have more than one site. What really matters is your customer-facing site: the place where your customers go and find out about your products.</p>

<p>Whether it makes you feel better about having a separate site that describes your corporation/LLC, it essentially doesn't matter. I can't think of a reason to have one.</p>
