What do you think - will a .com domain be more or less worth with the rise of the new domain extensions like .app and .shop?

I'm asking because I'm not sure if I should wait until next year to go with a .app address or if I should buy a .com domain name for my app now.

Any feedback welcome.
Thanks.

If you can buy a .com domain now do it.  There is no reason not to.  .com(s) are equally as likely to come up in searches as other domains as long as your website is optimized for search engines to find them.

But .com domain would be a good to have if not for anything but just for historic reasons.

.com usually are the best domains to be in first page in search engines like google in every country. Try to search about some products in google and see how many of these results are .com and how many are with others domains.
