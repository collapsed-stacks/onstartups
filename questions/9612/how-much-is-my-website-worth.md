I want to know, from a purely programmers/developers point of view, if you had to pay build this website, how much would you ask to do it? The site is http://www.marketdock.com

Some features:

    * Built on Drupal
    * Advanced Mailing Manager (send mass mail etc)
    * Stores and sends invoices plus keeps track of payments
    * Can connect to facebook and a variety of line networks to send messages
    * Send messages to "friends"
    * Site stats on profiles
    * Twitter connectivity
    * Cart solution (accept subscription payments)
    * Showcase products
    * Profile with: events, photos, blog entries etc

Hours spent on the site? I have no idea. A LOT. I spent the larger part of two months working on it, and I'd like to think of myself as a bit of Drupal expert. So yes, it was a lot of work.

So, in your professional opinion, what do you think is the value of the site? Or better yet, if you were a developer and you were asked to build this site, how much would you ask?

Are you asking for replacement cost, or are you asking to value it as a business?  I know little about Drupal and without going through the site, I would guess that if it is fully functional its replacement cost would be a few thousand dollars ($3K - $5K) at best.  It's probably worth more as a business, but you would want to have customers on the platform if you intended to sell it as such.

Just based on the information provided above and a brief scan of the site, this could probably be built for about $7500 CDN, give or take. A basic Drupal-based site can be built for $3,500 including shopping cart functionality and some customization of the themes. The additional features would be on top of that, probably about the same as the basic functionality.

Since you're asking, if you're looking for a quote, get in touch with me and I'd be happy to give you a more precise estimate.
