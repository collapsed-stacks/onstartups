This is more like a behavioral problem. I always want to start a business. Since this feeling increasing day by day, I am more obsessed in my day job(software Engineer). 

1.I have few startup ideas that are not innovative.<br/>
2.But i have the ability to start and consistently run the business.<br/>
3.I feel i am not fully utilized in my day job.I have changed companies and worked in different roles and still same feeling.<br/>
4.I have a mortgage and a loan to pay and it makes me obsessive with money.<br/>
5.All the time i am thinking about different startup ideas and business strategies and i am not able to concentrate on work.<br/>
6.Finally now i am 23 years old, decent reputation in office but i want to quit the job and start a business so i can work for me and grow it exponentially.<br/>
7.I have a asset that may help for investment in business but i am confused in which business i should get in.<br/>
8.I have a experience of running a partnership firm for last 5 years its no more into existence since all partners are in job.

now, finally.. I want to start a business and quit my day job. its running 24/7 in my mind. I am obsessed , angry all the time since i am not doing it. What is the solution for this !?

Have you spent any time thinking about the risks?  I think Eric Ries and all of the Lean Startup people are on to something.  Their focus is on the uncertainty of starting a venture such as you describe.  You can be fairly certain about the technology involved in getting an idea to market, but until you actually try it, you won't know about market acceptance.  Stay where you are, try a small thing that costs little and makes some money.  Try to change it in a way that costs little and makes more money.  Iterate and measure.  Repeat that process.
