I'm a design agency who does client-work through freelancers, and I'm looking to hire/partner with people in other states and work with them remotely to expand my reach to cross-country. Think 'franchising' my agency.

So what ways could I employ to reach the biggest number of potential partners? If it makes any difference, the more entrepreneur the freelancer the better, as in being able to actively prospect and sell, and manage other freelancers in the future, as well as designing itself.

Note that this question does not relate to the US or other country in particular, so in "venues" I'm really looking for types of places (e.g. universities, conferences, websites, magazines) I might advertise/look for my needs, not specific american venues.
