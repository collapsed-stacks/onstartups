## How to use the trademarked term "iPhone" in a Google Ad?

Let's say I developed a program for iPhone (which I sort of did) and want to advertise it through AdWords. Currently, Google lets you use the term "iPhone" in the keyword list, but doesn't allow using it in the ad body. The ad is pretty innocent:

>Sci calculator for iPhone
>
High precision scientific calculator
>
for iPhone. Free trial.

Google automatically warns me that I cannot use the term "iPhone" in the ad, because it is trademarked. Now, that's certainly wrong, because one can freely use a trademarked term when describing product compatibility. There is a checkbox saying I can send the ad for review by the Google staff, but whenever I click it, the ad eventually returns as "disapproved".

What are the ways around it? How to contact someone sane enough in Google to review the ad? I also heard that it's possible to obtain permission from Apple to use the term "iPhone" for ads (some restrictions would apply). Being a registered iPhone developer this might not be a problem. But then again, where do I submit the permission in Google?

There's a reason why, in fact, it's not wrong for Google:

You can use trademarks *in your own writing* for various things.  The liability is on you as to whether it's acceptable in trademark law.

Google is in the position of taking your copy and putting on their property, but then they're potentially liable.  Surely they cannot address all the international fair-use and trademark-specific terms of service for all these trademarks, so of course they just blanket refuse to include them.

**Note that even in your question you're not sure whether it's legal!**  You say it's OK to use it when talking about compatability, but you say Apple needs to license it for use in an ad.

Maybe you can fake it with "i Phone" or "i-Phone" or "eye-Phone."  Maybe you can go even softer with "mobile app" and hope people get it.  I admit these are weaker, but maybe it gets you going again?

Legally you can use the word iPhone in a "referential phrase" for an advertisement and not infringe on the trademark. For example you can say "App for iPhone" but cannot say "iPhone app". You infringe on the trademark when you confuse people as to the source.

Interesting that they would do this sort of thing. It's pretty easy to use a trademarked name since all you need to do is state who owns the trademark. For example, if I use iPhone, then I have to say it's a trademark of Apple.

I am sure the complication lies in that Google does not want to have to put all these disclaimers onto every single ad. So, maybe they are just lazy.

One thing to try, if allowed, is to put iPhone(TM) or something similar. That would show that it's a trademark and it should be legal but maybe not Google legal.

You can try and use the "appstore" as your reference. It's not as strong but it might be stronger than not doing it.

"Get it in the appstore"
