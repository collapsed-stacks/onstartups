There are many web developers that do full website work, but I wonder if there is any web developer that can code a prototype in the fastest time manner? Anyone offers such service?

Just goole it out... **This sounds as typical job for some freelancer**. 

So you can maybe try one of the websites for freelancing (freelance.com / freelancer.com / elance.com / ...)

Just ask if someone is ready to do that and you will see the offers. As far as I know, the freelancers are often more flexible (time, conditions,...) than bigger "web building companies" and are more willing to discuss and accept a task that is too small or too time tight for a classical company.
