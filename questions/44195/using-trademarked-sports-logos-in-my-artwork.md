Can I display original artwork in an exhibit if it contains trademarked logos, colors, fonts? An example would be an original oil painting I have of two NFL players wearing trademarked team uniforms, colors and logos on helmets. The piece will NOT be for sale, rather just on display in an exhibit. Am I infringing on any trademark laws by doing this? If so, what can I do to get to a point of being able to legally put my artwork in a show?

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL" rel="nofollow">IANAL</a> - but the NFL is pretty strict with their interpretation of fair use.  <a href="http://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/do-i-have-to-be-licensed-to-paint-an-nfl-player-in-799567.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-i-paint-an-nfl-logo-on-a-friends-private-swimm-269918.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> are relevant threads where lawyers discuss this issue.  </p>

<p>While you may not be selling the painting, if the exhibit charges admission there is the outside possibility that some "commerce" exists.  </p>

If someone else has intellectual property rights in something...don't use it without the person's consent.
