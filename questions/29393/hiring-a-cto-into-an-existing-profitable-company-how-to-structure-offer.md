I'm the CEO of a B2B startup. Been around almost 1 year and we already have a decent piece of software, 2 clients and are profitable. Not hugely so, but enough to pay the bills.

To scale to the next level I need a CTO. Have a good guy I know and am working out what to offer.

Thoughts:

 - Salary: Could possibly pay up to $2k / month (initially 3 days a week). More as we gain clients.
 - Equity: No idea here. Product idea was mine and I have grown the company by myself, but need a business partner. 5/10/15/20/25% more? I guess considering the low salary, more equity will be necessary
 - Anything else I can / should offer?

Cheers
