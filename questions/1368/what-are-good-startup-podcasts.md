What are the best podcasts for startups? Not only covering technology, but also legal issues, finance issues etc?

I love listening to podcasts, I can walk or run at the same time as learning something :-)

<p><a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/" rel="nofollow">This Week in Startups</a> by Jason Calacanis is very good. Most of the guests are successful entrepreneurs and sharing great info. If you just want to listen, there is also iTunes audio only version</p>

<p>In addition to the already mentioned <a href="http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Startup Success Podcast</a> and <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/" rel="nofollow">This Week in Startups</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://mixergy.com/" rel="nofollow">Mixergy</a> does weekly interviews with prominent entrepreneurs. Good quality, great content.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.toiletpaperentrepreneur.com/video/index.php" rel="nofollow">Toilet Paper Entrepreneur</a> also posts great video tips, but does so quite irregularly.</p>

<p>Don't know if this qualifies or not, but I enjoy the weekly <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/category/podcasts/" rel="nofollow">StackOverflow Podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Joel &amp; Jeff basically just talk about the design decisions, implementation, and problems the encounter while building StackOverflow.com.</p>

<p>It seems unfocused and has a 'water cooler chat' feel to it, but I learn something everytime I listen to it.</p>

<p>I like listening to <a href="http://helpmybusiness.com/" rel="nofollow">"Help, my business sucks!"</a>.  It's usually entertaining.  Andrew definitely tries to drive traffic to some of his paid content, but you do get some nice tips and thoughts from the podcast as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/" rel="nofollow">Manager-Tools</a> also has some good content on general management issues.  And, whether you are a start up or part of a large corporation, it can never hurt to brush up on your management skills.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of great audio books out there.  I know they aren't free like most podcasts, but you could check out Jim Collins' <em>Good to Great</em> and <em>How the Mighty Fall</em>.  They are easy to listen to and provide some great information.</p>

The Stanford Series that Hendro mentioned has a lot of great options: http://www.stanford.edu/group/edcorner/uploads/podcast/EducatorsCorner.xml - the recent one with Mark Pincus is a must listen.

This podcast from Duke's Entreprenurship 101 series with Aaron Patzer - the founder of Mint - is also a must listen: http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/new.duke.edu.1738990054?i=1422259961

Mixergy, as mentioned before, aslo has a bunch of good interviews.

<p>I am really surprised IT-Conversations has not been listed. They have the probably best list of interesting podcasts.</p>

<p><a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/series/innovators.html" rel="nofollow">Interviews With Innovators</a> by Jon Udell and <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/series/technometria.html" rel="nofollow">Technometria</a> with Phil Windley is a must listen.</p>

<p>They where the ones who spotted companies like Evernote and Etherpad way before anyone else.</p>

I am listening to a Podcast called Advanced Sales, sourced on ITunes.  Really good stuff, very actionable for software companies though not aimed squarely at the tech startup scene.

<p>I actually like the <a href="http://twit.tv/twig" rel="nofollow">This Week in Google</a> podcast, although it isn't necessarily about startups, it's about Google and other cloud based happenings, so it's in the area where a lot of startups work in. Also good to know what the 800 pound gorilla of the space is doing.</p>

<p>My Startup related podcasts come and go, but I really like <a href="http://www.evernote.com" rel="nofollow">Evernote</a>'s podcast, it tends to be very product related, but their CEO, COO and VP Marketing are the hosts and you get a lot of raltionale and candid discussions about how they are building their business.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com" rel="nofollow">37signals.com</a> podcast is interesting, I love how they are approaching their business.</p>

<p>Mixergy is my favorite too, I also recommend the already mentioned Entrepreneurs Thought Leaders series, Startups for the Rest of Us and Startup Success podcasts. 
A few more good ones that haven't been mentioned:</p>

<li><a href="http://5by5.tv/founderstalk" rel="nofollow">Founders Talk</a> </li>
