I have been very much interested in starting up a tech business in Minnesota, however relocating to, say, California really isn't an option at this point in my life. Are there any companies in Minnesota that I could get a hold of to discuss this tech startup?

<p>The <a href="http://www.mnan.org/" rel="nofollow">Minnesota Angel Investor Network</a> is a good place to start. There are other investor groups who are geographically flexible. Google is your friend.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the recently reported near-death of the Minnesota Angel
  community (as seen in the local Twin Cities newspapers) I am here to
  report that angel investors are alive and well in our state. They are
  just a little more cautious...</p>
