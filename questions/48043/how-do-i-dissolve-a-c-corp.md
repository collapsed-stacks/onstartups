I haven't used my C Corp, paid any taxes, or done the minutes. I haven't made a dollar or used the corp in any form. It was just a mistake opening the C Corp. I'm scared I have to pay the taxes from previous years even though I don't use it. I don't know the process of closing a C Corp that I never used.

There are some differences from state to state. The Secretary of State website for the state of incorporation probably has forms and instructions. Generally:

 - The board of directors and the shareholders approve dissolution.
 - All debts and liabilities are taken care of.
 - Dissolution documents are signed and filed with the state.
