I am developing an online marketing campaign for a local start up in Long Island, New York. I would like to find websites and blogs that are predominately visited by the Long Island community.

Is there a resource online that will allow me to find these particular sites?

Thanks in advance for the help!

<p>Adwords does support <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;topic=23083&amp;guide=22804&amp;page=guide.cs" rel="nofollow">targeting</a> </p>

<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.ppchero.com/geotargeting-basics-a-howto-guide-on-setting-up-geotargeting-in-google-yahoo-and-msn/" rel="nofollow">more detailed way</a> of describing the regions in google and yahoo. </p>

<p>I do believe a number of the ad networks also support regional targeting as well.  </p>

<p>For private placements, the top long island focused sites are pretty easy to find (newsday.com, longisland.com, libn.com, longislandpress.com) each can provide specific rate cards with traffic stats. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

There are hardly any free resources to do that. However, whatever blogs and sites come up after googling for "Long Island <something>" is your best bet. You can try different <something>, like news, blog, sale, stuff, etc.

I believe Google Adwords lets you target a specific location.

Try http://www.alexa.com/ I'm pretty sure you can check site by demographics.
