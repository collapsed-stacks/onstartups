Can I signup for a merchant/seller account of either Paypal, Google Checkout , Amazon Checkout using my credit card info and receive payments for the products sold online ? Would my credit card information suffice as far as setting up a merchant account for Paypal, google checkout goes? Is it legal to do so ? If not what is the legal or the correct way to do so? . 
Thanks in anticipation of the help :)

<p>Your major legal issue is that while you can own a business, on a student visa you cannot work for it.</p>

<p>If you ignore that legal impediment, before you can set up a merchant account, you will need to (a) obtain an Employer Identification Number and (b) open a bank account.</p>

I set up a merchant account on Paypal- I forget the exact requirements, but the fact that you're on a student visa is irrelevant.
