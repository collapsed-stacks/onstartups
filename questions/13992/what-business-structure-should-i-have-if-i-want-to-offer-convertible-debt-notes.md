I'm thinking about forming a single-member LLC (in the US), but I've never done convertible debt notes (bonds) before, so I don't know what impact that would have on my business structure. Is there any benefit or difference in doing an LLC versus something like a C-corp when it comes to issuing convertible notes?

I believe this is more a business question than a legal question.

From the legal perspective, there is not a huge difference between converting to shares of a corporation vs. converting to LLC units or membership interests.

The business difference is that many investors insist on investing in corporations rather than LLCs.
