Does anyone know if German startups (Gmbh) can offer employees a stock option plan?

As I understand, public companies in Germany can only offer options with a minimal vesting period of 4 years, which makes them irrelevant as incentives for startup employees (since there's a big chance that in 4 years the employee would miss the exit)

Is it similar for limited liability companies (Gmbh) or can they issue options with a smaller vesting period?

THey can not. A GMBH is not an AG - not aq stock company to start with. EVERY CHANGE in ownership requires a general assembly AND contracts in front of a notary.

GMBH's offeing stock options is in violation of german laws. If you and me sign a contract you sell me your GMBH - it is void because it was not done in front of a notary.
