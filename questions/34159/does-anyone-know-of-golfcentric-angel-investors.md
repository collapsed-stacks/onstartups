I have been working on finding an investor for the LTPGA - The Less Than Perfect Golfers Association, Inc. 

Finding a golf-centric angel who has a sense of humor would be ideal.

The basic math is sell 1 hat (just hats, not including bag tag, key chains, lapel pins or other merch I have in mind) to 1 out of 1000 golfers on the planet, it yields over $1 Million. I am really hoping to find an angel that loves golf and doesn't take themselves too seriously on the course so that this resonates heavily with them.

This is an "Everybody's Golf Club" affinity group that could help break the ice for golfers just meeting and help do away with the stratification based on score.

Does anyone know of a list to which I can look for such an angel to help get this off the ground?

I look forward to any help you can offer.

Sincerely,
W.D. Griever

Sorry, I do not have any angels in mind, but a piece of advice before pitching this to investors.. 

Don't base the business's success on the premise of, "if 1 in every 1,000 golfers buys a product it will generate x amount of revenue."

If that were the case, building a successful company would be the easiest thing on the planet, all we'd have to do is get 1 in every million people as customers ( easy right!?)

In reality, you're going to have a very difficult time getting 1 in 1,000 golfers to even remember your brand name or what it represents.
