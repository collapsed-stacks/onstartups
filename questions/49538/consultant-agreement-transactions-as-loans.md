I've been given a paper to sign where it says:

    You will be paid equivalent when/if SomeCompany makes turnover.  
    Eventually transactions between the parties must be seen as loans. 

What does that mean? Can they ask the money back from me or something?

<p>It's hard to say what that means, since it isn't written in proper English, and it seems to be taken out of context.</p>

<p>A fair <em>guess</em> is that it means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're not getting paid with money for the work you do.</li>
<li>You are getting 'paid' by <code>SomeCompany</code> agreeing to owe you money. In other words they acknowledge having a debt to you, and issue an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU" rel="nofollow">"I Owe You" document</a>.</li>
<li>Payment of their debt to you is dependent on <code>SomeCompany</code> getting sales (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover" rel="nofollow">turnover by them</a>).</li>
<li><strong>If <code>SomeCompany</code> doesn't achieve sales, then you're probably never paid.</strong> In this case you would most likely have an un-secured loan against a company that has gone bankrupt.</li>
</ul>

<p>See if the above seems to match the rest of the document you have, and your conversations with them. If it does, I would caution that this arrangement smells of amateurism, and it's unlikely you will ever see payment from them.</p>
