Is there a model to monetizing a custom Twitter app? 
whats the advantage of reusing twitter compared to building an independent twitter style app that does the job?

<p>If it's a webapp, you can always use AdSense or equivalent, but <a href="http://featuredusers.com/referral/pub-686/" rel="nofollow">Featured Users</a> is a nice way incorporate your monetization into the overall Twitter ecosystem. The model is that people buy banner placement in Twitter apps to try to get more followers. The app developers call the Featured Users api to show an ad and then get paid based on clicks. </p>
