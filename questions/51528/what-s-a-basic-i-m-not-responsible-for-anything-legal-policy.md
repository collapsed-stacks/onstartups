<p>I'm beginning to put out lightweight online communities pretty quickly -- about 1 every week! Many of these communities are oriented toward social change, and aim to provide the necessary infrastructures to make big social change and mass movements easy.</p>

<p>So naturally I'm worried about my liability, and also possibly making intelligence agencies interested in me.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>What's the most watertight and <em>simple</em> "I'm not responsible for anything" policy I can put on my sites as a US citizen?</p>

<p>What are some examples of cases where no matter what policy I state, I am still facing liability just because I wrote some code that provided a community infrastructure, and maybe some users used it to carry out illegal activities?</p>

<p>Is there any way I can definitely deny responsibility, or are there some lines I can't cross? For example, if I created some infrastructure whose instructions for use (written by me) would typically, but not necessarily, involve some illegal acts? (Assuming I never actually mention the illegal part, and the instructions could be used in a legal fashion.)</p>

<p>Do I ever have any responsibility to monitor user content/actions for illegality?</p>

<p><strong>This is a question for a qualified lawyer.</strong></p>

<p>All this "internet liability" issue is hard to understand and interpret. It also depends on the location (and it can be very complex! Consider a situation like this: you as provider are U.S. citizen, your data are stored on some server in Germany and some Somalian user is using it for illegal operations... A mess!)</p>

<p>Concerning location, I can tell you that <strong>here in Europe, even the judges hesitate how to interpret the involved legislation</strong> (often 50+ years old laws about telecommunication or press publishing - completely obsolete nowadays).</p>

<p><strong>So the only advice I can give you is to contact some local lawyer - if possible specialized in IT &amp; internet issues.</strong></p>

<p>And the very last thing: <strong>the <em>"I'm not responsible for anything"</em> policy DOESN'T EXIST!!! Be sure that you will ALWAYS be responsible in some way. This is just a myth and any such a clause will not protect you in case of law suit!</strong></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer</em></p>
