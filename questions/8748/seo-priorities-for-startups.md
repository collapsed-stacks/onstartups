<p>Since you are building now, getting the onpage things right first is priority. Then, when the onpage elements are in place, then you can work non-organic traffic generation efforts. </p>

<p>Given that you are choosing entertainment and events, you are navigating in pretty competitive waters - i would suggest reviewing SEOMoz'es <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/perfecting-keyword-targeting-on-page-optimization" rel="nofollow">Perfecting Keyword Targeting &amp; On-Page Optimization</a> post.</p>

<p>Also check out the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/24-onsite-seo-checkups-even-a-clueless-developer-marketer-should-do-when-launching-a-site" rel="nofollow">24 onsite checkups</a> list as well - still valid.</p>

The SEOmoz Ranking Factors is the bible of all the things you should be focussing on for SEO. It's updated each year and so up-to-date: http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors

Start a blog to drive traffic. Our site's 70% traffic is through blog http://www.skill-guru.com/blog/

In fact even before your site is live , start writing blog.
