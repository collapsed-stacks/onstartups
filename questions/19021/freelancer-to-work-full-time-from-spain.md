After having a freelancer make a site for me, I'm looking to have the designer to work for me for a longer set period of time, the problem is he's in Spain. Is there any other legal paperwork besides the engagement agreement in this situation? 

What are the implications? I know 37 signals does this? Any tips on having people from different timezones working full time?

I follow http://wideteams.com/ which is a website dedicated to sharing content on distributed teams management.

It has nice tips on techniques, tools and commons problems from their own experience and from time to time links to valuable articles on the subject.

I think you'll like it :).

I'm a US citizen who's worked as a freelance programmer for principals in Germany, England, France, and Canada. All we've ever done as legal paperwork has been a simple contract. So while I can't say for sure about Spain, I'd guess it's the same way.

Most of my work is long distance, and I've even done major projects for people I've never met. When working remotely, telephone, email, and IM, are your friends, and Skype voice/video is simply revolutionary.

You don't say where you're located, but I'm in California, and Spain is usually 9 hours ahead of us - so when it's 8 AM here, it's 5 PM there, which is not too bad. If you're much closer to Spain than I am, you can both talk during 9-5 office hours.

Hire a freelancer who will agree to work in your timezone.
Note: before hiring a freelancer read his feedbacks and profile carefully.
