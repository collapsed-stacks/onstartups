## Typical procedure for stock-for-stock asset purchase

I'm advising a friend who is selling her company in an asset purchase arrangement.  The acquirer is offering stock to the investors in her company.  However, the acquirer is asking that the stock be given first to the entity for her company and held there for a year before being distributed to the shareholders.  Is this standard practice in a stock-for-stock asset purchase agreement?

(I know this is a question for a lawyer but she's low on cash at the moment so trying to get as much "free advice" as possible.)

This is a negotiation and probably no rule of thumb. 

Shares maybe restricted or locked-up for a period of time. Two examples for why: 
- if the 'new' shares are in a public company, the public entity may want to delay the sales of shares. 
- the restricted shares can have specific vesting schedules to incentivize employees to carry out their work
