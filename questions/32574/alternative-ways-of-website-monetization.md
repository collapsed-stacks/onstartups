I'm developing a web application that will provide several services and the only ways for monetization I can think of are ads and donations. Are there any other mechanisms for monetizing a webpage? I am not asking about alternatives to Google Adsense, I'm interested in different models of monetization. 

Thanks.

 The revenue streams that immediately spring to mind are:

 1. Sell your own service (perhaps a premium level?)
 2. Sell other people's stuff to people (affiliate marketing)
 3. Sell eyeballs to other people (advertising space)
 4. Sell good feelings to people (donation button)
 5. Sell your soul (paid reviews for merchandise)
 6. Sell good feelings to other companies (sponsorship)
 7. Sell your experience running the website to other people (employment, write a book)
 8. Sell the website code to other companies (turnkey software)

As an aside, a friend used to edit a computer magazine. The major source of revenue was apparently not the advertisers or the subscribers: it was the special offers on products bundled with the magazine. (i.e. marketing agreements with software vendors where the magazine got a cut). Perhaps there is some arrangement you could make with companies selling into the same market?

 - Get those user stories: say you're not looking to sell anything right now but are in Limited Private Alpha.
 - Focus on one first: make it work, not suck and then awesome.
 - Cross promote with other businesses that add mutual value.
 - Meetups / events / conferences / booths.
 - Maybe the user is willing to trade other things (user generated content, code, etc.) for additional badges / status / features?

Also, people will say often say one thing and do another.  Measure, measure, measure with hard stats from your tech stack.
