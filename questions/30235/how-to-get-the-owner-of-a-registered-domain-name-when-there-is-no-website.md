I would like to register a .com domain but it appears it is already taken. However, there is no webpage at all. I get this: http://who.bluerazor.com/whois.aspx?domain=ryansoft.com&prog_id=bluerazor. 

Can I somehow buy that domain? How can I get the name of the company who registered the domain? How much do you think he could ask me?

<p>You can usually find the owner with a whois lookup -- go <a href="http://www.whois.net/">www.whois.net</a>. You can buy the domain if the owner wants to sell it, and the owner can ask you whatever he wants -- there's no standard amount. But if he's not using it he makes no money from keeping it, so he has an incentive to sell.</p>

Even though the domain of your choice has been purchased by someone, and if parked you can find the person and start bidding. If he is interested with your offer he will sell you the domain. This process can be done at www.sedo.com.

To find who owns the domain you can use a whois lookup. As Christian said, domain parkers will buy a domain with smart keywords for $10, and they will sell it for huge amount which starts from minimum of $250 and may even exceed to any cost.

You can't because they have registered it through a third party company (who is officially the owner).

You can try to contact  RYANSOFT.COM@domainsbyproxy.com, but i guess you'll not get an answer.

I don't think this domain is worth much, but usually domain grabbers aks for something starting at 500$.

- Can I somehow buy that domain? Probably, depends what is the domain. Some are cheap, some are expensive.
- How can I get the owner? Whois is you friend. If the contact information is missing in whois you can hope to contact via proxy email. If it is missing then probably the owner is not willing to sell. 
- How much do you think he could ask me? - How much a is the price of a car? $100-$1000000

If you want to register a domain name that has already been registered you can back order it. There are many providers providing back order services. If you do back order it, it means the person failed to renew it. 

Additionally, you can find the whois details by using one of the many free tools available. You just enter the domain name, and you can find all the details about the domain. Using these details you can contact the owner. Before asking him for a value, you can appraise the domain name by using many sites. By knowing the value of the domain you can bargain with the owner.

<p>I have done a whois lookup for RYANSOFT.COM in this site <a href="http://www.whoisxy.com/" rel="nofollow">WhoisXY.com</a>.Here the company information gets hided because the company registered their domain name under privacy registeration so you can't find the domain owner details.Privacy registration means hiding personal information in the whoissearch.</p>
