i see lot of vendors, SaaS or desktop software publishers always offering "Enterprise" version of their software.

when i look at the features, there's not much difference between "regular" and "enterprise" except the price tag of enterprise version which appear to be always at least $3000 USD.

what qualifies a software or SaaS as enterprise ? why would companies or coporations pay higher price tag ?


enterprise software appears to be attractive, i'd much rather focus on 10 clients bringing me lot of revenue than 100 retail clients who seem to require much more maintenance, support, and ass kissery.

Enterprises often require a number of additional features that are essential to them, but often irrelevant at much smaller scales.  This often includes:

 - **Flexible Security:**  You may need to be able to integrate with the corporate security infrastructure, allow for role-based security with a flexible number of roles to enable the organization to be split in different ways, etc.  You'll rarely be able to just have "Administrators" and "Everyone" for example.
 - **Auditing:**  Many enterprises want or even require (due to SOx, SAS-70, or other policy) auditing of configuration, security and even routine data changes
 - **Workflow and Approval:**  Most enterprises have different parties that must sign off on changes or participate in a process to complete it so the function your product provides may need to support breaking up a single process into discrete steps that can be routed between multiple parties with notification, etc.
 - **Branding:**  Bigger companies tend to insist on applying some form of look & feel change to web applications to make it feel like it's for them.
 - **Training:**  Enterprises recognize total cost in a way that small companies don't.  They want to know how they're going to train their employees to effectively use the product, and like to see materials for this.
 - **Guarantees of Support:**  Enterprises tend to put in writing things like how long you will support the version you're selling them and how.  They'll require things like guaranteed phone support 24x5.

As to why the cost, some of the reasons boil down to the sales process:  

 - **Enterprises like Salespeople:**  They want someone to shepherd them through the frequently log process from discovery to acquisition, deployment, and migration.  This also gets around turf challenges and ensures someone is trying to drive the process forward - namely you, the salesperson.
 - **Sales Process is Long and Easily Stopped:**  As the old saying goes, there are many people that can say no, very few that can say yes.  Another saying is that the sale isn't done until the commission check is spent.  These come from the hard truth of enterprise sales:  You can get all the way to having the PO in your hand, delivered the software, and be training the staff when the plug is pulled on the project.

In the end you often have to take the product to the next dimension which dramatically increases complexity and have to use a much more expensive sales process.  On the plus side, enterprises usually look at things from a value perspective vs. a cost perspective - this tool will save us $5M/year each of the next 2 years for an ROI of x, etc. so they can be very willing to pay much higher prices because it's about getting that value and ROI not necessarily what the out of pocket expense is.

Enterprise software is software that spans over many different areas of the organization not just one part of the company.

Normally when companies sell enterprise versions then it's about how many users or projects you can run simultaneously. For instance a project management tool that allow you at run unlimited projects vs. just 3.
