<br>
I am working on a new idea for an online service and it will be consist by me and two other persons.<br>I am the founder of it and the person with lead this startup.

I have a computer engineer bachelor degree and now I am studying for MBA. Jay is also a computer programmer, and Maria is a web designer.

I am not looking for funding before scale and my partners agreed to work for share. We are making this because of passion and faith for the result.

The idea aims to hit the global market, is not a local business.<br><br>What would be the appropriate share for my partners? What points should I have in mind? What should I be aware of?

Thank you.
