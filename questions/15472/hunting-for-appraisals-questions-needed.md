I have a few products and every product has a few satisfied customers.  It is great when customers are indeed telling good stuff about your product, but it is not easy to get it out of them.

So I created a questionnaire to help them.

Some of questions that are in it:

- How did the need [for the system] come about?
- Why did you need a way to [do stuff that system does]
- What group/department at [their company] does it help?
- How was it [the work] done before?
- What were the ramifications of doing nothing [not taking the system]?
- What does the system allow you to do that you couldn't do before?
 - technically
 - competitively
- Why did you choose [product]
- How much upkeep, overhead, or maintenance has it required?
- How much did you pay for [the system] over the course of the 2 years
- What is the financial payback

Is there any good resource for creating an interview of such kind?

<p>Based on your response to Martin, looks like you could use some pointers about creating useful surveys.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you need to understand your target base and perform the due diligence necessary to create a successful survey.  Asking open ended questions like "how did the need come about?" without any specific direction will likely yield poor results.</p>

<p>Here's a link to <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/SurveyMonkeyFiles/SmartSurvey.pdf" rel="nofollow">Survey Best Practices</a> distributed by Survey Monkey (not a software guide). Also <a href="http://knowledge-base.supersurvey.com/survey-audience.htm" rel="nofollow">http://knowledge-base.supersurvey.com/survey-audience.htm</a> has some insights.  <a href="http://www.qualitydigest.com/oct96/surveys.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.qualitydigest.com/oct96/surveys.html</a> is dated, but can be helpful as well.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
