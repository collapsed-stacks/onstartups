I'm looking for Virtual Assistance. However rather than an individual who can do low-level personal tasks like find a present for my wife, I'm looking for a full-service company that can do a wide range of business and technical functions. I want people who can think, and do advanced business and technical tasks.

This is for potentially a lot of the tasks involved in launching my startup, and also for my technical consulting work.

These tasks might be things like:

- Performing Business Research and compiling a report
- Preparing Competitor Analysis for a web application topic.
- Finding and Managing Outsourced Developers on specific tasks
- Compiling a guide on how to migrate a PHP app to the cloud
- Performing complex Excel Analysis or processing. 
- Apply some great visual design to Word, Excel or powerpoint documents
- Convert a mindmap into a powerpoint presentation

Basically I find I have so many tasks, I want to be able to shoot off emails to one address, and know that I am going to get some kind of quality response. A single general assistant may forward on specialist jobs to specialists.

A company specialising in providing services to Startups would be ideal, though not necessarily expected.

Brickworks was mentioned in Four-Hour Work Week, anybody have experiences with them, or have any other recommendations in this area?

You have some illusions waht a virtual assitant can provide.

> •Finding and Managing Outsourced Developers on specific tasks

Virtual PROJECT MANAGEMENT from a virtual assistant position? I suggest you look for a proejct manager offshore / freelancer for thais. This is not normal secretarial stuff.

> •Compiling a guide on how to migrate a PHP app to the cloud

What about he WRIOTE PHP? Getting more unrealistic?

> •Performing complex Excel Analysis or processing. 

Like your secretary would? THis is stuff for a master of mathematics / statistics, or very specialized. People earn a lot of money for being able to do that. Unlewss naturally your and my definition of "complex analysis / processing" is different.

> •Apply some great visual design to Word, Excel or powerpoint documents

Again, a virtual Assistant will not be a full time designer.

Seriously, half what you say makes sense, but all those points are not something I wold ever expect from a virtual assistant.
