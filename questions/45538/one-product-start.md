We have a one product company that has a patent on a fitness product. There are 3 of us. Guy #1 who thought of the idea, guy#2 who built the prototype(very simple one piece item with no moving parts) and sent it to the patent attorney, and guy#3 who funded the filing. We have not been able to license the product. Guy#3 has suggested that he might fund the company, as much as 75k. He has also sourced the engineer and the manufacturer and will also be in charge of marketing. How would the percentages of the company breakout for each guy? Thank you.
