I understand the reporting and tax rules pertaining to using a company-purchased vehicle for personal use, but I wanted to know if the same rules apply to a rental car being expensed by the company for personal use?

Some factors such as:

 - Is it considered a taxable fringe benefit for the employee?
 - Does the company have to report the proportion of personal use on the vehicle against the expense of the rental company as a taxable wage/income?
