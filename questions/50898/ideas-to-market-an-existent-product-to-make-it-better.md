The idea I have  is something that I had in mind for years and found a solution that works great it is one that I have never seen marketed for how I use the Product.
In using the product I have had already people comment on this great idea realizing its solving problem that is an everyday event.
The bottom line how do you protect an marketing idea if a product is out there already working and my idea would be sold with a different slant.

You would be covered under copyright for any text or images you produce but you will likely be infringing the original product producers intellectual property.
