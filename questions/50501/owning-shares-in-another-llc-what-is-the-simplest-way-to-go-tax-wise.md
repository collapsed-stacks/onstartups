## Owning shares in another LLC, what is the simplest way to go tax-wise?

Let's say I already own a LLC (single-member, disregarded entity). Now, I just closed a new business and have a partner in the US, a new LLC will be formed, with two members - my partner and I.

I know that in this case, I'll be under IRS' radar because this would be a two member LLC. Would it be simpler to just add my current LLC to own shares in the new company?

Any suggestions appreciated!

Disclaimer: I don't have any issues with paying taxes. I'm just curious about the simplest way to go. Getting an ITIN is a lengthy process and I would rather avoid it as long as possible.

What does this mean? Under what radar? How's amount of members relevant?

LLCs don't have shares, they have members. Tax-wise (US Federal) your SMLLC is a disregarded entity, so tax-wise there's no difference whether you're a member as an individual or SMLLC (US Federal). State tax laws may be different, and since you appear to be a foreigner - your own country's laws are important as well.

But you said you already have a LLC in the US, so you should have gotten a tax id by now. Why would being a member of yet another LLC make any difference? The ITIN is for you, not for the LLC.
