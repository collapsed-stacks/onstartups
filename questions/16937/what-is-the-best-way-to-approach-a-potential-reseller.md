I have a list of companies I want to approach, but I'm not sure what to say when I call them, or who I should be contacting within the company. Any ideas? I am in the software business.

 - Be sure that you are able to present
   clear benefits that a reseller would
   have by selling your product. Detail
   the compensation, the product, and
   your level of support to them as a
   reseller. Also important is who
   handles customer support. At this
   level, the business case for your
   product is just as important as the
   actual product itself. Having a case
   study or two at hand to send them if
   they are interested would be
   extremely beneficial.
 - Prepare your answers to any questions
   they may have. You should be able to
   answer any question about the
   product, its market, and its sales
   history.
 - Find the proper contact for each
   reseller on your list. If possible,
   find people who can make decisions.
 - Tailor your pitch to each company.
   Research the company first and try to
   understand their market and how your
   product will benefit their customers.
 - Keep the call or email short and
   professional. Be assertive, but not
   too pushy. Don't leave the onus of contact on them. Tell them you will contact them again if they are even marginally interested.
 - If you say you're going to call back
   or email, do it and do it on time.
