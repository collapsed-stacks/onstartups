No matter who you choose, there is always the possibility that they will take advantage of you. However, someone from the same industry who is willing and able to be a mentor will likely be able to provide you with more relevant advice for your business in particular.

It's a common mis-conception that other people are prone to stealing ideas. Yes, it does happen, but ideas really aren't worth much without execution. If you're providing a solid execution, it's more likely that someone interested in edging in on your business will try to do so with you than against you.
