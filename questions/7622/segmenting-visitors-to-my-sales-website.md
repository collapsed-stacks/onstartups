I have made a simple sales web page to generate leads for my new business. 

One problem I think I have is that the current web page tries to be "all things to all visitors", when in actuality I know I have at least three different "segments" for my customers.

Since the customers for each niche don't overlap much, I think I should change the website to target each kind of visitor.

I see a few options:

 1. Have a "generic" main page with some general information. And then let the users "self select" which niche interests them by clicking a link. The link sends them to another page with more details for their specific niche.
 
 2. Make specific drop pages for each type of visitor. And try to get Google and the search engines to direct searches to the right drop page. Not have a home page at all.

 3. Both of above.

 4. Some other way? Like having a separate website for each niche.

I not asking for a critique of my site, but if you need a more concrete example, [here is the site][1]. The three "segments" are:

 - Sports Agents
 - Entertainment Agents (TV, Movies, Music)
 - Political parties and campaign managers.

Your landing page seems to be pretty good in terms of segmenting your markets clearly for customers to click on. Your segmentation, while slightly different, follows the same Intellectual Property theme -- you just bucket it into specific types of IP. I think that's a good idea.

I don't see your customers getting confused over this nor the need for separate landing pages. I do like the fact that each segment is clearly defined and that you can see the benefits. It's probably a good idea that customers also see that you have depth in the IP area, outside their interests. I know it does not seem like it but those 3 areas do overlap. Actors become political candidates, sports figures migrate into entertainment and political candidates sometimes get talk shows.

<p>Agree with Jarie - the page is pretty clear what path each usertype would take given their interest. Two other good examples of sites with different usertypes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://salary.com" rel="nofollow">Salary.com</a> its pretty clear where visitors should go based on their intent. </li>
<li><a href="http://theladders.com" rel="nofollow">theladders.com</a> categorizes jobs (sales, technology, finance, marketing)</li>
</ul>

<p>theladders is a bit different, in that each category brings you to a particular subsite (technology.theladders.com) where once the visitor joins, they never really see the homepage again. </p>

<p>If you believe that each of your markets have no cross interests (i.e. technology job searchers would not be interested in sales jobs or sales job news) <strong>and</strong> intend on creating specific content for each section, perhaps an approach like theladders would be beneficial to you. </p>

I don't understand why you wouldn't invest the time and effort to have three separate, branded websites, specifically geared towards each of these industries.  That seems to be the reasonable step, but maybe I hadn't taken something of your business into consideration.
