I am in the process of creating a startup in an existing market and through research found that in order to win customers from competitors, I need them to "adopt" my product/service as their own. 

To make the question clearer:
Do you know of any research or theories that I can follow to increase the adoption rate?

I am specifically looking for psychological mechanics of adoption of a service or any theory that provides some form of method to expand on. 

For example: What mental strain strategies to use that creates personal buy in or association to service. Stack Exchange uses a system where credibility is earned over a period with additional services being offered as a reward for interaction with the site. This greatly helps in increasing the adoption rate of the site. 

I am looking for similar strategies.  

Thanks for your feedback.

<p>Best way?  Create a product that provides more value for your customers than your competitor does.  There's no other way to do it.  </p>

<p>As far as particular methodologies you might find to create a product that warrants adoption, one great place to start is the <a href="http://startuplessonslearned.com" rel="nofollow">lean startup</a> methodologies pushed by Eric Reis and Steve Blank.  Look at Ash Maurya's <a href="http://ashmaurya.com" rel="nofollow">blog</a> (and book) for some more tactical suggestions toward lean product development as well.</p>

So... you're trying to get competitors' customers to switch to your service?

There are a few ways you could go about this. One of the most effective ways is Google AdWords targeted at your competitors' brand names, with ad copy that highlights why you're better / what your big differentiator is. (e.g. "Looking for Sprocket Co.? Try Widget, Inc. - 30% cheaper and 50% more results!")

You can also tap into organic search traffic by creating content that targets keywords like "[Competitor Name] review", "[Competitor Name] alternative", or "[Competitor 1 Name] vs [Competitor 2 Name]" (include your own company in this comparison as well).

And search for communities where customers in your industry discuss vendors / tools. Get involved there.
