When you are accepted into an early-stage incubator and they give an investment of $18K, how do they expect you to allocate the funds? How much goes towards salary? Product Development? Sales & Marketing?

I would expect that they expect you to be able to answer those questions.

Part of the reason why companies are selected for the process is because they have well thought out strategies or direction.  

I do not know if they require you to spend it on a certain piece of the business, but I would be surprised.  $18k is not a lot of money - more for like to relocate the cofounders to the Bay area, get an apartment, business supplies, computers, stuff like that.
