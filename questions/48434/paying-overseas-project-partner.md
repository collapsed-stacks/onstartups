I am in the state of Montana, USA and have an app that my friend in the Netherlands and I built. I'm in charge of taking payments and I'm getting ready to send a payment his way. I'm wondering, what is the cheapest way to send a payment both now and long term? Right now we're not incorporated (and don't intend to be for this project) but it's something I'm considering for future projects. I guess I'm not sure how to go about this in the most legal yet cost effective manner. Any suggestions?

Ask your friend to send you payment instructions from his bank. Then take that to your bank and ask them so send him the money. Simple as that.

Regarding taxes on his side (or yours) you should consult a lawyer.
