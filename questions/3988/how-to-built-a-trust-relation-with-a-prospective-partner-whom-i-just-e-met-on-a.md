I am a first time entrepreneur, still in the initial phase. I have a good business idea in the online travel industry. I've some experience in the industry, but as a business analyst and not technical. I've the business plan ready and now looking for a technical partner with expertise in web applications, scrum project management. In one of the industry forums, I asked the question about the best way to find such a person, and a few people wrote to me who were interested themselves. And after a couple of e-interactions, I feel that one of them could be the right person. 

He is on other side of the planet. And since I do not know him personally or have a common reference, can I do something to built some trust before I share the entire plan with him. 

Any other advice?

Regards,
Anshumaan

A tough one. Nothing can replace meeting in person and getting to know each other (over years).

What I would do:

- set up some video conferences
- let him implement something small within your frame of expertise for you
- let him give you some references, people he worked for

From personal experience: I used to work from Switzerland into Russia, Spain, Italy, UK, US, Canada, Germany, ... I found it very hard the more cultures differ. Building trust with somebody from the other side of the planet might function well for similar cultures, but otherwise I advice you to be very cautious. This might not be politically correct, and both parties may mean really well, but due to misunderstandings and cultural assumptions projects will need much additional attention. I found it necessary to fly there and meet the people for extended periods 2-3 times a year.

Be aware of legal culture in the other country as well. I say culture as the written law alone does not suffice. How is the copyright treated? Is there a culture of "everything I wrote and the tools I used to do so are mine" as I experienced in one of the above countries?

Just my 2 cents.

I totally agree with the previous response. If you don't have time to build that relationship, search locally for the tech guy. In any case, have "the guy/gal" implement tiny subsets that sort of get you there over time.

Never, ever share your business plan - because that's a plan for you (and your investors when you get there). Actually it's just for you, because they don't like lengthy plans anyway!

As a new entrepreneur, it sounds like you're already packing too much into what you really need. So for example: "Scrum project management" - there's no need for project management, because you are it. If you put another business manager in charge, they wont get it the way you want (and might walk away with/without the jewels eventually). Things like software scrum are only needed to speed up development for large software projects in large companies.

Think Twitter: Start something small that runs from a small web server on your computer. Build some functionality. If it works on a laptop (hint: using http://localhost), then it's easier to show to potential investors. This is not to say that it has to be small - especially if you have the ambition to be the next Expedia and plan to raise millions in an angel round :) It just means that if you've only recently been born as an entrepreneur, you need to get your legs under you before you hope to expand rapidly. In fact, reaching out to a tech guy on the other side of the planet points to the twitter size anyway (at least before they grew to millions of users).

Good luck.

 1. Meet at least once in the analog
    life AKA the real life. 
 2. If #1 is not an
    option, video conference. 
 3. If #1 and
    #2 are not an option, phone call.

From my experience, breaking the numerical barrier is a must for building trust.

They have to:

 1. Show you something they've built (hopefully close to what you want)
 2. Prove they've built it 
 3. Show they are willing to commit the time to your project.

The guy next door can blow as much smoke (pick your direction) as the one across the ocean; it will be up to you do see the difference.

The same thing happened to me. I basically asked, "how do I attract a technical co-founder, I have 'XYZ'". Several people contacted me, one of whom had an amazing portfolio. I flew across the country within the next week to meet him. The meeting went great, the guy is great, has lots of great ideas, etc. I only wish he would communicate better. We hope to launch in two months and I'll let you know how it goes.
