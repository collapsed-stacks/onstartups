Our paying customers are online fashion store owners.  
This is a hard task for me to approach them for the very first time. 
I went to their online store and can't find any appropriate department like marketing department.  
They mostly only have a customer service contact form.

Can anyone advice me for the very first step to approach them appropriately?  
If you were me, what will you do to approach them?  
You can't visit their store in person because of the distance or any other reason.

Yes - its never easy to find company contacts / info on a b2c site.  Focus is on customer / ecomm, not corporate info.  

Suggest searching company name in linkedin or google "companyname CEO" or "companyname business development" - you'll likely find a hit from one of them.
