I am looking into buying insurance for my at home business.  I will need to insure, not only my home, but also the equipment inside and have all of the regular business insurance plans (property, general liability, ommisions and errors, etc) I heard that an insurance broker is more helpful and thorough than your typical agent.  First, any truth to that, then how much am I looking for coming out of pocket?  Thank you in advance for your expert advice.

I've never paid a broker.  They make money on commissions from the insurance company.  For business insurance, I've had good success with techinsurance.com.

First of all, the broker will receive a commission on the insurance you purchase, you will not pay them directly.

Second, I would recommend going through an insurance broker. An insurance broker will help you by assessing the liabilities of your industry, help you determine the coverage you need and find the lowest price for the insurance you require. A good broker will check with multiple  insurance companies to determine the best price.

Also, an insurance broker will be a useful source as your business grows.
