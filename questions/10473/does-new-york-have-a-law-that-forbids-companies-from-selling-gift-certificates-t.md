I recently read that Groupon was sued because Illinois law forbids companies from selling gift certificates that expire within five years. Does New York have a similar law? If they do, what is it?

Thank you!

<p>Federal law now prohibits gift cards from expiring within five years (This happened in August of 2010).</p>

<p>But you can read about all kinds of NY specific issues on the NY Comptroller's website: <a href="http://www.osc.state.ny.us/ouf/giftcards.htm" rel="nofollow">Are you planning to buy or use a gift card?</a></p>
