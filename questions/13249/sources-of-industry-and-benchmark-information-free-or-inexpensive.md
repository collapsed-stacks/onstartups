What are some of the best free (or almost free) sources of updated and historical industry data, analysis, and comparative benchmark information?

For example:  Restaruant industry average food and labor cost, or average occupancy rates and average daily rooom rates for hotels, etc.

I have access to Standard & Poors reports and data via the investment firm that is host to my retirement accounts.  However, for those who do not have such access, the cost to obtain the info from S&P is quite expensive.  I wonder if there are in-depth sources out there that are free or nearly free.

There are several different government sources that are free and accurate.  Many other commercial sources actually rehash government data.

<li> http://www.bea.gov/
<li> http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/default.htm
<li> http://www.census.gov/econ/census07/index.html

You might also search for an Industry related Association for Restaurants and Hotels, which usually prepare such data for their members. Some give these data away free of charge.

May be the International Hotel and Restaurants Association ( http://www.ih-ra.com/ ) could help you.
