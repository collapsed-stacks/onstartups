What do you do with paying customers if your startup "fails" and you want to discontinue support/development/hosting of your product/service?

 1. If possible, **sell your service to a competitor** -- if needed set the price rock bottom low, but get the new owners to take over and offer to migrate existing customer data to their service.
 2. **Say it as it is,** tell your customers that you are closing down the service. If possible, offer to keep the service running for a couple of months without charge, as a token of gratitude for your customers, and to give your customers time to find alternative solutions. As a last kindness, maybe you can provide a data export functionality so that your customers can retrieve their data.

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. There could be legal provisions in your state about this topic, for example how long prior warning you have to give on a change of terms. See a lawyer for legal advice. :-)

**Edit:** This answer is assuming that you don't have any ongoing contracts (such as software maintenance contracts) with your customers, but just a simple monthly subscription service with a terms of service sheet.

Several ways:

 1. Find someone else to take the reigns.  Often a consultant who can use it for billable hours.
 1. Sell to another related startup, even if "sell" means $1000.  Or free, just to get continuity.
 1. Find a competitor willing to swap your product for theirs.  Sounds crazy but they get the maintenance stream, the upsell to new products, and any new seats purchased.  Also if there's more than one competitor one might do it just to make sure the other doesn't.
 1. The competitor won't just swap, perhaps they can offer discounted licenses for the swap.
 1. Maybe you just give up.  It happens.  :-(

During my career I've had to on occasion discontinue product lines, close whole business units, and most recently a failed startup (RFID tracking systems).  Options that I've found work:

1.  Agreed to make end of life shipments.
2.  Turned over support of software to former employees and enable them to act as independent consultants.  This also required us to transfer certain assets to them to enable this.
3.  Turned over customers to other supplier partners who were involved in the same projects.
4.  In one case, spun out a division to employees in an MBO, thus keeping support going.

As Jesper points out, there may be potential legal ramifications.  I'm not sure if you had written contracts and what provisions (if any) were written in about warranty and support, but these will generally govern.  Most contracts we wrote had some kind of notice period regarding change of products, services, or prices ranging from 30 days to 12 months depending on the type of business.

However as Jesper also pointed out, in the failure case, when we explained the situation to customers, I've never had a customer who was not understanding and in all cases was able to work out satisfactory transition arrangements.

I'm with Jason, make an attempt to sell to someone else that can maintain it -- even if the price ends up being pretty low.

Another option (based on the situation) is releasing the code itself to the community.  This way, others (perhaps even a group of your customers) can take it over if they're desperate enough.
