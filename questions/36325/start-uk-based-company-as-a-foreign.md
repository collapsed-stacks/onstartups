Can you start/register a company in UK without being a UK citizen and living elsewhere? If so, what are the implications?

You can certainly register a limited company in the UK, however you'll need a registered office in the UK. You can register a company online and the registered office will be your company agent's address.
It cost me less than £200 to register my company, and the price also included:

- a UK-based registered office for 2 years with statutory mail forwarding,
- preparation and filling of anual returns for 2 years,
- a domain,
- £50 Google Adwords voucher,
- a few ebooks on running a business,
- PAYE registration,
- a training course on running a company in London, etc.

If you trade from abroad you'll also need apostilled documents to open a bank account in your country (this cost me £120). The Companies House website also says you'll have to send anual returns and anual accounts at least every half a year, however I don't know yet whether they mean anual returns/accounts as if they were sent  at the end of a year or just working compies of those reports. The information on the website is slighly unclear, and I'm going to contact the CH regarding this issue.

This link on the UK Companies House website would be a good place to start:

http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/companyRegistration.shtml

There is also a (partial) list of company formation agents who can take care of the formalities on your behalf, for a fee:
