## Can it be a good idea to lease a house rather than a standard office-space for a software development shop?

Our lease is up on our US-based office-space in July, so it's back on my radar to evaluate our office-space situation.

Two of our partners rather like the idea of leasing a house rather than standard office-space. 

We have 4 partners and one employee. 

I'm against the idea at this moment in time.

**Pros, as I see them**

 - Easier to get a good location (minimize commutes)
 - All partners/employees have dogs. Easier to work longer hours without dog-duties pulling people back home
 - More comfortable bathroom situation
 - Residential Internet Rate
 - Control of the thermostat 
 - Clients don't come to our office, so this would not change our image
 - The additional comfort-level should facilitate a significantly higher-percentage of time "in the zone" for programmers and artists. 

**Cons, as I see them**

 - Additional bills to pay (house-cleaning, yard, util, gas, electric)
 - Additional time-overhead in dealing with bills (house-cleaning, yard, util, gas, electric)
 - Additional overhead required to deal with issues that maintenance would have dealt with in a standard office-space
 - Residential neighbors to contend with

The equation starts to look a little nasty when factoring in potential time-overhead, especially on issues that a maintenance crew would deal with at a standard office complex. 

Can this be a good thing for a software development shop?

I've known shops that did this successfully. It's a common model in neighborhoods going through gentrification.

The overhead of dealing with bills won't be a lot, and you can pay someone to mow the lawn. The main issue you'd have is if you were bad neighbors due to coming and going late at night, or being loud, which doesn't sound like an issue. Though you may want to check the rules for the number of dogs allowed in one residence.

The main drawback will be in what it does to the atmosphere. It'll make things more casual, which may be good, but it may also lead to things getting too casual. What level of professionalism you need in your environment is something only you can judge.
