## bootstrapped startup needs to be creative about "enaging" with out of house expertise

Fanciful title really translates in simple English as this:

*We are (read **I am**) a bootstrapped, cash strapped startup and I need to employ the services of outsite experts but want to a). minimise any impact on my short term cashflow b). get results (that generate **actual income**) for any fees I pay to said expert.*

I have a definite skill set - which happens to exclude anything remotely to do with sales and marketing. In all other areas though, I am good - VERY good. I have identified a business opportunity, and I am creating a business to satisfy that need. 

Up until now, I thought that you "build a better mousetrap, and the world would beat a path to your door". That is patently not true. I have built my website, and realized that no one is beating a path to my door - simply because they don't know I exist.

Ok, so the reality is this: I need someone/a team with marketing/branding expertise to help do the inbound marketing, and general branding/sales/marketing related activities - which I am not good at.

However, since I am funding this from my own hard earned money, I hate the idea of forking out my hard earned life savings (thats right!), to some smooth talking sales guy/woman, who charges ridiculous fees for doing something "arty farty" that can't be quantified and measured, and then simply "waltzes off" into the sunset, leaving me with a (totally avoidable - in my view) cashflow problem.

Don't get me wrong - I LOVE paying for results. I have no problem with paying for work **IF** and **only IF**, it results in results (pardon the pun) - i.e. site membership registrations, member conversion into customers etc.

I want to work with someone/a team who is creative in their approach to new work, who don't mind putting their money where their mouth is, and share the risk with me - so that they eat ONLY what they manage to hunt (in a manner or speaking).

Finally, I have two questions:

1. How can I structure a contract to an individual (or team), so that they either defer payment until results accrue (say past a threshold number) - the payment can be at a set % higher than what they would normally charge, as a reflection of the "risk premium" - is there standard wording for such a contract, and where may I obtain such a contract from?

2. Are there any companies out there that are skilled in the branding/sales/marketing area that are willing to come "on board" with me on this?. Geographical location is not important since we can "telecommute"

<p>At a very high level who is the customer? A retail online surfer or a corporate account. Can your product be sold online without a face to face sales call or does it requires an involved multi stage, multi month sales cycle. If I stumbled across it online would I buy it?</p>

<p>If you can sell it online, there is a lot of material out there on developing your customers. Even if you are not selling online check out Steve Blank <a href="http://steveblank.com/category/customer-development/" rel="nofollow">Customer Development Page</a> and you should be able to answer a number of questions yourself as well as get comfortable with the sales process. </p>

<p>Like development, testing and requirements gathering sales is also a process that needs to be managed. Ultimately to assess the effectiveness of your sales partner/team, you have to sell yourself. Otherwise it will  always be some dark magic that you wouldn't get. Given the picture you have shared, I would recommend that you start pitching first till you find someone who can deliver and perform.  </p>

<p>If your product is good, designed in collaboration with customers and in demand, I am sure you can find a sales professional who is willing to work on a revenue sharing basis. How and where you find them is a function of your location, your market and your customers. </p>

What you are looking for is a partnership with another company. Try and find a company where you offer a non-competing but complementary product. Something where they can feed you leads and pay you from those leads. If you are really lucky you may even be able to strike an affiliate deal. The better your product the more options you should have. In this method you are leveraging the marketing resources that another company may have spent years developing or is simply better at doing. 

Good Luck!

Here are a couple options:

 - There are telemarketing type companies that try and setup leads / meetings. They only get paid when they make a valid meeting or get a good lead. You could setup that type of arrangement with someone. A cost per registration, sign-up, something like that.
 - Look at recent graduates, younger people may be willing to take a risk and not get paid until results are seen. Of course they will have to be 'sold' on your product themselves.
 - I don't know any expensive marketing companies that would engage in this type of scenario. They like the option to waltz off and not be out any money ;)
 - Partner with companies that have clients similar to ones you want and have them help sell your product
 - Create an affiliate program where you can tell where people sign-up from and pay people for leads / accounts made
 - Bring in a 'business partner' with marketing and sales experience that you trust and loves your idea

If you want to create an agreement than you just have to figure out what is actually measurable and use those as your metrics to pay the person. Assuming you both can agree on what is reasonable and what should be paid for certain results it shouldn't be too painful.

(This post wound up being tl;dr. Sorry.)

Here's a quick analogy. 

You sound like you are a technical person, such as a developer. 

Suppose an "idea man" contacted you and told you that they wanted you to contribute your talents to their venture without up front money, and for you to only get paid when the venture starts to return revenues. So this "idea man" who claims to have sales and marketing expertise is saying that he has a "sure thing" and only needs your contribution. 

He wants you to spend X months writing a program that he claims that he will sell, and this will make both of you money. 

And you don't know this person at all right now. He contacts you out of the blue. You have to trust that he has a great idea. That he will be fair about rewarding your efforts. That you have no better opportunity at hand. 

This is exactly what you are asking, except turned around. I placed you in the role of the "hypothetical partner". 

EVERY startup I have ever spoken with wants exactly what you want: assured results from engaging with an outsider, with no investment or risk the startup's part. 

Not going to happen. 

As a reality check, Google for "copywriter" - a type of marketing expert - look at the top copywriter's web sites, and see if any of them will work only for a share of the profits or will guarantee their work. 

This has symmetry with the OP's contention that he does not want to pay a "slick talking sales type" lots of money with no results. From the marketer's point of view, the OP lacks a track record of selling a product or service successfully so on the other side he is unclear whether his time will be wasted. 

Only a hideously inexperienced marketer (IE: one who really isn't a marketer) would walk into this trap. Or someone who tells the OP exactly what he wants to hear. 

There is also a logical contradiction in what the original poster wants. The contradiction is that the original poster wants guaranteed results, which implies that he is hiring a top marketing person, but *anyone* with the ability to guarantee results will not be available at the scale or money that the OP is able to pay. 

There is a much better way to go forward, and it involves discarding the OP's assumptions about sinister greedy sales people who are out to con everyone, as well as the black and white thinking about assuming that there is either success or failure, switched on or off like a light switch. 

The bottom line is this: You should expect to pay anyone decent, and anyone decent isn't interested in gambling in order to get paid. Competent, proven people don't work for free or on speculations. And your business as it now stands is a gamble to everyone. You are bringing little to the table. 

Secondly, you should expect to pay for a LITTLE advice - a review of your site, your materials, your entire business plan - from someone with a demonstrable track record in developing new business. 

I develop copy for ISVs and I find that those starting out have very fundamental BUT relatively straightforward to correct flaws in their premise or their copy. 

It often comes down to something very obvious (to an outsider) like unreadable copy that is written by a programmer that contains no bullet points or titles, or the absolute absence of benefits and the overwhelming of the reader with technical details. These, by the way, are the most common problems with all newbie copy. 

I'm saying that your current problems with your offer are probably relatively obvious to the right eyes. It should not cost much even for an experienced copywriter or marketer to make a "first order" pass through everything you're doing now and tell you what needs to be corrected. 

Or maybe it's not even a copy problem. Maybe your search engine standing is poor. Or maybe you can't market your type of service by the internet and instead you need to market directly to users. I tell my clients, don't expect a $5000 B2B product to sell itself through a web site right out of the gate. 

Another thing you should do is discard the thinking that a really effective marketer is going to wave a magic wand with no participation from you, and that they will disappear for months and cost you six digits. 

No client allows *anyone* to work like that. Why would you ever let them? 

You should know if the work is on-track simply because you will see someone else's work on a daily or weekly basis and you will react to it as a new prospect would. You look for revisions and work that make sense to you and which seem to correct problems. 

If you think the work is shoddy or stupid, you stop it early and you fire the person and you find someone else. 

One last thing. If you develop an ongoing relationship with a competent marketer, you should experience a bit of internal transformation yourself. You should start to see the things that the marketer sees. Eventually, every small business owner needs to be their own marketer, and you will come to rely on the marketer less and less. 

But you need active mentorship from an experienced professional in order for this to happen.
