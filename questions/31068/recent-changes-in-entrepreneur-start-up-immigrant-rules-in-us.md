I have read recent changes/updates on entrepreneurs/start-up immigrant visa in US.

http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/20110802-napolitano-startup-job-creation-initiatives.shtm

According to this, foreign national can work as employer & employee in start-up and can apply for green card in EB2 category. It's a great change for people like me with an entrepreneurial dream. 

I'm on H1B vista in IT field and planning for an IT start-up company here. But requirements and conditions/rules are not clear like no of people in the company, starting investment, infrastructure of company etc. 

Does anyone know more about it or have any insight on it?

I would read the rules thoroughly.  EB-series visas can have an investment requirement, and articulate a clear relationship between investment in the US and visa eligibility.  EB2, last I looked at it, required up to $1M investment and/or the promise of creating X full-time jobs.  There was a version of the visa that reduced the investment requirement if the endeavor is put up in a disadvantaged area of the US.

Of course, consult an immigration attorney.
