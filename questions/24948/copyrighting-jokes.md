## Copyrighting jokes?

I have an app that is essentially a game, but is based off different riddles. So the riddles are pretty much jokes with funny answers, and all are original. My questions is: is it possible to copyright all the jokes collectively so that no one would be able to use them commercially? The jokes are only a few sentences long. So besides getting a trademark on each joke individually, would there be anyway to just get a copyright of the entire app and all of its contents?

<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>

<p>Because a joke is typically short, your are close to the blurry line of what is copyrightable and what is not.  I would say each joke is copyrightable as long as it</p>

<ul>
<li>is not really short (less than 5-10
words)</li>
<li>is not a variant of a typical joke (knock knock, a man walks into a bar)</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of having copyright of each joke, you can also get copyright to a collection of jokes.  You can do this even if not all of the jokes are original to you.</p>

<p>By merely publishing your app, you have copyright to the contents of your app.  For additional protection, you could seek a copyright registration from the Copyright Office.  This has several <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html" rel="nofollow">advantages</a> (it will be required if you ever need to sue for infringement of a U.S. work), but it isn't immediately necessary.  </p>

<p>The hard part is what to do if someone violates your copyright by using your jokes without your permission.  That typically requires a lawyer and thus money.</p>

<p><strong>Trademark</strong></p>

<p>You cannot trademark a joke as the purpose of a trademark is to identify your product or service and jokes do not do that.</p>
