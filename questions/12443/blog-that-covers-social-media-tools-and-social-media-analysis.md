I'm familiar with Mashable.com, but what I'm looking for is a blog or site that just covers social media tools. By tools I'm referring to things that help you analyze the social web. Below are some examples:

 - http://analytics.ad.ly/
 - http://www.trendrr.com/
 - http://boardreader.com/


Does a blog like this exist? Thanks for your help.

Good question. I know of no such blog, so perhaps there's a niche for one ;-)

But in case you're actually looking for info & opinions on social media tools, and not sniffing out potential blog niches, here are a few blogs that are tangentially related and occasionally mention social media tools and their usefulness to social media marketers:

 * http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/
 * http://forrester.typepad.com/groundswell/
 * http://blog.hubspot.com/
 * http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/
 * http://www.marketingzen.com/online-marketing-blog
 * http://www.readthis.com/
 * http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/
 * http://www.communityguy.com/
 * http://www.emerkirrane.com/
 * http://www.tawheedkader.com/

Hope this helps.

<p>Have you checked out the <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Hubspot.com blog</a>? It's not strictly focused on social media tools, but it is a social media blog.</p>

<p>They also have a <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/web-analytics-marketing-hub/" rel="nofollow">web analytics marketing hub</a> that may be of interest to you.</p>
