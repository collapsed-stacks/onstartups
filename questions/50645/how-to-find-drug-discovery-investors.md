I own 30% ip royalties in an undeveloped simulated set of treatments for HIV and cancer but I do not have the capital to run the experiments necessary to validate my results. Are there investors for drug discovery and clinical research? If so how do I find them?

<p>Yes, there is a whole biomedical investment industry. Relatively few investors (and VCs) will invest in bi-medical investments, because you need so much capital to make it through the long process to get your treatment fully approved and rolled out. Some will.</p>

<p>You are at a very awkward stage, where I would suggest that you go after private angel investors, otherwise known as <a href="http://blog.venturelynx.com/2013/08/19/do-you-want-smart-or-dumb-investors/" rel="nofollow">'dumb money'</a>. These are wealthy individuals, who are often older, since being older gives you more time to accumulate wealth. Older people tend to be more conscious of health issues and wanting to leave a legacy behind, so a treatment for HIV and cancer would be very attractive to many of them.</p>

<p>Whichever type of investor you are interested in, you will want to put the right team of people together to build out this business. Without the right people involved and working full time, you won't get many investors.</p>
