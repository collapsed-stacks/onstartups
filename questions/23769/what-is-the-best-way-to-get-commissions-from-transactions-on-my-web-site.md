I am thinking building web application where buyers and sellers  could meet and buy/sell items/service.   (There wont be any item to sell butthey will pay for service )

But i dont know how to get commission like (http://www.freelancer.co.uk) but i am not sure about there will be bidding or not but the question is hot to get commision

Should i have my own account and get money buyer and send to seller when service is done?

Is there any detailed architecture / work flow / article etc. about this kind of process?

Does paypal or any other payment gateways support this kind of features?

You could use Paypal's adaptive payments. It will allow you to split payments between you and the seller. https://www.x.com/community/ppx/adaptive_payments
