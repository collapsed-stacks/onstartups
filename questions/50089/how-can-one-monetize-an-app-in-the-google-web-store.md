I have a couple of apps on the Windows Phone Store with a decent number of downloads. I was thinking about converting them to iOS or Android, but then I started looking into the Chrome Web Store. I tried to find some success stories for Chrome Web Store, but couldn't find any.

Can anyone with experience with the Google Web Store explain how one can successfully monetize an app?

 There isnâ€™t going to be a one-size-fits-all answer in this area. Each publisher and developer will need to make a choice based on their current business model. The Chrome Web Store supports multiple monetization models such as:

    

 - **One-time purchase:** You can sell your product and service to users
   with a one-time fee.

   

 - **Subscription:** You have the option to sell a subscription to your
   product or service
      
 - **Freemium:** You can deliver a minimum level of functionality that
   allows users to try your product or service and then decide to upgrade to a more
   full-featured version for a fee.

    

 - **Free, ad-supported:** You can distribute your items at the store for
   free but show ads in them. There are plenty of ad networks you can
   use to do so - or you can sell the space in your app directly as a
   sponsorship.



 - **Free, referral-based:** You can choose to use referral-based advertising directing users to e-commerce sites, for example.
