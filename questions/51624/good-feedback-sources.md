<p>Have you ever read "The Talent Code"? it makes an extensive investigation about what consistently works at raising talent. in this question I want to discuss how to improve our managerial and entrepreneurial skills.</p>

<p>I work as founding partner in a tech company. I work everyday leading people and helping to execute our tasks toward our vision (lots of hours every week), nonetheless, I feel I'm wasting my time because I haven't figured out a way to get professional feedback from my performance. Although I'm an avid reader of business literature.</p>

<h3>What sources of professional feedback do you use?</h3>
