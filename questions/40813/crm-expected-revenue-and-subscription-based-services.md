Many CRM applications include sales pipeline tracking and sales workflow. Generally, when a new opportunity is created, one has to somehow enter the 'expected revenue' for the deal. This is easy for product and one-off service sales, it is simply the total of all products and services for the deal.

The question I have concerns subscription based services. When selling something that has a monthly recurring revenue, what value should be entered as the 'expected revenue' for the opportunity? Is it the revenue for one month, one year, or something else?

<p>Many CRM applications don't address subscription / recurring revenue models. Cohort analysis is a good metric to view - but a bit more than a simple "field" value. </p>

<p>If you need a rollup value, See <a href="http://lsvp.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/how-to-estimate-lifetime-value/" rel="nofollow">Estimating lifetime value of subscription models </a>  Also - there is an updated post on <a href="http://lsvp.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/how-to-estimate-lifetime-value-for-an-ecommerce-business-sample-cohort-analysis/" rel="nofollow">Estimating LV of an ecommerce company</a>.  </p>

<p>Do these work for you?</p>
