Can somebody give me some ideas how the TV Video industry works?

E.g. If I like a certain TV program which I would like to broadcast in a different country in a different language...what are the formalities and mainly who owns the rights? The producer or the TV sender? While I guess its the producer I just want to hear the facts/info.

What are the various ways the rights are managed?

Thanks.

You should refer to this document: http://www.scribd.com/doc/11050570/Negotiating-Film-and-Television-Agreements-Laurence-Kaye

Be aware that such negotiations are essentially out of reach of startups. They take forever, which is time your startup doesn't have. They are very costly, money that your startup doesn't have. And so on...

That being said, you can always be the exception. I don't mean to discourage you.

Its the producer that owns the copyright. In saying so the TV station gets a contractual agreement from the producer to air the programme (content) for a period of time. Sooo...in saying so what you have to do is get a hold of the Distributor of the programme. A Distributor is the guy that advertises the *content* to the TV station as the Producer doesnt have these contacts. Best short cut is find out the producer and approach him for the Distributors name or approach the tv station and ask their Aquisitions Officer for the details of the Distributor.
