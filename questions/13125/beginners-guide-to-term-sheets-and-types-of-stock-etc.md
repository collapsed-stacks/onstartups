I'm looking for some simple laymen's information about what I need to know regarding Term Sheets, types of shares (preferred vs. common) and distribution to partners and investors. A book, article, blog post, etc would be great.

I know there is a lot of info out there, but it seems like most of it presupposes a basic understanding of these things, which i don't have.

I am in the position where I am looking to bring on a marketing partner and soon some investors for my startup (conxt.com), and so need to figure this out sooner rather than later.

Thanks!

Eric
