I have an EIN for my business (sole proprietorship), but I am confused as to whether I use my name or my business name on 1099's that I send out and on the associated 1096.  Does anybody know?  I've called the IRS and gotten 2 different answers from 2 different people there.

How should anybody outside the IRS know, if even the IRS does not know :) 

Joke aside. Document when you called the IRS and preferable who you talked with and what answer you got. If you get both answers, I would think that you could do either, whatever you like better. If someone complains you can refer back to the answer you got which means you have done due diligence in the eyes of a reasonable person.

A sole proprietorship is not treated as a separate entity by the IRS, so you do need to use your name since YOU ARE your company when using a sole proprietorship.
