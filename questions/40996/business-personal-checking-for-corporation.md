Is it REQUIRED to have a Business Checking account for a Corporation, or is a SEPARATE 'personal' account (using the business EIN and Name) ok? Are there any benefits to choosing a 'business' account over a 'personal' ?

Corporations (at least in the US) are required to have a separate banking account. Not having a separate account will allow piercing the corporate veil and put your personal assets in jeopardy.

Banks will not open a "personal" account with an EIN as tax ID.
