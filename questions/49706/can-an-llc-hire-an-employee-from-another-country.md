Can an LLC hire an employee from another country? The LLC will be registered in Germany, and I want to hire someone from an Asian country.

I have Googled this, but have not found any links related to this topic.

Yes technically an LLC can hire someone in other countries however you will have to abide by the local labour laws in the employees country which means you will have to do research on the country you are looking to hire in. Depending on how large of a company you are you might want to investigate a local agency to handle the hiring and HR portions of having an employee in your target country. You might also want to review your local laws to see if there is any money transfer limits and other regulations that might hinder your ability to work with your remote employee. I have hired people in China and in the Philippines without many problems at all. Make sure to have regular meetings and that expectations are very clear. 

If you are just starting out try www.odesk.com to get your feet wet, make sure to hire someone with a lot of hours of experince and has mainly good reviews.

If you grow beyond what Odesk can provide I suggest getting someone you can trust with your life to live in the country you've outsourced too. You need someone on the ground to tell you truthfully what is going on.
