So let's make an example story:

I'm the founder and the only developer of a web startup. Currently there is no one else other than me in the company.

I've added a sales guy, wishing to give him dividend 20% of the profit as compensation.

The company type would be a C corporation.

Now, I need answers for the following questions:

 1. Will the sales guy get a 20% cut if i get funding?
 2. Does giving him %20 of dividend share, means i still have %100 of the company ownership?
 3. What happens if the company got acquired? ie. for the sales guy.
 4. In regular stock shares, I can hand him a stock certificate, but what about Dividend payments?
 5. is it a good idea to get him %4 of dividend + %16 of stock shares instead?
 6. Are stock shares alone unprofitable untill selling them?

Thank you in advance.

(not a laywer, not in the US)

Ok, I think your mixing a few concepts together (or I am) ...

 - **A share** is a "thing" you hold which reporesents a "bit" or fraction of a company.
 - **Dividend**. when companies make a profit (income - Expenses) they often pay a dividend on a percentage of that profit (the majoirty of the profit goes back into allowing the company to grow in the next year).
 - The dividend (at least in Australia) can be fully franked or on non-franked ... Franked pretty much means the tax has been paid by the company before handing over the money to the shareholder. Non-franked means the tax is the shareholders problem. 
 - You can have different classes of shares some which allow voting on company direction, some which pay dividends and some which don't.

So you can choose to pay dividends in a company at any point (typically yearly or quarterly), most startups don't pay dividends for the first 5 or 10 years because they are reinvesting every cent back into make the company grow.

**Now shareholding** ...

If your company has 100 shares, to make the math easy but its more likely to be 1 million shares or something easier to hand out small bits.

Your new sales person would be given 20% (20 shares) in your company, you by default hold the remaining 80% (or 80 shares). When you bring on investors you both give up some of your shares, normally in equal proportion ... you give 30% to a new investor, you give up 24 of your shares and the sales person gives up 6 of theirs. 

Ok now you have assigned shareholding you can pay dividends on the shares.

Imagine you make $100,000 profit and decide to pay 10% of that profit as dividends.
This means you have $10,000 to spread amoungst 100 shares therefore $100 per share. 

 - You have 56 shares thus you get $5600 of the $10,000
 - Your sales person gets $1400 
 - Your investor gets $3000.

The same happens the next year when you split $200,000 in profit.

**Voting rights**. Same as paying dividends, when it comes to decisions about direction of the company, when to sell out, replacing the CEO and senior staff, when to enter a new market etc the shareholders get together and vote on the direction ... its their money at stake. 

**On sale of the company**. When you sell the company each share is effectively bought from you at an agreed amount say $10,000 per share. You each get paid accordingly.

Does that help answer the question at all?

**Dividends are paid to the shareholders of the company** in direct proportion to their shareholding.  So for example, if you held 100% of the shares, you would receive 100% of the dividend.  Thus, in order to give your sales guy 20% of the dividend, you would also have to give him 20% of the company.  Clearly you don't want to do that.  Unless you want him to have some ownership of the company, you don't want to hand him shares (because shares == ownership).  

Shareholders make money either through dividends from company profits or by disposing (selling) the shares.  The latter can only really happen if the company is traded on a public stock exchange or is acquired by another company.
