I have a technology product that I've created and is ready to be ramped up for distribution. To get interest, funding and presales, kickstarter looks very attractive.

My problem is that the product would be B2B, where my company would distribute the product to businesses if they were interested.

Successful technology kickstarters I have seen all revolved around presales for a product for consumers from a business (B2C), instead of more philanthropic "backing".

This makes me concerned about

1) what incentives I would offer backers

2) how to have a successful campaign resulting in funding


thoughts?

Kickstarter recently started cutting back to their core business (more fan-oriented presales) so your doubts about B2B (which are much more transaction oriented) are valid. If you are not in a hurry, you could wait for the SEC guidelines for crowd-investing. Alternatively, go direct on your website by embedding a crowd-sourcing social-tainer and just cross promote via linked-in and other industry sites.
