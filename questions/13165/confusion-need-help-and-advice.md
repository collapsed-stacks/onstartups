I'm currently practicing (HTML, CSS, Javascript) in order to create my own website.
But the problem is, how to push my website forward, i mean make it popular and bring
great traffic to it?

I got some ideas for my website project, but don't know what are the best tools! What is
the best programming language to create web applications?


Thanks,

<p>Practicing HTML and CSS has nothing to do with making a site popular and "bring great traffic to it".</p>

<p>What information is presented THROUGH the HTML / CSS / server side language and whether such information is deemed of value to your target audience will greatly influence whether a site is popular or not.</p>

<p>Websites are not a Field of dreams "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams" rel="nofollow">If you build it, they will come</a>" sort of thing - they require some promotion to get attention. </p>

<p>Suggest that you spend some time learning about techniques to increase website traffic. Google is your friend here - here's a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Increase-Website-Traffic" rel="nofollow">link</a> to start you off.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>You definitely need to shift your focus from web site development to Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  That, along with social media (depending upon your product), are good ways to drive people to your site.</p>

The way to bring traffic to your website is to:

1. Create original, valuable content.
2. Do SEO on your content.

The tools you use to deliver your content are mostly irrelevant.

I may not be reading this correctly, but you have two different questions in your post:

*"What is the best programming language to create web applications?"*

There is no generally "best" language. But, if you are very new to the field, you probably want to pick a well-documented platform with a large, helpful community. This would mean a C#, Ruby or Python-based website.

*"how to...make it popular and bring great traffic to it?*

You need to learn about SEO in particular, and online marketing in general to know how to capitalize on those SEO techniques. There are a lot of basics you can do yourself that can help a little. 

Or, you need to hire the right SEO company to do this for you. Find a recommended company locally that you can visit, learn and have them guide you. This is especially true if you are not selling in a niche/undeserved market. If you are going against "incumbents", and esp if those incumbents are doing their own SEO work, you will find it pretty hard. 

Getting your SEO executing well for you can be a tricky beast.

Good luck in your exciting endeavors.
