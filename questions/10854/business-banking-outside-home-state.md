I am starting an internet service business, which I have registered the LLC in Wyoming. Although I reside in Illinois, I travel all the time for work and would like to maintain my Wyoming corporate tax status (no corporate income tax). I was thinking that I should try to find a business bank account outside of Illinois at the very least, and preferably an account in Wyoming.

Does anyone know of a bank that will allow me to open and conduct business via fax and email? I'd prefer to find one in Wyoming.

Thanks.

Have you looked into nationwide banks, like Bank of America? Surely they have at least one branch in Wyoming...and they'll have a ton of branches in Illinois. That way you'll be able to do business in both states, and any other place you may travel.

I know Wells Fargo do remote banking, I have a business account in Nevada and one in Delaware (which is still Wachovia) but I live in California.
