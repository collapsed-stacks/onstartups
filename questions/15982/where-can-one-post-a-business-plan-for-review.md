We would like to ask for help in reviewing our plan. Not for viability of the business model but rather for clarity in explaining the plan. Does this function exist on this site? If not does anyone know of a good resource they can share? Thank you

<p>I tend to disagree with Noah. I don't think this is the right site to get feedback on your business plan.</p>

<p>If you'd like your business plan reviewed, here are a few suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Find a <a href="http://www.score.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">SCORE</a> mentor.</strong> The SCORE website has a lot of small business resources. Try to get connected with one of their mentors. These are people that have successfully run businesses, and now volunteer their time to help people like us, that are just starting out. Your mentor can review your business plan. More importantly this is someone that will give you quality feedback. Asking for feedback from random people online will not get you the same quality results.</li>
<li><strong>Find a college professor.</strong> My preference would be to find a SCORE mentor. If you can't find one in your area, look for a college professor willing to give you a hand.</li>
<li><strong>Post it online.</strong> There are places online you can post your business plan and get feedback, but I don't think this site is one of them. I can't think of any at the moment, but they are out there. I'm sure someone here can answer that.</li>
</ol>

<p>Side note: I took a look at your website, and I found it hard to figure out what it is that your business does. It's not clearly stated on the homepage, and my first thought was that it had something to do with the stock market :-) But then after seeing the term OEM, I realized it wasn't stock related.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

I'm sure you could post your plan here and get some feedback. You could upload the plan to scribd or docstoc and then share the link.

If you use Business Plan Pro, you can submit your plan for a free review from a business plan consultant (disclaimer: I work for Palo Alto Software, makers of Business Plan Pro).

Other options are 
1) Connect with local entrepreneurs and see if you can find a mentor
2) Startuptodo.com

I have never seen a public review of a serious business plan. 
In my opinion business plans are overrated, and those that spend too much time writing a plan take away time from actually building their business.

A plan is a good tool for raising funding.  That is it.
Most VC and Angels i have met do not actually read these plans, and when they do, they always look for negatives.

I think you are better having a general map for your business, 
a general product roadmap, a general market report, and a general marketing plan.
General because all of this will and should change.
Agility is very important.

If you want to get feedback on a venture, ask people who are already successful to share 30 mins disucssing your idea.  Its better in a conversation.

If you want feedback, may I suggest taking an indirect route by asking an Enterprise Architect that has interest in your product idea? They are used to reviewing lots of ideas on a weekly basis. You can find several who will help on LinkedIn
