I found this very cool site that I thought I'd share with the community (I'm not affiliated with them)!

http://www.panabee.com/

It helps you word play and create fun domain names... but it hasn't been SUPER useful to me. 

Are there other websites out there that help you brainstorm or wordplay to create a good business name?

<p>Here are my current favorites in decreasing order.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.domainhole.com/" rel="nofollow">Domain Hole</a> - use Beta code "TWITTER" to get in (as of this writing).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.panabee.com/" rel="nofollow">Panabee</a> (which you mentioned)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.namestation.com/" rel="nofollow">Name Station</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bustaname.com/" rel="nofollow">Bust a Name</a> - takes a little getting used to, and is a bit painful to use, but can be valuable at getting you to think about connected ideas</li>
<li><a href="http://valuedrops.com/" rel="nofollow">Value Drops</a>, these guys update every day with quality domain names recently expired. </li>
<li><a href="http://domai.nr/" rel="nofollow">Domai.nr</a> helps you find creative url structures for that name you really, really want to use.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordoid.com/" rel="nofollow">Wordoid</a> helps you make up names. </li>
