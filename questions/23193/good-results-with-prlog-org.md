I'm looking to use PRLog.org, which seems to be a free press release service.  Does anyone have any experience with it- good or bad?

Thanks.

I used it once.  The site is well done and easy to use.  Provides the services as advertised and they don't spam me.

I think it was a waste of time though.  The PR is out on the interwebs, but I don't think anyone picked it up.  If you want a PR to be an effective tool, you need to do more than just post it via PRLog.org.
