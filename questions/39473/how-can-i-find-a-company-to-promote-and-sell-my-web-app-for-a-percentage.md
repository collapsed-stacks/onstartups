Let's say I have a startup web-app (e.g. ticketing system) ready to go live. I am planning to sell a monthly membership. I don't want to market/promote it, so I'd like to find a company to do that for me in exchange for a percentage of sales.

How can I go about finding such a company? I know companies like that must exist, but I don't know how to find them. I'm looking for advice on the discovery process.

So far I have found [digitalriver][1], and [clickbank][2]. Clickbank is for affiliates, and it's not an option for me.

You need to do it yourself first, to find out how the market for your service works. Hire a sales guy to help you, someone with experience selling in your field. Once you've demonstrated there's value for your service and there's a profitable distribution channel, you'll find people to join you, easily.

**Entrepreneurship is about solving two problems: 1) creating something valuable, 2) getting it out there.** For now, you're still in the "creating something" phase; still need to demonstrate it's valuable (need few businesses that use your service regularly) and work out phase 2.

Good luck.

You should start by putting it live first!

Then you create an attractive lead into why people would want to use it.

Perhaps add a pretty video of you using it so that potential customers will be pulled into wanting to try it out themselves.

Then opt them into an account and let them provide feedback so that you can see what the pitfalls of you web-app are.

After all this you will have a few users and you grow it from there.
