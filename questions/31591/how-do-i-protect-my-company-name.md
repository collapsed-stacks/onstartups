I have business I want to start online. I already have the domain name and very soon the logo. I want to offer this services to anyone online.

So what is the best way to protect the name of my company and the logo?

Where should I go to buy the trademark?

Also is there anything else I need to know when I go international with an online business?

You will need to register the trademark with whatever country you are doing business in (Both the wordmark, and the logo) to protect it there. If you wish to protect it in any other countries your business is selling to, then you will have to get a trademark from each individual country. There should be quite a bit of information on www.wipo.org This is the website for the World Intellectual Property Organization, which is sort-of a shoot off of the UN, but not exactly (Though it is just across the street).

<p>In the U.S., particularly Pennsylvania where I live, there were a few things I found when looking into this. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.corporations.state.pa.us/corp/soskb/csearch.asp" rel="nofollow">Corporation Search</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.legalzoom.com/llc-state-requirements/pennsylvania-llc.html" rel="nofollow">Pennsylvania LLC Name</a> (Scroll to the names section)</li>
</ul>

<p>So now when I search in that "Corporation Search" database for ClosedReq, it shows up on a government website that my company operates under that name and when it was established. Hopefully that falls under your definition of "protected". </p>
