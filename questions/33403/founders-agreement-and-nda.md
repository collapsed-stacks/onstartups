I am about to prepare a founders agreement to be signed by the founding team. Now, once we have the founders agreement, do we still need the NDA for each founders?

The founder's agreement should contain the equivalent of an NDA rather than it being a separate document.  An NDA is generally used when there is not another agreement in place, eg, where two companies want to discuss a potential business deal.  For example, when you hire an employee, the employment contract has confidentiality provisions and you don't ask the employee to sign a separate NDA.
