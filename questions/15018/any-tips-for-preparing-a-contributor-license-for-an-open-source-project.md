In spite of some of the advice on Answers.OnStartups, I've recently open-sourced a library I wrote for a vertical niche (http://atdl4net.org/ if anyone is interested, although it isn't too relevant to the question).  I understand that if you want to allow people to contribute and subsequently be able to include their contributions in the offering, then you need a **contributor license**.

Does anyone have an tips for preparing a contributor license? - things to make sure you include, pitfalls to be wary of, etc?  Even pointers to some good examples would be a help (or for that matter, known bad examples).

Thanks in advance - Steve.

(In case anyone's wondering, the motivation for open-sourcing the library is slightly involved, but one reason is to encourage adoption of the industry standard that it implements, as my business model is built around increasing usage.)

<p>The <a href="http://oss.oracle.com/oca.pdf" rel="nofollow">Oracle/Sun contributor agreement</a> for MySQL contributions is a good start:</p>

<p>You may find similar documents in most commercial backed open source projects.</p>

<p>Following a little bit more research, I came across the following article:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://opensource.com/law/10/9/copyright-aggregation" rel="nofollow">http://opensource.com/law/10/9/copyright-aggregation</a></strong> - it seems that this is a common problem for firms working in the open source space, and there is a strong desire to standardize the whole area of contributor agreements.</p>
