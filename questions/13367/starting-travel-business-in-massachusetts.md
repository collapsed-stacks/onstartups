I currently run a home based travel agnecy in WA state, and will be moving to MA next year. I looked around the MA gov't website to try and find out what I need to transfer my company, but it's very confusing.

Anyone know what the general liscense requirements are (fees, forms, links to websites, etc), and if there are special licenses I'd need as a "Seller of Travel"?

Thank you in advance for any and all help.

Because each state has different corporate laws, speaking with an attorney licensed in Massachusetts is necessary. Many states, though, allow businesses chartered in a different jurisdiction to also register as a foreign entity in that state, avoiding the need to dissolve a business in one state and re-establish that same business in a different state and face potential tax consequences.  However, even if a business registers as a foreign entity in a new state, the laws of that new state may pose additional requirements, including, special licensing or trademark/tradename registration in the new state. The Secretary of State of Massachusetts can provide the requisite forms and fee information for registering as a foreign entity in Massachusetts.

Importantly, only an attorney licensed in Massachusetts is capable of confirming whether or not merely registering as a foreign entity in Massachusetts is sufficient.  As with all corporate issues, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.
