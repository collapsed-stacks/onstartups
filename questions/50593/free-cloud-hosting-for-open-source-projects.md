In around 3 months I'll be open-sourcing (BSD or LGPL) + launching my niche social platform—with web-app and mobile app frontends—built to scale.

I am building it using Python and postgres; but would definitely like to consider more interesting NoSQL solutions such as Neo4j.

As I recall, a few cloud providers offer free hosting for open source Startups.

Can you help me find a reliable one?
