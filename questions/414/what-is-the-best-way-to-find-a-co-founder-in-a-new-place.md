I have been living in MN for the last 4 years. I am not from the US. I give this background to show that my close friends are not from here, so I cannot approach them to be my co-founders. I have close friends from MN, but none of them are interested in working in a startup and none of them have the technical background needed for my startup. I want to start a company which includes building websites and mobile apps. 

I do not know how to go about finding someone whom I can trust. I know I can go through startuply.com, linkedin.com, etc., but how do I know that I can trust them?

Start alone. Someone will join you in case of visible success on a horizon.

Networking!

I'd recommmend:

 - Get involved with the local tech community
 - Attend conferences and workshops
 - Attend or start a StartupDrinks event
 - Start a blog, start following people on twitter, comment on other local blogs

How do you know you can trust them?

 - You could get to know them before starting a company with them
 - How do they know they could trust you?  If you're both coming from a similar financial position then you might both be in the same boat and have to trust each other
 - Use LinkedIn or networking to find someone you know in common, or find someone you could trust who might recommend/refer someone

You can never trust anyone. 
Why do you need a cofounder? 
If you have the money, start hiring. 
If you dont, earn the money first.
