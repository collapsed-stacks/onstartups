I run my online social networking business from my home in Arizona but my mailing address is in California... Which state's laws for business do I have to uphold? Arizona or California?

You will have to uphold the laws of the state you are incorporate in. The corporation is a legal entity separate from you so if it is incorporated in California think of it as the company lives in california and therefore subject to their laws.

You are a worker who happens to work in a home based office in Arizona. You are subject to Arizona law when it comes to your personal actions and filing personal taxes and so on.
