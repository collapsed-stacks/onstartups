A friend of ours recently was looking at opening a liquor store, which obviously required liquor license and to be able fit into a county quotas, etc.

But this brought a different question, if I am opening a business of any sort: restaurant, bar, liquor store, medical supply company, etc.  I might require licenses of various sorts to be able to do so.

Is there a single place where I can find what licenses would be required to open a particular type of business?

I am located in the state of Pennsylvania in the US, but the question and location is not limited to that locality.

The laws differ from state to state and municipality to municipality.  The main places to look at are (1) your state's department of commerce, (2) your municipality's business licensing department.
