I'm a 3d software developer working for a manufacturing company on industrial visualization software programs. In the future, I wish to develop 2d/3d games, mapping applications during my free time. 

Given relevant company policies and forms I signed, I wish to know who will own the result IP I develop? (Assuming no work/non-work software program copyright infringement)

In my Employee Handbook:

 1. prohibited from secondary employment that compete, trades, or
    sells/buys with company business. 
 2. prohibited from secondary employment that interferes with employee
    obligations/performance. 
 3. Must obtain approval for independent consulting/contracting.
 4. Employee can't work on secondary employment project during primary
            employment hours and facilities.

Forms I signed:

 - An acknowledgement form stating that the Employee Handbook isn't
   legally binding or a contract except the section about arbitration.
 - A Confidentiality Agreement preventing disclosure of company trade
   secrets, do not bring third party's secrets into company premise, do
   not pirate, etc..
 - An Ethical Conduct policy that essentially mirrors the four points in
   the Employee Handbook.

Hence there is no explicit form stating that all IP/ideas I developed during the course of employment (day and night) are to belong to the company I work for. While this seems to be in my favor, I was also told it's not.

I am a full time, exempt employee working in California for an out of state company.

<p><a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2870-2872" rel="nofollow">CA Labor Code Section 2870(a)</a> says, generally, that inventions developed entirely on the employee’s own time without using the company’s equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secrets, and that do not relate to or result from the employer's business or anticipated R&amp;D belong to the employee.</p>

<p>If this matter is important enough, you should ask a lawyer to review the facts and applicable documents and render an opinion</p>

Since your employer is from out of state, the California moonlighting provisions Dana cited may or may not apply to you. For an empirical case and outcome, see:

I completely agree with @Gary E, but there is a 90% chance that if you're looking at something along the same lines, especially if you're using skills the company provides, that they will try to own it.  Especially if it's successful.  Talk to an attorney with your specific documents, and they can answer your question.  Sometimes, depending on the company, you can amend these documents with exclusions.  Also watch out for clauses that state that the company owns all works published x months after employment.
