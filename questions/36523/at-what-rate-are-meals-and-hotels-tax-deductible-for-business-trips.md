I"m going to a conference and wondering if meals and hotels are 100% tax deductible.

My accounting person is pretty sure meals are at 50% deductible  and wasn't sure about hotels.
So if I spent $100 on meals, I could claim $50 as an expense. On hotels, she's not sure.

Any reference links would be great.

<p>I <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc511.html" rel="nofollow">found it</a> myself:</p>

<p>Meals : 50%
It looks like hotels would be at 100%.</p>
