I created an unverified PayPal account. However, I was able to send a money request email to my wife and there, the big **Pay Now** button exist and seems to work. Is it possible to get money from other people with an unverified PayPal account?

Yes as long as it's below your account limit, verification places limits on the amount you can send and receive. To check your limites (varies by country) login to Paypal and just underneath your name is an accounts limit link.

I have a problem with my paypal account and no one seems to be able to deposit on my account.  You have to make sure that the account can receive money, I guess you have to ask the user for that. 

Paypal throws accounts with limits if they find some weird login activity as what they reasoned out with me.  Now they are requiring me to present a lot of verification like statement of bills and even a trial charge on my bank account.
