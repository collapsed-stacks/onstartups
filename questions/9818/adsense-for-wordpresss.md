We are using adsense plugin for our blog http://www.skill-guru.com/blog/
This plugin is not very good and I do not see much better options. 
At the end of the blog, I want to display the ad . Should I go for my own programming or there are better options available ?

<p>AdSense is well known to be <em>terrible</em> at generating revenue.  Even StackOverflow barely made money with it; neither did blogging greats like CopyBlogger or ProBlogger.</p>

<p>Go with an ad network.  The one we're using on this site is <a href="http://influads.com/" rel="nofollow">Influads</a> -- check them out.  It's a teeny company so the service is terrific and they're reasonable about rates.</p>

I don't know about wordpress, but I've set-up Adsense for my Joomla site http://www.cleverandeasy.com/. Instead of using a plugin, I simply took the adsense code and copied it into an article. This article, I can insert wherever I want in another article to display an ad block.

Was a piece of cake, no plugin, no programming required.
