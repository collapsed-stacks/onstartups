Would it be wise to bring our Angel to the VC-pitch?

The Angel would make a good impression. He is definetely better at pitching than everyone in the team.

But what impression would it make, if we bring our "big daddy" to hold hands during the pitch? 

The BA only has a minor stake in the business, somewhere around 5%.

Only if they are part of your team or will make an introduction. Even then, it's best to have the team do the pitching.

Your team has to get good at pitching. Your commitment, enthusiasm, passion and competence needs to shine through. 

Have your angel help you pitch better. After all, it's in their best interest to make you successful.

Investors want a team that can get the job done and make a return on their investment. If the founding team can't pitch them, it's a non-starter.
