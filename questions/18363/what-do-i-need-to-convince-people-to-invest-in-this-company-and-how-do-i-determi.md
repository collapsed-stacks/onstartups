I am planning for a company. The company will build a university. The company has a plan of 10 years to build the university and make it functional.

What I need now is investment. The question is how to convince people to invest in the company without sharing all the detailed plans of the university project?

How much should the initial investment for the university project be?

You can not. Seriously. THis plan sound very unrealistic to start with.

Seriously? 10 years no payout and revenue. If the rest of the plan is as good, dont even try finding investors.

> investment for the university project
> could be?

YOU TELL US. Seriously. It is your plan. If you dont even have an idea what investments you need, you dont have a plan at all, just an idea, and it sounds VERY ridiculous at this moment.

Without any knowledge of the country where you are operating, your background and connections, I'm sorry to say your question seems to be naive.

Anyway, there's **no way** you can convince people "to invest in the company without sharing all the detailed plan of the university project". Investors invest in a plan, you can't ask money without explaining what you are going to do with them (unless, of course, you are already a very successful entrepreneur or the investors are your personal friends).

As for the initial investment, it needs to be at least the amount of money you need to build the university before it becomes profitable. Salaries, office spaces, infrastructure, bills.

You need three things to convince people to invest in your idea:

- Executive Summary
- A Pitch
- A Financial Model

###Executive Summary###
This explains your idea and company crisply in under two pages, including what you want to build and how you will build it. It also includes the amount of money required and what that money will be used for.

###The Pitch###
The pitch is the high level summary of your business plan. It must contain enough details to entice people to want to continue on to the next meeting. Without a solid pitch, that details your idea and how it will happen, you will not get any traction with investors.

###Financial Model###
Your financials need to be modeled so that it's clear what the investment will be used for and when you will make money. All an investor really cares about is how much money you need to exit so he can get his investment back.

Both NetTecture and Filippo are right on when they say you need to disclose your idea and share the details. That's just how you have to do it in order for people to invest. You may ask them to sign an NDA but that will only work with some investors -- US VC's will never sign an NDA.

<p>Start by building your <strong>business plan</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the most important task in the <strong>market study</strong>.</p>

<p>This will helps you figure out most the questions you still have. And questions (all) investors will ask...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To convince an investor to give you lot of money, you have to prove you will make him gazillionaire ;)</p>

<p>You will have to work on your presentation. I liked the book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0978577604" rel="nofollow">Even a Geek Can Speak</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

It is actually surprisingly easy:

Step 1. Decide the profit and assets you want in year 10

Step 2. Figure out your expenses and taxes for the next 10 years

Step 3. Figure out your revenue for the next 10 years.


Your initial investment will be $Step 3 - $Step 2 - $Step 1.  But surely you have already done that in that business plan, right? Or is it a how-to-get-moon-rock style plan - go to moon, pick up a rock, come back. Investors want numbers and details, not ideas. 

To all the nay-sayers, just remember the story that the guy that started Fedex wrote the business plan as a college assignment and the professor failed him because it was 'impossible to do'.

There is answers to all your questions but only it you re-evaluate your idea.
Its a good idea and it can be done with good understanding of all the requirement.The reason why I say its possible is, With my mind I have done the feasibility study and the results are positive. You need to do more research about this, do your viability study. 
NB.There is noway you can convince investors without knowing what you talking about, Investors are interested in making money. Be careful.

I can read a lot of negativity in replies to this question. Why would you call this guy's plan naive? I personally wouldn't call it naive, rather put it into the some kind of perspective.

His plan is:

Hard to do? Yes
Requires big sums of money? Yes
Impossible to do? No

I would maybe suggest drop your big plans for the time being. Try to grow organically. If your an qualified educator and you have more partners with the same skill, establish a small "teaching institute" - an evening school type. Get people in your classes, show that you can offer quality education and work your way up. Step by step work on your accreditation and start that online platform your talking about. Grow organically.

To be honest I don't think establishing even a small size university with all the campuses, lectures etc. is likely in just 10 years. Not without a huge grant or significant investments from your personal fund. Starting small with 1 classroom and growing step by step would my advice here.
