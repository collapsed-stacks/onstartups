A few people have suggested in different answers and on a couple of different blog posts I've read recently that it is a good idea to put your beta site on Hacker News, [for example][1]:

> If you have a product in beta, post something on HackerNews to let
> them test it out before anyone else. They love that.

I've already had a look around HN a few times and I'm not sure where on the site I should be doing this. I don't want to tread on any toes and want to make sure I get it right the first time, can someone provide me information on the right approach for doing this?

You need to create a new post (http://news.ycombinator.com/submit), best to begin the title with "Ask HN:" then ask for site review etc.

What worked well for me was to put a good description of my background as well as the problems I was trying to solve with my site.
