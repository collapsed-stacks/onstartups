I have seen many website which create flash banner ads online and you can directly download the customized flash banner, thought it is not a new business idea I feel I can add some unique feature to this business

But on the second thought I want to know if this idea is worth putting time and money, for that I need to know the market size of online flash banner ad sales and aprox estimated revenue of present players in the market. I tried to google for a long time to find the answer to it but was unable to do so.

It would be really great if someone here could give some guidance regarding how to find the market size, estimated sales etc. for flash banner ad business. Thanks in advance

Sizing market demand can difficult for certain niches. Especially if people aren't really searching for it or if people aren't aware of the ultimate value proposition. For example, I doubt anyone was searching "social network website" or "140 character limited post" before Facebook and Twitter.

A good place to start is the Google's Keyword Search Tool:

 - https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal

It'll break down specific keywords for you.

A search on "flash banner" produces 301,000 global monthly searches.

Now if you think you can capture and monetize on even a .1%, that's 300 potential monthly clients.

I like what Will said but in Google itself I find "flash banner" WITH QUOTES results in About 7,670,000 results.

If you found sites doing that which are also selling advertising, could be a bad indicator. 

But I don't understand if your business is for consumers or web designers. I'd think that entry level web designers resorting to WordPress would be a good target to consider.
