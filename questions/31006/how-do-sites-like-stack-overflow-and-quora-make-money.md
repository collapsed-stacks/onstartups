Stack Overflow and all its sites are great, but how do they make money? There is just one ad on a page in the best case on Stack Overflow, and none on Quora or OnStartups.com. Am I missing something, or do these sites hardly make any money at all?

<p>In the case of Stack Overflow, users under 200 rep (and by extension anyone not logged in) sees more adverts. SO gets a huge number of page views from search engines and the majority of those will be new, unregistered users.</p>

<p>With the traffic SO gets, it's incredibly easy to make a lot of money, even via Google Adsense. But SO makes more money by selling its ad space directly. Jeff Atwood has a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/how-to-advertise-on-your-blog-without-completely-selling-out.html">great post on the matter</a>.</p>

<p>SO also makes money through its careers service and job postings.</p>

<p>Everyone has a different pricing model. Websites like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora" rel="nofollow">Quora</a>, Twitter, and Stack&nbsp;Overflow starts as free websites and get funded from donations or venture capitalists or some are present there for promote the parent company.</p>

<p>You can take the example of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShareThis" rel="nofollow">ShareThis</a></em> sharing buttons which is made only for promothing the parent company. Similary, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_%28service%29" rel="nofollow">blogger.com</a> is used to promote Google. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_%28website%29" rel="nofollow">Delicious</a> to Yahoo, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebo" rel="nofollow">Bebo</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" rel="nofollow">AOL</a> and lots more. </p>
