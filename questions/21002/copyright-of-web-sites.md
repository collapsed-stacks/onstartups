If I wanted to make a website similar to an existing one, how do I know that I'm not breaking its copyright? 

For example, how do I find this out for a website such as Facebook?

Graphic design is considered as intellectual property and is *automatically protected by copyright*.

You can't just "copy" a design. However, creating a new one inspired by another one is perfectly legal (with some limitations).

In short:

- Copy/pasted design => **not allowed**
- New design inspired by an existing one => **allowed with limitations**

The biggest rule about inspiration is that the new design can't be confused with the existing one.

Want to create a logo with an apple in it? No problem, but the vast majority of the people must not confuse your logo with Apple Inc logo.

You can create a slim blue design that remind the feeling of Facebook, but your users must not believe they are on facebook or that you are affiliated with them.

**This discussion is confused.**

The form of intellectual property (IP) that is called "copyright" generally covers "works of authorship". Examples are books, music lyrics, photos, longer texts on a webpage, etc.

The IP that is most often used for logos and brand elements would be "trademarks". Examples are registered trademarks for the Nike 'Swoosh' logo, Apple's logo, some corporate slogans, etc.

Lastly, there is a common form of IP called "patents", which in some countries can cover any *innovation* that is deemed sufficiently novel -- and in other countries patents are more restricted in scope.

A design in its abstract form -- what is known as "look and feel" -- the colors used, the position of main elements, etc -- generally **cannot be legally protected**.

A very specific *design element* (such as a logo) or an *innovation* (such as a way of interacting with a user interface which no-one else has ever thought of) will often be legally protected.

**Thus:**

 1. If you're making a new website similar in *function*, but different in *visual appearance* from existing competitors, you generally don't have to worry about copyright. You might need to worry about patents.
 2. If you're making a new website so similar in appearance (overall, or in smaller details such as a logo) that it can reasonably be confused with another company's, then you're on dangerous ground. You might be judged as infringing on trademarks, or impersonating.


 - In both cases above, you must not infringe on trademarks.

 - In both cases above, you must make the website work from the ground up -- i.e. not copy'n'paste from someone else.

> how do I find this out for a website such as Facebook?

First, go read Facebook's legal pages, where they will almost certainly indicate which logos etc are trademarked, and provide some "terms of use" or similar which cover their webpages, data, etc. If you feel that you're doing something that is high-risk, then go see a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property laws.

"Graphic design is considered as intellectual property"

True...to a degree... but a layout isn't graphic design, just the elements are. A shape is generic, public domain, just like these words.
