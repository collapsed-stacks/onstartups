When launching a new product, I find that my team and I get nervous when trying to decide what sort of price tag to put on it. Just for the sake of example, we have no access to any sort of funding; we develop Wordpress Plugins and miscellaneous scripts in the internet marketing niche.

Some things we've tried to take into consideration are the following:

 - How long did it take to develop said product
 - Approximately how many customers do we expect to have (estimated through market/niche research and different advertising mediums)
 - The cost of similar products in a particular niche
 - How much risk we're willing to take
 - What does our "gut feeling" says

Is there a formal model that has been developed already?

<p>Pricing is always a challenge - and there is a ton of advice on the web to review. </p>

<p>Many focus on what value the prospective customer receives, and what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring" rel="nofollow">pricing anchor</a> they would compare it to. Its up to you to understand what is valuable and whether the appropriate anchor is referenced (example: if someone believes that websites are something that the teenager next door can whip together in 10 minutes, you're unlikely to sell them a solution @ $5000) </p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/28/youre-pricing-it-wrong-software-pricing-demystified/" rel="nofollow">good article</a> to review - lots of relevant links.  In addition, priceintelligently has a free ebook "<a href="http://www.priceintelligently.com/" rel="nofollow">developing your pricing strategy</a>" that is a good read. </p>
