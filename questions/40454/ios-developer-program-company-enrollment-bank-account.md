I would like to enroll for Apple iOS development. I am also planning to start a company for this.

My question is that, how Apple will going to pay my earnings from Appstore? 

 1. Must I open a bank account on behalf of the company or can I have
    Apple transfer the earnings to my individual account?  
 2. Must I provide a bank account where the company is located or can I
    have Apple transfer the earnings to some other country bank account?

It is required to provide bank account for AppStore, iAd
With Apple you can change bank account from one bank to another even if banks country is in different country.
Be aware that you sign contract with Apple and Apple pays you or your company.

*Your bank may ask for the contract as well.*

When you enter bank account number, Apple does not know if that account if your personal, business, etc. Especially because of different rules in different countries.

If you will ask Apple they will tell you that your should not violate contracts and agreements. It is your responsibility to enter correct bank account.

When the month is over it takes +- 30 days to get the payment.

But you have to make at least $150 as total from all regional sales.
