So I have a brand new startup company that provides valuable resources to a variety of consumers in the college application/admission process, what I want to know is, how can I approach a college or organization, ask them to use my service in exchange for continued free use of the service, without sounding scamy or off-putting. When making a pitch, how can I pitch to organizations organically?

Do it HONESTLY.  Seriously, just do it honestly.  Call up the prospect, and tell them who you are and what you are doing.  Tell them you have this idea that you've been working on, and you are just starting to look for colleges who can try it out.  Tell them you are looking for some ADVICE and SUGGESTIONS.  

Let them know that it probably still needs some work.  Let them know all the problems and challenges you have. 

Don't worry about polishing your pitch.  The less polished you sound, the more they will be willing to help you.  

This approach won't work for all types of sales, but it is like a secret weapon early on in the Start-Up process.  Everybody wants to give ADVICE and SUGGESTIONS.

Good luck
