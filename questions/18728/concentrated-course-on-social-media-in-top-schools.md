Are there any top or mid level schools that offer an MBA degree with a concentration on Social Media, SEO, etc.? 
I would like to also know whether theses concentrated courses would also include learning about API usage for the sites, and the use of analytics from the data accumalated, as well as designing winning strategies for social media for businesses. 

Most of the courses seem to be online or from really non descript schools, and I would like to get information on schools providing a structured learning of social media techniques along with the broader business coursework.

MarketMotive is online, but several brick-and-mortar universities are licensing their content.

I'm not aware of a whole focus that is accredited only classes.  It would likely be an MBA with a marketing focus.

I think that the few who really got the "social media" thing right are now multi-millionaires, and probably won't spend more than 2 hours teaching MBA students, and even if they do you probably will find their speech online.

Why go to an MBA? Why not start a business / social media service instead?

I am a fan of Jim Rogers (ex-associate of George Soros in the Quantum fund) and he always advise people to skip the MBA and start a company.

Emerson College in Boston has a Social Media Course taught by David Gerzof ( @davidgerzof ).  It was just covered in a Wall Street Journal article.

Many of his students have landed very good jobs with major corporations and even some political campaigns.

<p>Books that I've read that were good are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The News Rules of PR and Marketing (basic)</li>
<li>Inbound Marketing (more advanced)</li>
<li>Tribes (ra-ra type of book and takes about 2 hours)</li>
</ul>

<p>And who needs a formal course when you have the internet? You should check out <a href="http://www.udemy.com/search?q=social+media" rel="nofollow">Udemy courses</a> on social media.</p>
