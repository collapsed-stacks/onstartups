One of our customers recently informed us of the following:

> "In accordance with the California
> Franchise Tax Board, Publication 1017
> and Revenue and Taxation Code Section
> 18662, we are required to withhold 7%
> from all payments made to
> non-California service providers for
> services rendered or rents paid.

We are not exempt (the only exemption is if you file a California Tax Return, which we do not). 

California is probably the most aggressive state when it comes to out of state business and I'm not sure of the best course of action.

 1. Does this apply only to California government and state institutions?
 2. Are we legally allowed to charge a 7% surcharge to California businesses?

You don't want an answer from users on this forum. Uncle Sam takes his income seriously. Taxes need accurate information. Call tax office of the state where you are located.

<p>I found this info when looking at the <a href="http://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2009/09_1017.pdf" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there exceptions to withholding?</p>
  
  <p>Yes. Withholding is not required if
  one of the  following exceptions is
  met:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The individual, S corporation
  shareholder, or  partner is a
  California resident.</li>
  <li>The payee meets
  one of the exemptions on  Form 590,
  Withholding Exemption Certificate.</li>
  <li>The total payments or distributions of
  California  source income to the
  nonresident are equal to or  less than
  $1,500 for the calendar year.</li>
  <li>The
  payment is for goods.</li>
  <li>The services
  provided by the nonresident are not 
  performed in California.</li>
  <li>The
  nonresident payee or the withholding
  agent  receives written authorization
  from us waiving the  withholding. </li>
  <li>The payments are income from
  intangible  personal property, such as
  interest and  dividends, unless the
  property has acquired a  business
  situs in this state. </li>
  <li>The payments
  are compensation from a motor  carrier
  providing transportation in two or
  more  states, subject to section
  11504(b) of title 49 of  the United
  States Code.  </li>
  <li>The payments are wages
  paid to employees.  For information on
  employee wage withholding,  contact
  California Employment Development 
  Department. </li>
  <li>The payee is a bank or
  banking association. </li>
  <li>The payments
  are made to a nonresident  corporate
  director for director’s services. </li>
  <li>The distribution is exempt income.</li>
  <li>The partner has certified that the
  income was  previously reported on the
  partner’s California tax  return.</li>
  </ul>
