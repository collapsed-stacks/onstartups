Are there some sites that would contain good reliable definitions for the buzz words used in the marketing / affiliates business?
<BR>
For instance:<BR>
Contextual: Contextual advertising is a form of targeted advertising for advertisements appearing on
websites or other media, such as content displayed in mobile browsers. The advertisements
themselves are selected and served by automated systems based on the content displayed to the user.
<BR><B>Edit</B>
This is one of the very few words that I did find. I'm looking for definitions specific to that business that have multiple definitions.
