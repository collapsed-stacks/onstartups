Very serious about starting a small business. 

Recently have been introduced to the major U.S. small business category: [Disadvantaged Businesses][1] 

Looking further - a company comprised of 51% or more of [socially disadvantaged individuals][2].

I am a minority listed in the socially disadvantaged page but I never thought of myself as disadvantaged.

Why am I called disadvantaged and should I register as one ?

Any point in the right direction is greatly appreciated..

Thank You!

There are federal and state mandates to allocate certain percentage of contracts to mentioned type of businesses. If you fit the criteria, you should register. Also, if you are subcontracting with companies working on federal or state contract, this registration also will benefit you. Those large corporations are also required to allocate portion of the contract too.
