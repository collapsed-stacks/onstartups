We are looking at developing a new product but want to get the market research right first up.

It's a time keeping application with some secret sauce.

We have brain stormed a range of vertical markets, taken educated guesses at what features they may want but we realize we are simply starting to make IT up. 

I know this is where most tech based startups get to before going.back to the fun bit of building it.

So to start with, what are the key considerations/next steps we should take before diving into the coding side again?

Here are some ideas for how you can conduct some market research:

- Put up some Google Adwords on Google and track leads. 

  Gather information from these leads in a contact form and speak with them directly to gather more information about what kinds of problems your up and coming product could solve.

- Build a prototype that highlights the features you believe separate you from the competition. Put it out there as a free beta product and see how your potential customers use it.

 The goal is to get it out there fast. It should work reasonably well and be free of major bugs, but don't try to focus on every single feature. The goal of the prototype is to see if there is interest in your product.

 Find friends or other colleagues to use your product to help get feedback.


These ideas are things you can do quickly, without investing a lot of time and money. The results will help you either refine your ideas or decide to call it quits.

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/" rel="nofollow">Google insight</a>  and trends is a worthwhile tool to check and verify atleast a part of your ideas before you spend money on market research.</p>

<p>If a product is not searched, then I think in majority of the cases it is not required for the market.</p>
