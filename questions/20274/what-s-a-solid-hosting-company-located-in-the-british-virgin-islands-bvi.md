As a quick prologue: a client is setting up a corporation in the BVI for tax / legal purposes.


Due to this, I'm currently searching for a hosting company located in BVI to run their website from. I have been searching around a lot, but so far, haven't been able to come up with anything. Does anyone out there know of any hosting companies located in BVI that I could contact?

_Please keep the answers related to possible hosting solutions and not the potential problems or horror stories of hosting overseas._

Thanks you in advance!

I'm been through most of BVI, there isn't much there for Internet infrastructure.  

Tortola would be the only island that you'd have much hope of finding something on, and I've been there at times when Internet access was out on the entire island.

Your best bet would be to go to the Cable and Wireless office on Tortola and talk to them about possible server colocation.

I doubt if you will find a web host there. Even if you do. It'll be very expensive.

A way to do this if there was no host would be to start your own. (leased line, server, and support etc).
