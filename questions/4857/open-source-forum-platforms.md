I have need for a Facebook type application that can be extended to present news and then encourage community members to comment on it.

Could anyone recommend a platform, ideally not PHP based? Is Open Social as bad as Wikipedia makes it appear!) EssentiaESP looks interesting, but information about the tech architecture is well hidden.

Thanks,
Puk

> ideally not PHP based

I think we need some clarification on this point.  Is it that you don't like PHP?  Don't have server that runs it?

You could create a Ning network. See: http://www.ning.com/what-is-ning/

If you pay something like $49 monthly, then you'll get it with no ads and you can put it on your own domain.

I was going to recommend Drupal, but that's PHP based. I'd highly recommend talking about this with your partner. This issue isn't so much what your partner likes, but where you can find talent for a reasonable pay. PHP is a widely used language, that runs on most platforms, that a lot of people know.

Your co-founder is right - PHP is terrible, and to maintain a web app you need to learn PHP *and* JavaScript.

Look at [Meteor](http://meteor.com), and at the [Telescope](http://telesc.pe/) platform - a Reddit clone written entirely in JavaScript.
