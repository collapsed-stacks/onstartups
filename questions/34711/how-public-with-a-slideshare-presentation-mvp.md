My MVP is going to be a PPT presentation uploaded to slideshare which i could then share by email, im also going to be putting up a landing page which will be a wordpress theme that i have already chosen.

Would you embed a slideshare presentation on the landing page directly or would you keep it off the landing page?

It will be a problem presentation, possibly between 10 - 20 slides.

<p>You may use a slide deck to present the problem in 1 or 2 slides and than present a prototype of the solution. It could be a very nice MVP indeed.</p>

<p>I would recommend the templates at <a href="http://keynotopia.com/" rel="nofollow">Keynotopia</a> and something like this MVP case described here: <a href="http://keynotopia.com/sam-ovens-keynotopia/" rel="nofollow">How Sam Ovens Signed Up Dozens Of Paying Users Before Building His Product</a></p>
