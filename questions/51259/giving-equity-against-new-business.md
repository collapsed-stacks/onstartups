<p>I started a company in India in June of 2012 focusing on Web &amp; Mobile App Outsourcing Space. In past 1 year we have grown to revenue of $1M+ and we are expanding fast. The company is bootstrapped and I am its sole share holder. Currently, our profit margin is around 20%. The company is growing fast and this financial year we should be doing a minimum of $1.5M in revenues. </p>

<p>I in now in negotiations with a US based company with Fortune 500 clientele. We are negotiating a deal which will be around $1M. The client is saying that he needs an equity within the company in order award us this contract.  </p>

<p>Our profit margin on this new deal will be same i.e around 20% and I dont know how to structure this or, whether is this even a good idea at all.</p>

<p>Please advise.  </p>

<p>It sounds like you are negotiating with some type of software development firm that is trying to outsource their development to you for a $1 million contract.</p>

<p>They probably want equity so that they can have some type of control over your company, which will reduce risks.</p>

<p>If you are billing them your normal rates for that $1 million, then them asking for equity simply sounds like they are getting free equity for work they are paying for.</p>

<p>There are many ways to value your company, and you should do so (keeping your growth rate in mind) and then make a counter-offer, this time including some X amount of money for a portion of equity in the company. HOWEVER, before doing that, I would first query what is the prime purpose for this company wanting equity in your business. As I said above, it could be to reduce risk, but then again, it could also be for another reason altogether, which could come to hurt your firm down the line.</p>

<p>Also, you need to value the worth of the client. Currently you are going to be doing $1.5 million this year, with this client it will be $2.5million. This client is valued at 40% of your revenue, which to me is a bad thing. If I was a founder, I may also think initially it is a good thing to have a big client, but sometimes if you have a lot of recurring smaller clients whilst experiencing super growth as you are, then having this big client could choke your ability to stay lean and grow (think about a situation where this 40% revenue-value client takes up 80% of your company resources - which is a very bad thing).</p>

<p>There are other strategies I could think of, but these are now moving towards opinion, so I will leave those out.</p>

<p>Lastly,</p>

<p>If this is true (and it's not some type of homework question) then I applaud you for your success. Well done! Keep up the good work.</p>
