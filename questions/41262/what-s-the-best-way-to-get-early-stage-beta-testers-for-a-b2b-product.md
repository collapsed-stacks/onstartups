With a MVP product ready, I am planning to launch my start-up in the coming days. My product is aimed at the recruitment industry. Any suggested ways to get people to use the free trial?

Having MVP ready, I assume you know your target customer. Just find couple of local businesses who might need it and try pitching them. There is no secret sauce. You need to sell you s..t.

If its a B2B product I would not suggest giving free trials. Instead try to sell your product. This way you will learn a lot about what your product is missing.
