<p>I want to resell electronic products on my online store exclusively. I will not buy stock, I will ask the manufacturers to dropship to my customers for each online order.  </p>

<p>Since it is a dropshipping business model, I won't buy a certain quantity then resell it. Therefore the manufacturer can't talk with its own suppliers/factory to get me a lower price based on quantity. What is then the usual solution to get lower prices in this case ?  </p>

<p>My business will be international and some of the manufacturers already have distributors in several countries. I would prefer to buy from those local distributors for faster delivery and technical support in the local language. However distributors won't be able to offer prices as low as the manufacturer could. What is then the usual solution to get lower prices in this case ?</p>
