What you can do is to record your lessons and give people access to it (something like 5 lessons videos for free, more for fee).

In that way, you can earn money several times for the same content. 

Or you can do the "Skype lessons" for more people at the same time - some kind of class. Your students can be interested by the question of other students and it can be a win-win solution. And of course, you can charge all of the students (the price should be lower than for one-to-one lesson, but in sum, it should be more - so at the end, 1 hour of your work can bring you more).
