I have been working on an application for starcraft, a game created by Blizzard. I was wondering if i could use the word "starcraft" in the title of the application. I was also wondering if i could use character names/pictures, building names/pictures, unit names/pictures ... etc. in the application or a website dedicated to the application?

Would i be getting trouble with Blizzard if i were to do this, if i were to be selling the application?

Would i be getting trouble with Blizzard if i were to do this, if i were to give the application away for free?

Would i be getting trouble with Blizzard if i were to do this, if i were to give the application away for free and ask for donations?

Thanks!

Blizzard, StarCraft, and the Blizzard and StarCraft logos, are all registered trademarks used to sell their games and books. You can **not** use their trademarks to promote your application, in **any** fashion, without their written permission.

This is not legal advice since I am not a lawyer. However trademark law is pretty simple.
