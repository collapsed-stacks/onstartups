So my friend came to me with a web idea a couple months ago. A few weeks back, I came around to it, and thought it would be awesome. I made the entire site in 3 weeks. It's now able to be tested (although I suck at web-design so it looks like crap).

Anyways, we think it can be something, so we paid for an angel investor ad, and actual heard back from one, and he's taking a look at it tonight on my over LogMeIn.com

I was just curious, what tips do you guys have? The design looks bad, and he knows we're hiring someone to change it, but I don't want that to be the reason he denies us.

Idk if this is the right place to ask this, I'm just really nervous/excited.

Thanks!

As exciting as it can be to have a great idea, you've got to remember that **investors don't bring the execution**.  They will be investing in *you* to execute.  So right off the bat, you've got to show you have the chops to get it done &mdash; creatively and technically.  And you've got to be able to sell it, too.

You are asking us to give you tips on a site which we can't see, but you admit is poorly designed.  That's not a good start, but it doesn't bury you on its own, either.

So the design is bad.  If you can't fix it, keep asking yourself questions...

* Does it work well?
* Is it [usable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability), or is it [programmer design](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/11/this-is-what-happens-when-you-let-developers-create-ui.html)?
* Can you talk the talk? In other words, do you know enough about what you are doing that the investor will believe that you can get it done?
* If you "suck at web design", do you at least know enough that you could direct someone you hire who doesn't suck?  And if you can't be the boss, who is going to be?

Lastly, you should remember that getting "invested in" isn't all there is to it.  If you have to be **X** "good" to be invested in, you have to be **X Ã— 10** "good" to be invested in and retain a good portion of the company by the time it's making any money.

If it is so early that you have pretty much no users and bad design, the reason this investor would be looking is to just gauge the general direction you are heading to.  He might want to see if you are aiming for large or interesting targets.

It sounds like some sort of a logging in platform.  Correct?  He just wants to see if there is anything innovative there.  Is there? :)
