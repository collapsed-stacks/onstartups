I think the wording in the beginning of your post is telling of how you should proceed. You, yourself are not a start-up. Once you've identified a problem you are passionate about solving, and start working toward solving it, then you've got something - the operative word here is "start".

If none of the ideas your considering right now really stands out, as something you are passionate about developing, keep brainstorming. Chances are dozens of others have had the same ideas as you, and someone is probably working on it, but the one with the passion to carry it out has the best chances of making it out of the idea/development stage.

In either case, Silicon Valley is certainly not a must. In fact, it could stunt your creativity. The group-mind environment in the valley can be beneficial, but I don't think it's going to have any impact on finding your idea. If you fall in love with an idea and have a hard time finding developers/partners/investors - then a move to the valley might be wise. Until then focus on finding that one great idea and not distracting yourself with relocation.

In the meantime, float some of your ideas by people whose opinions you trust. You'll likely uncover which ones are worth pursuing, and have a better vision of what the solution looks like by garnering feedback.

You don't have to travel to Silicon Valley to narrow down a business idea. 

The first step would be to find whether one or many pain point(s) you know needs to be solved can be solved or whether you can build a better solution than an existing solution which exists in the market. 

Once you answer the 'What' you need to build the 'How' to build it will come later.

Do you plan to implement the websites yourself?  Its not clear what you would gain in silicon valley that you couldn't determine by doing research on the Internet.

If you are looking for resources, Silicon Valley probably has a lot of great candidates but they could be very expensive unless this would be an equity play.

I would narrow down your list by a measure of feasibility.  In other words, do the most feasible idea first and once that is deployed and sustainable, then look at beginning the other ideas.

By the time you get your company and website off the ground, the trends in Silicon Valley will be different. Don't base your decision on what seems likely to succeed today. Think about where the market will be when you are ready to launch.

Remember, starting a business is a *lot* of work. The most important thing is that *you* are excited and passionate about the idea, not what some investor thinks.

There are plenty of supporters for the idea that you should move to an Innovation Hub like Silicon Valley. The Valley has seen many, many, many startups come and go.  It has developed a method (or several methods) of evaluating startups, and a culture around entrepreneurship.

You'll meet people here who've encountered every conceivable problem that you'll encounter.  Ways to fund your startup, how to tweak your idea if its not gaining traction, etc. etc.

We recently had a group of Finnish students come here to "soak in the culture" of the Valley - aaltoes.com.  Met some of them, they were very eager to understand what makes the Valley tick and how they can form a "partnership" with the Valley where both could benefit from each other.

I was giving two seasoned entrepreneurs a ride in my car and they were going on and on about how they wanted to help their alma mater - University of Michigan. These were people who'd already made their money, and you should've heard their passion in wanting to help the students from Michigan benefit from the "frameworks of thinking" that are prevalent in the Valley.

So in sum, make it out here if you can.
