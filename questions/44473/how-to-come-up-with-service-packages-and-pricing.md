I have a break fix IT company right now, but I'm trying to transition to a managed service provider role.  I believe I have everything in place, but the one thing I just can't seem to wrap my arms around is packaged pricing. Can someone provide some information on how to come up with service packages and pricing?

One of my friends who runs a pretty successful MSP doesn't really have packages. They charge a set rate for desktops and a set rate for servers and it's pretty much all inclusive. I think there are some 'add-ons' for remote backup and things like that but if it's "managed" it's expected you'll be taking care of issues that arise and if no issues arise then great you are doing a good job.  It might be something like $150/mo per desktop. Somewhere around there. These are business desktops not residential.  There is also some add-on you can purchase that every 3 years they replace your computer. So replacement cost of the hardware is  built in to your monthly fee.

Find some credible looking MSP's online and call or email them to get a quote ;)
See how a successful company packages and sells it.

The answer to your questions can be found by what your customers require the most.

If PC-Tuneup and Anti-virus removals are the two common ones, then offer that as a package for X/month. Mention that 1 anti-virus removal per month is included or something.

As for the price, find out how much it costs you to do the work, then charge based on that.
