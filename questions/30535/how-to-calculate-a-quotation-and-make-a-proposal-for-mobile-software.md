I have received an RFP from a small company to build an Android app. They have asked for a time/cost estimation together with a time chart for the given product specification (which is 25 pages + 30 pages of appendix including images). 

How long should my proposal be? 

What should it include? 

How do I calculate the costs and time? 

Is there any template out there that I can follow?

Sorry for the newbie questions but I appreciate any pointers!

> *How long should my proposal be?*

How complex is the application?

> *What should it include?*

Depends on the app they want you to create.

> *How do I calculate the costs and time?*

How much is your time worth?

> *Is there any template out there that I can follow?*

There is no 'cookie-cutter' for success in any industry, though assuming you're refering to proposals, not really - or at least I wouldn't recommend it. 

Now the serious part - you just need to have a sit down and think about what exactly is required of you. Nobody here can answer for your exact situation. If I were putting a typical proposal together for any development work, I would include an overview, then a contents page going into scrutinous detail so any parties involved that sign are left without any doubt or uncertain terms. 

Yes, you'll want to include a timeline and costs but I couldn't ever guide you on that - you could be tasked with developing an uncomprehendably complicated app for all I know, and you could be earning $200k in your 'day job', meaning your time is worth no less than that spent elsewhere.
