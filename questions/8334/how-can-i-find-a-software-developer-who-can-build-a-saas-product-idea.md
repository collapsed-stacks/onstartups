I have a great idea for a SaaS product but all my knowledge is in the subject matter not technology.  If my social network doesn't have any good contacts how can I find someone trustworthy to work with?

First question to get over is whether you need a partner or you can hire an employee.

The next steps depend on that...

<p>To expand on what @gmagana said, you should hire an employee if you have money AND time.  If you don't have the time, the sort of managing and spec writing you need to do for an employee to build something like that won't work (just try outsourcing it to elance and you'll find out what I mean).</p>

<p>I suggest you start your search at <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/" rel="nofollow">StackOverflow careers</a>.  You can post your opening (and get your money back if it doesn't work out) or you can search the resume database.</p>

<p>If you don't have the time, then go with finding a partner.  If you're only at the <em>idea</em> stage, you'll likely have to offer lots of equity.</p>

Justin, 

The previous comment from @gmagana is correct - you need to determine if you want a partner, employee, solo freelancer, or dev team to help you. Once you do that, you can post on a job board or do some searches in your area for developers (i.e. Ruby on Rails Austin) or start finding networking events to locate a development partner. 

I recently wrote an article on how to select a development team for your startup. This will help you filter through any candidates you identify to see if they are a good fit.

All the best in your new venture!

James

Justin - 

There are a lot of outsourced software development firms that could probably work depending on your idea, however there is definitely a trade-off between cost and service so keep that in mind if you decide to go that route (in one of my startups we used outsourced Indian developers and had to completely throw away their work after 3 months).

One firm that we worked with and had good results with is Scio Consulting.  They were a good fit because they focus on SaaS and web apps and are nearshore.

In addition, you should consider building your product using a platform as a service (PaaS) in whichever language your developer(s) are most comfortable with (e.g. Origo Networks for .NET development)
