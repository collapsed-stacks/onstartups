I am currently looking for a co-founder.
 
The current candidate and I are still students, and we are not experienced in business at all. However, I know he loves sales and marketing, and he usually gets a part-time job with promotion companies, etc. 

My question is, since I'm starting a software business which will need internet marketing, will this guy be the right co-founder or should I look for someone else? From what I'm reading everyone is talking about finding someone who already has some internet following and experience. 

Also, is looking for someone on the internet a good idea? I'm very sceptical about it. Don't you have to know and get along with the person you will be sharing a business with?

Can you find a girlfriend on the Internet? Is it a good idea? You need someone you can trust, someone you can work with it, someone you know well. As in love, experience can help probably, but can also be stopper for new ideas.

I would start with finding out what skills you have and which ones you are missing in the founding team. For a software company three main skill buckets are:

1. Sales and marketing
2. Design and development
3. Implementations and support

Each founder should be good at most of them...but atleast one of these needs to be "owned" by a Founder.

Also, make a good honest list of values you care for. Now looking for a partner can be fairly random, but eliminating people from your search due to a mismatch of values and long term goals makes it easier.

Good luck!

I think this need itself is a good business idea! Someone should think of something like a business-dating site.

In any case, you should go ahead with the current candidate depending on whether you **trust him as a person** fully. Skills sets can be enhanced over time, but the core of person would remain the same mostly.

Check out StartupWithMe.com, FounderMatch.net, and MatchFounders.com

I think the internet is a great place to start your search, but I highly suggest meeting in person and **working together for a few days** before you give it a go.  First and foremost, you want to make sure your co-founder will be totally dedicated (and same goes for you).  You guys need to be able to work together, and you should NOT agree on everything.

I am also getting started and on a similar path and here is what has helped me so far: Read the book: The E-myth Revisited. Once you set out/draw and write down what you really need, lot of answers become clear automagically.
