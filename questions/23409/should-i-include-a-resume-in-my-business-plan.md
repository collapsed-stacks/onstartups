I am building my business plan and am getting close to completion (well, for the first iteration, you know how things change!) 

Should I be including my resume in my business plan? I have started four companies before (which I still run); however most of them are fairly small, part-time endeavors. I'm imagining I need to significantly alter my resume for a plan looking for funding when compared to say, applying for a job somewhere. 

I guess I'm wondering if this is required and if so, what kinds of things should I put on there? I've seen some negative posts about having an MBA (which I have), so should I exclude that from it?

It's traditional to include a biography, but not necessarily a full resume. This might be the kind of thing you would see on the "About the Management" page of any corporate website: a picture and a narrative description of all the relevant things you have done and possibly your main educational accomplishments.

I don't see any reason to leave off an MBA. It's still an accomplishment, even if you didn't learn a single thing useful to business!

I am not sure whether you need to include a formal resume in your business plan. But it does not harm, of course. Nevertheless, expressing the fact about WHO is behind the whole undertaking is extremely important.
If it's a first round with your investors, be prepared that nobody actually reads your plan document. If they do, then only the first 1-2 chapters. I suggest you to include few clips about yourself into the executive summary and devote a chapter to this topic.
