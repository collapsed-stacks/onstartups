It's not just a simple question. It's about how passionate you are for your idea.
Since the conception. 
I'm fully passionate for my idea. Thats what turns my product into a greatest, easyiest to use, sexyiest product to myself.

I love work on it every day.

So, how passionate are you for your product? And how this passion changes the way you see, and sell it?

It's hard not to "love" something that you've dedicated so much time and money towards. And that love obviously helps motiviate to do everything that much better.

But watch out - that very same love can blind you, too. You may not see the flaws and critical omissions that would make the product a success. Others might not see the product fulfilling the same need/niche that you do.

I don't see why somebody will work on new product unless he absolutely loves it.<br> Moneywise and timewise it is much better to work for payroll, startup takes from you all you can give and even more. How can you continue to give unless you are deeply in love? <br>
The only thing you should keep in mind that your passion might prevent you from admitting week sides of your idea and choosing right direction to go. <br>
I think working on a new startup is very similar to rising a child - you start with unquestionable love, but as the baby grows you should add to your love wisdom and ability to see how you can help your child to improve herself.

Yes, I love my program.

It's been a part of my daily life for over 10 years. 

I talk about it. I think about it. I blog about it. I plan my future with it.

Now if only I could finish it.

I love the VISION of what my product is and can be. I have a dream/sci-fi alike idea of how it will look after years of development.

In the other hand I don't love the suffering of doing a lot of hard work (technical, conceptual, research) to reach that vision. But great things are not easy, that's the price.
