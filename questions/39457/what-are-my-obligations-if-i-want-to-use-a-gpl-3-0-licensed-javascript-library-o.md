I don't want to modify it, and the script itself has URLs to their site in the header. They have a commercial version for sale, but I want to know when I should pay for it. Here's the **[GPL-3.0 license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)**.

1. Do I need to provide a download link of the software on my site?
  
   Or a link to their site?
   
   Or just the license?
2. Do I need to offer the source of my site as GPL-3.0 also?
3. Can I use it if my site is for a for-profit business?
4. What's the tipping point for needing to purchase a commercial license?

<li>Yes, sort of ... you need to provide the source in some way <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#SourceInCVS" rel="nofollow">Check for instance</a> "[...]as long as the source checkout process does not become burdensome or otherwise restrictive" </li>
<li>Sort of, either GPL or a GPL compatible license. From the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#IfLibraryIsGPL" rel="nofollow">GNU FAQ</a> "If a library is released under the GPL (not the LGPL), does that mean that any software which uses it has to be under the GPL or a GPL-compatible license? Yes, because the software as it is actually run includes the library."</li>
<li>Yes, nothing in GPL prevents you from charging for the product/code</li>
<li>Wishing to leave the GPL license - no size limit or anything like that</li>
</ol>

<p>However at the end of this, rread the license, the FAQ and make sure you get advice from proper legal advisors!</p>
