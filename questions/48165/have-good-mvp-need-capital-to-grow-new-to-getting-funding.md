We have what we believe is a pretty solid MVP for a enterprise software product. Without much advertising, we've had people find our website and purchase and use the product, and the initial feedback has been very positive.

Our product is in the $1.8 billion-a-year space, and we have pretty modest expectations of where we can be. Given some initial marketing and the right moves, we think we can easily crack 0.1% of the space, which equates to revenues of $1.8 million a year (and of course anything more would be delightful!)

At this point, we are looking to grow and market the product rapidly, and would like to bring in a seed/angel or other investor for the following reasons:

* To get advice on exit strategies
* Get introductions to their network
* Get investment for improving our product and marketing it

We're not too worried about giving up control or giving out equity, since we feel having a good investor will more than pay back any loss of control/equity.

However, we are a little cautious in terms of how the whole funding round works. How would we - engineers with a MVP and no prior startup experience - go about seeking funding. We're *not* necessarily targeting big name seed/angel companies, and we're fine with anyone who offers us a fair deal to help propel our product.

If you haven't already got it, I'd recommend Venture Deals by Brad Feld, which covers a lot of good stuff about looking for investment, etc.

Also, don't mention the 0.1% of $x billion market to anyone, as people frown on that kind of thing.
