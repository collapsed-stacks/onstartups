I have recently given up my job and now I'm setting up a new company to import goods.

Having worked for 19 years in the other work place now I feel a bit frustrated, and nervous in setting up the new company.

I want to avoid these feelings and concentrate on my new venture which I feel going to be a success. How could I do that?

Adrian, you've taken a big step and a big risk in doing so and I believe it's OK to feel nervous about it. Everybody thinks "what if things go wrong"? It's perfectly natural.
But you know what? You have the guts that many other don't, and that counts a lot.

Think positive, plan and perform small steps. That will help your morale.

"Divide to conquer", i. e., you have your long term main goal, so split it into small easy to achieve goals towards the main goal. As you start succeeding in those small goals, you'll have more confidence and you'll get less nervous. 
Even when things don't go as you expect, you'll not get totally frustrated, because you already know you're on the right track, it's just that sometimes there are some problems along the way and one has to re-plan accordingly.

So, my main message is: start accomplishing small things, once you do that, you'll get more confident and less frustrated... I cannot guarantee that you'll get less nervous because that depends a lot on your personality, and beside, and entrepreneur is always living on the edge (at least until he gets the "Screw You Money")...

Congratulations! As far as the uncertainty you are feeling, remember why you chose to take this leap. One of the best things you can do for yourself is to make a plan; make it flexible as you trek up the learning curve; and believe in yourself. 

Personally, when I'm feeling anxiety about work-related issues, I make sure that I do not go to sleep without having a to-do list for the next day. Staying on task and having a clear list of what needs to be done will go a long way in curbing that gnawing feeling in you're bound to feel. 

Put your blinders on and be brave.

<p>I believe it's generally bad form to post links to your own stuff (so I usually don't), but I wrote <a href="http://cornerstonetechnology.com/blog/2010/02/back-on-the-rollercoaster/" rel="nofollow">an article</a> on the <strong>rollercoaster that is starting a new business</strong>, dealing with the <strong>negative emotions</strong> you may feel working in your startup.  Importantly, the article has a number of links to other people's (doubtless better) material - I hope you find it helpful.</p>

<p>You may be encouraged to learn that it is <strong>not much better even second time around</strong>, at least in my experience.  It is a general human condition - we derive a lot of security from working for someone else, but in my view, it is misplaced.  </p>
