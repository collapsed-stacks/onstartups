I'm working on a personal project that I hope to be able to turn into a company onwards into the future. If I incorporated now I feel it would bring in a lot of legal issues I'm not capable of dealing with while working on developing. But I'd still like to arrange deals with designers/others to do work in exchange for future ownership or payment.

How is this done?

<p>It depends on the laws of the country where you live, but a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding" rel="nofollow">Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</a> could be a good solution. You should look for legal advise to write it properly, but it's certainly cheaper than setting up a company with all the documents, shareholding agreements and bylaws in place.</p>
