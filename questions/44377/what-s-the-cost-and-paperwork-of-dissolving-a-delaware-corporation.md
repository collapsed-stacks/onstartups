I have been working with my co-founder for the past year and recently we decided to part ways. However, about 2 months ago we incorporated our business in Delaware. Each of us is starting from scratch and doing our own thing and want to dissolve this incorporation and start with a clean slate.

 1. What's the cost of dissolving a Delaware corporation and are there
   any by-product fees?
 2. What's the paperwork that needs to be done? Can this be done online?

Thanks for any help.

Sorry, but there is not a short, definitive answer to your question.

You need to decide which of the several dissolution forms ( http://corp.delaware.gov/corpformscorp09.shtml ) to use based on the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ( http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc10/index.shtml ) given your corporation's circumstances.

Each dissolution form is accompanied by a statement of the applicable filing fee. In addition, you need to make sure all taxes are paid and any other debts or obligations are taken care of.
