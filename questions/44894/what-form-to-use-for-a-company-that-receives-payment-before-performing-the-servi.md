In the business to consumer world it is too difficult to get paid after the services has been done. Therefore our company mandates that payment be sent first.

So we do not fit into the usual a) estimate, b) doing the work, c) invoicing and d) sales receipt that most company fit in.

I am trying to figure out what document I can send to clients at the beginning of the process to get pay and iron out the costs and terms.

Difficulties:

The definition of an invoice is: A document detailing the prices of a service that has been done. This is in the past, *has been done*. So I cannot use an invoice as we have not done any work yet.

I cannot use an estimate since the value demanded is not uncertain. It is well known and must be paid immediately. 

I cannot use a sales receipt since no transaction has taken place.

What form do I use.

<p>A <strong>pro-forma invoice</strong>, which looks exactly like a real invoice, but it states what will be provided upon payment. You can then follow up with a bona-fide invoice after delivery which states Paid-in-full on it, assuming of course the bill is paid.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_forma#Invoices" rel="nofollow">wikipedia's entry</a> on this.</p>
