I am planning on starting a blog about fashion and shopping and wanted to use great clothes I find online on my blog. I wanted to use images and prices and link back to the site - like Nordstrom or Bloomingdales. Do you know if I need express permission or a partnership to do this?

The quickest thing to do is check the site's terms of use policy (use the browser's find button on the page, but it's usually on a link near the bottom).

The next thing you can do is become a resale affiliate, but of course this takes away from your credibility. Note: folks might think you are just trying to sell clothes - and might think that even without the link looking like an affiliate URL.

The final thing to do is call the company, but beware that customer service is usually woefully misinformed. They will almost definitely say "not sure, but no" - because it's easier than finding out who to send you to, and much much easier to stay out of trouble with a call center supervisor.

In case I forget, if you ever get a yes, get it in writing (via email at the very least). They should actually be happy to let you do it, since it's free Advertising for them. Some sites even pay people to outright blog about their products!

The not so good way is to do it anyway and just stop and point to some other website when they send you a nasty letter (which is unlikely unless you disparage the site/clothing).

So, have some free time and little expenses do you?

The short answer is 'not without their consent'.

As indicated above, their terms and conditions may contain a consent - subject to the origin of the material being acknowledged, or you may be able to obtain that consent separately.  

In the latter case, it is not only getting it in writing /via email which is important, but getting it from someone who appears (from their job-title) to be senior enough to have the authority to give you that consent - not a call handler at the customer services desk.

You will need to ask an attorney this question.  I am not an attorney (and if I were, I'd be charging you for this answer).

Generally speaking, you can't just feel free to use somebody else's content.  Tread carefully.

I did something similar to this once.  The way I approached this was to contact the marketing department for the company and then acquire their permission.  I had an attorney create a standard document that we got someone with authority to sign stating that I had permission to use their content for a certain purpose.  Sometimes it took several phone calls to accomplish this.  It was a time consuming task, but in the end I don't think I had anyone who actually denied my request.

Would it be possible to get the images you need from sources that use a creative commons license?  For example, perhaps you could find a picture that is licensed under creative commons on flickr wearing something that you wanted to blog about.

Let me know where to find your blog.  I don't know fashion very well, but I love checking out new blogs!
