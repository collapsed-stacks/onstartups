I've started a website for a fantasy football game.  It will launch next year for the 2012-2013 Season.  I have a phenomenally designed site, with an extremely marketable name.  I have some great connections with a marketing company that can create buzz with NFL Players, problem is I will need money for the marketing.  Where is a good place to go to find LEGITIMATE investors?  I'm tired of searching thru search engines and running into the same unsuccessful links.  At this point I'm feeling like my best opportunity to find actual investors is to apply for Shark Tank.  Any advice is appreciated.
