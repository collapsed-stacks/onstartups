Would the startup visa, in its current state and if approved, be retroactive?

What I mean is, if someone gets enough founding today, would they be able to apply for the visa when it gets approved?

Regardless of the answer to that, I think if you have the possibility to secure $250K funding today, don't delay it hoping to see the startup visa bill passed. The best piece of advice would be that you go on doing business as if you are NOT going to have a startup visa. Always plan for the worst.

Just my opinion,
