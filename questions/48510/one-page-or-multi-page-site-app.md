I am wondering whether to have a one page site design that is en vogue at the moment or a more traditional layout.On a long one-page design it seems that I can work the user through the AIDA principles down the page and hope to secure a booking at the end of the page. On a multiple page design, the user would have to select the booking page to navigate to it. What are the pros and cons of one page versus multipage sites?

<p>This will sound like a compromise, but it doesn't have to be: <strong>Use both</strong>.</p>

<p>If your main goal is for users to book your service, and you have the correct content and architecture to keep a user's attention in a vertical layout, I believe the success rate can be quite good (Betterment's <a href="http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/inspiration/long-page-scrolling-designs" rel="nofollow">Long Page Scrolling Designs That Work</a> is a nice article on this subject). </p>

<p>But this doesn't mean you can't have internal pages that do the same. More <em>pages</em> can mean more <em>landing pages</em> too, and a menu to link to them isn't really invasive. </p>

<p>In short, pros of multiple pages: More keywords, more landing pages. Cons: Possible oceans of content, extra steps to your goal (booking). If done right (and if you project justifies it! This is important, <strong>not every site has the same requirements</strong> - I'[m assuming you've done your research and decided your product could work nicely with a scrolling site), <strong>a long scrolling site can beat one with multiple short pages</strong>.</p>
