## CA Labor Code Section 2870, does this apply to out of state employees?

If I live in another state, and work (salary + telecommunte) for a company located in CA, (EA with the usual "Works For Hire Agreement" which states *"The Company shall be the sole and exclusive owner throughout the universe in perpetuity of all of the results and proceeds of Employeeâ€™s services, work and labor during the term of his or her employment with the Company..."*), then does CA Labor Code 2870 (protections of the employee's personal time/work that complies with #a 1 & 2) also apply to that out-of-state employee BECAUSE the employer is located in CA (not in employee's state)? 

Or does 2870 only protect residents of CA, and so the employer can claim ownership of the moonlighting work I do, since my state has no equiv to 2870?

Note that the employer does not have offices in my state, so part of this question is: can their only venue be the state(s) where they have offices?

Thanks!

California courts protect moonlighting employees for almost all CA companies, regardless of whether the employee is out of state. If your employer is a multi-state one, however, you'll need to take some things into account:

If your official place of employment is CA than most likely CA law would apply. Of course if this is important to you then you should confirm with a CA lawyer.

You are careful not to use any company provided resources (computer, internet connection pencils etc.) for your personal projects aren't you.
