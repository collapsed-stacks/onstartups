We are setting up idea for a few programming/math courses we'd like to offer online. Can anyone with experience in this area suggest the kind of setup, the software, the fee structure, etc?

Thanks

You might want to check out Moodle. It's an open source e-learning platform. It's really rich. The layout that it comes with is not very pretty but if you get someone familiar with Moodle, they will be able to make it look really nice. It has many, many features that you can install almost immediately.

<p>I have no idea what to suggest for fees, but if you are not already familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable%5FContent%5FObject%5FReference%5FModel" rel="nofollow">SCORM</a>, you should probably become so.</p>

There are two on-line universities/schools that I am familiar with. They are:

http://www.khanacademy.org/ -- Free YouTube Videos

http://edufire.com/ -- Pay video classes

I don't want to be that guy, but if you look into khanacademy I don't see how can anyone create more compelling math content and make money on it. He is planning to take on programming courses too. All free of charge.

Maybe very specific programming course would do. For instance lack of quality HTML5 training.

I believe that the real money in universities is in building a brand. This is of course very hard, but one strategy could be to join up with an authority in the field and provide him/her with the opportunity to say that they have created their own school, which utilizes their own teaching strategies. You should adjust your charges depending on the brand.
