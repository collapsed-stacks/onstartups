I have a startup music business where I can produce, but am not limited to, an entire 18-piece big-band ala Hoyt Curtin ("The Jetsons", "Flintstones" etc.) overnight without any recording expenses to the client -saving them thousands.

I'm considering to hire/ train someone to do what I do under a confidentiality agreement.  I use commercial software in a unique way to achieve the above results.

**Question:** Obviously, I can't patent a key-stroke or software's built-in functionality but how then do I protect my idea while expanding the company?  In other words, is it even possible to successfully shape a confidentiality agreement to prevent this person from using my trade secret for any of his own freelance musical productions if it involves commercially available software that I'm using in a way that other's haven't thought of yet?

Thanks much

Yes, you can definitely protect yourself with a good contract.  People do this all the time.

First, you should consider whether you want to hire a employee vs. retaining an independent contractor.  Hiring an employee comes with a lot of overhead that you may not want.

Regardless of which way you go, your contract can include:

 - a non-disclosure agreement so the person can't tell others what you are doing
 - a non-competition agreement so he can't go off and do the same thing (legality and scope depends on where you are)

You could try doing this yourself by googling for similar contracts but you are probably better off getting a lawyer to draft one for you.  I would guess you could get one for under $1000.

<p>Your agreement with the individual you have chosen needs to include not only confidentiality provisions but, also, provisions assigning to you everything the individual creates for you, including all intellectual property rights therein. For more on this topic, please see <a href="http://danashultz.com/blog/2009/05/26/why-%E2%80%9Cwork-made-for-hire%E2%80%9D-is-a-term-made-for-confusion/" rel="nofollow">Why “Work Made for Hire” is a Term Made for Confusion</a>.</p>

<p>I see that you are in NY, so non-compete provisions are germane, but I don't have a lot to say about that, because I'm in CA, where non-competes are enforced only under narrowly-defined circumstances.</p>
