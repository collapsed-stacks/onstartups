We're forming a 2 person LLC and part of what we're trying to figure out is how much to leave in the LLC to build up some capital reserves.

Since an LLC is a pass through tax entity if the LLC earns $100,000 and then we leave $30,000 in each year, my understanding is that on our taxes we'll still pay income tax on the $100k regardless of how much we leave in the LLC. Is that correct? 

Is there any difference at all from a tax perspective between the money that we distribute to ourselves and the money we leave in the LLC?

<p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>You are correct that an LLC is treated as a pass-through entity by <em>default</em>, and as a result you will have to pay income taxes on all of your profit, whether you distribute it or not.</p>

<p><strong>But there is a way around this.</strong> You can choose to have your LLC taxed as a corporation by filing <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf" rel="nofollow">Form 8832 Entity Classification Election</a> with the IRS. This allows you to keep your business structure as an LLC, while opting for corporate taxation. In this case, if you only take out $30K, then you will only have to pay income taxes on that $30K, and you can leave the remaining $70K untouched.</p>

<p>You should speak to your accountant about this. He/She can tell you if this makes sense for your particular situation.</p>
