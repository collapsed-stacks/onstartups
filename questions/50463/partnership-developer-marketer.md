I'm a developer who is leaving his job next month to pursue a startup. I've come up with the idea, and I have the skills and drive to implement it. 

My partner is in marketing and an excellent salesman. I feel having him on board is an invaluable asset. 

I'm wondering what kind of partnership we should work out. I've read 50/50 is the best, but realistically until the product is complete, I'll be doing all the work. Theres no way he can leave his job to work full time, and until the product exists, theres really no point. How have people in the past worked out this type of situation?

I've seen similar questions to this, but none answer it exactly.

Thanks!

This may be slightly tongue-in-cheek but surely there will come a point in your startup where the concept is built and he earns his fair share with the very hard work of selling customers and handling customer service.

If you actually think you bring so much more *to the execution*, then present a case around it to your partner. But I am of the opinion that the idea is only a small value to a startup. The true value comes in executing on growth and that takes committed team members.

Its hard to imagine a committed pair of founders where the equity doesn't go 50-50.
