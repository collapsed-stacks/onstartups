I'm looking for accounting software a software developer would be happy with.

* Available integration with most big US banks.
* Ability to submit tax forms electronically.
* An API I can call into to send payments, send off tax forms, run payroll, and monitor to perform custom alerting.
* Something I can host on a server or pay a fee for a hosted solution.

No programmer would accept accounting software I've seen so far, that requires manual intervention for nearly every task rather than automation and management by exception.

So - what have others found?

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.xero.com/" rel="nofollow">Xero.com</a>.  Very robust API.  Out of the requirements you posted, the only one I'm not sure about is filing tax returns through the app.</p>
