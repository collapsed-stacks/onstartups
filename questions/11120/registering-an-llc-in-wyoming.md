I am interested to register an LLC in Wyoming, but I currently do not have a US address. Is this possible? Do I also need a registered agent to register my LLC in Wyoming? Based on your experience, what is the recommendable registered agent that serve Wyoming area?

Thank you very much in advance for your guidance.

<p>Why Wyoming, especially if you're out of state? </p>

<p>Have you considered Delaware? </p>

<p>They have probably the most business friendly laws. Also, you do not have to be present in the state to have your business registered if you have an agent. Because there are so many companies are registered there and a lot of them are out of state there are plenty of agents, some are as low as $50/yr. I've been using this one for years: <a href="http://www.delawareinc.com" rel="nofollow">Harvard Business Services, Inc.</a> and would recommend them.</p>
