Say I have a brilliant idea for a startup, and need to raise $5mn from private investors.
I have a BP that shows that in 5yrs investors can have a 20% return per year, after i took out my share of the company, in this case 25%. So, investors keep 75% of the company and for the 1st 5yrs have a return of 20% per year.
BUT... if my projections are wrong and i deliver a greater return, i would like to have a bigger share.
Lets say,i would like to have 35%, not 25%, if investors could have 30% return per year with a 65% share of the company.

Is it fair? How do I structure this?

I think you need to do a little more research into what investors are looking for.

How are you "taking out your 25% share"?

I don't think anyone will take you seriously with that equity proposal.  You might be able to have bonuses tied to performance, but (IMO) sliding equity for a founder is probably going to land you in the "not serious" business plan pile...

Ignoring the compensation structure, 5 years is a long time.  Consider raising less money for shorter milestones.  $5M is also not very much cash for a 5 year runway; most would tell you $20M is a better number (than 5) for 5 yrs.  However, I say this with no knowledge of what type of business you are talking about.
