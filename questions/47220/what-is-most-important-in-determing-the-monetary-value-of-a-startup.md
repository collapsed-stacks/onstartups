Part of a startup is the (hopeful) sale in the end.

Corporations often buy companies for revenue, but would you rather have a company with stronger revenue or net profit?

For example: is a company with $10 million revenue and $5 million profit worth more than a company with $7 million profit and $6 million revenue?

The 1 times revenue is just a simplistic rule of thumb.

The answer is really about time, especially the future. That is, the valuation today will depend partly on history, partly on the present situation, but mostly upon the future prospects for growth, revenue and market development and dominance.
