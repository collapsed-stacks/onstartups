I work for my father and his partner for one Home Health (company A) in city C which has been running for 5  years now. My father, me and a few other people have setup another Home Health company B in city B. This company B has certification for non-skilled work in city D which company A doesn't have. Company A has the non-skilled certification in City C. Now because I operate both business I would like for them to share resources like Billing and Payroll. 

Basically I would like the non-skilled part of company A to go to company B so that we can operate them more effectively. (The non-skilled part of the company doesn't have to follow the strict requirement for being under the skilled part) 

So Company A would be skilled only having a branch in city D and company B would be have a branch in City C. What would be the best way to set this up without being unfair on any of the people involved.

The best way is for Company B to purchase Company A. This can be an all-stock transaction where the owners in Company A end up with shares in Company B and no cash trades hands.

You need to figure out the percentages, negotiation should help you here.

Another option is to have Company A outsource billing and payroll to Company B - this option would keep the companies as two separate legal entities.

Should actually be easy to do but you might need a lawyer to help you with the paperwork.
