What is the single most useful accounting book for the bootstrapped entrepreneur?  It is my single largest flaw in my business education, I imagine a lot of people are in the same boat.

<p>The best book I've read on accounting/bookkeeping is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0767917065" rel="nofollow"><strong>Bookkeeping Made Simple</strong></a>. The basics are well explained. It doesn't cover tax structures and other advanced accounting topics; however, a solid understanding of the fundamentals presented in this book should be the first step. It's also a very quick read if you skip the exercises.</p>

<p>Personally, I was able to have a much more intelligent conversations with my CPA after reading this book.</p>

<p>For more, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XL7KK3ER6G97/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0767917065&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=&amp;linkCode=" rel="nofollow">my 4 star review on Amazon</a>.</p>

**Rich Dad, Poor Dad** changed how I manage money forever. I sold my luxury car because of it. 

It will not replace real accounting, but will teach you why people struggle, regardless the amount of money they earn. Including your accountant and banker.
