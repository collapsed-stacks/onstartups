I'm setting up a UK limited company to run a large music ensemble, and people will pay a subscription to take part, but I won't be able to afford to pay most positions (managing concerts, publicity, etc) as employees. Many ensembles are run by volunteers, but they have the incentive of being membership organisations with participants controlling the ensemble at general meetings. I'd like to encourage volunteers to take on some of the roles in my organisation but don't want to just expect them to do something for nothing.

Is there a good way to promote this, perhaps with a type of non-voting share giving a dividend of the profits that expires when they leave the "committee" equivalent? I'm open to most ideas at this early stage.

I'm wary of creating a situation where I unwittingly create partners or other liabilities.
