All over the internet, the consensus seems to be that when you are looking for funding it is important to approach angels or VCs through an introduction from someone they know,  rather than cold. 

I'm looking for funding for a technology company (a bit over $1 mil) and am based in Australia. Although I am quite willing to be funded by investors from the US, Europe or Asia, I can't go and hang out in a cafe in Silicon Valley.

I'm sure there are people on the forum who have done this successfully. How did you go about the funding process and get those introductions?

Just to clarify: the other founders are in the US and Finland - so we are truly a global business!

Here is what I would do:

1. Figure out which international VCs have backed businesses that originated in Oz in the last 3 years. 

2. Use LinkedIn to network to the entrepreneurs who started those businesses.

3. Ask them to connect you with their VC if they think your business could fit their investment approach. 

Your best bet will be to approach VCs who have had some success backing businesses and teams that originated in Australia. Additionally, if they have investments that are still based or partially-based there, they will be happy to consider other investments that could allow them to leverage their travel and time there.

Though i did not get funding for my own application but lot of them are interested in my app after first phase of release and i got interacted with them through b-plan competitions and also through linkedin and other few social networking sites.

If you'r idea is worth enough you don need to wait for some one who will introduce you to them. I have seen this even with my friends who got funding from angel investors and they contacted them directly. Investors see only teams profile and idea . 

Other things doesn't really matter while going to investors

Unfortunately, it's all who you know or may know. Investors only want to be introduced -- you will rarely get anywhere with a cold call, etc.

I would take a look at Venture Hack's Angel List or go to a Meetup in your area. Australia is going to be tough since there is not a lot of VC money down there.

Also, see if you can meet local entrepreneurs in your area or even a "quick" flight away. The more you interact with the local business people, the more contact you can get.

<p>Find an event that can get you a lot of exposure in the US, then it will be worth coming out for it. Obviously taking a trip without any contacts is risky, so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have your product/pitch ready.</li>
<li>Get in touch with a podcast like This Week In Startups and ask to pitch Jason</li>
<li>Ask him if you are good enough to come to the <a href="http://launch.is/" rel="nofollow">Lauch conference</a> or <a href="http://openangelforum.com/" rel="nofollow">Open Angel Forum</a></li>
<li>He will give you "ok" or feedback for improvement. If you do come people will see extra effort in travel and try to help you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, the foundation to all this is having something of value to show.
Good luck</p>
