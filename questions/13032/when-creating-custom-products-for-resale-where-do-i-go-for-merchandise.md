If I want to have mugs printed, for instance, do I just go to the guys who print mugs for promotional uses, or is there some way to find a manufacturer? I've been looking online forever to see how people do this and I'm not coming up with any good answers.

For instance, if I want my company name on the bottom of the mug instead of the company who printed it, don't I have to go to the source?

<p>You can go to a printing company like <a href="http://www.cafepress.com" rel="nofollow">Cafepress</a> or <a href="http://www.zazzle.com" rel="nofollow">Zazzle</a>, though it sounds like you want to bypass those middlemen and go right to the source.</p>

<p>One idea is to use <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/" rel="nofollow">Alibaba</a>, an "online business-to-business trading platform for small businesses," as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba.com" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia defines</a> it. Basically, you can use this service to find manufacturers around the world (not just China). From there, you could work out a deal to print your company name on a bottom of a mug, for instance.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you could go to a trade conference and look for manufacturers that way. I'm unfortunately not familiar with which trade conferences exist for this market, but I imagine there are a few. They're probably a bit pricey too.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

We have a lot of local services that have professional machines for pinging on almost all type of surface, mugs, t-shirts, pens. If I want some mugs created it does not metter what the purpose is, promotional or not. I just have to find some blank mugs (or use what they provide) and negotiate the quantity discounts. 

The local services have quite expensive machines, that I believe are the same machines that produce printed mugs in stores. So, there is no difference between "guys who print mugs for promotional uses" and "manufacturer".
