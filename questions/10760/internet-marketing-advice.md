1) Understand your target audience, who they are and where they are. Are there particular sites they congregate? Do they do a lot of online searching to find particular information? Where are they online?

2) Learn the tactics you can use to get to them and test if you can to understand ultimately the performance and the costs of customer acquisition. Be able to track and determine what it costs to get a visitor/user/customer...whatever specific action you're looking for, via the most likely tactics.

Good luck!

There are a couple of different ways to drive traffic, especially for a small to medium business. Articles,. Blogs, Tweets.  They can all generate some hits, the more you produce, the more you’ll find a match for your company in search engines. That said, don’t spam.  Make it meaningful.

There is a very good article on this very subject at the MSBC Business Center:
How to Maximize Productivity Today and Opportunities Tomorrow.

<p>Having content people want to read and then want to share is <strong><em>the</em></strong> single most important thing you can do.</p>

<p>Second - make it EASY to share. Use things like the "share this" button from <a href="http://www.addthis.com" rel="nofollow">Add This</a>. We're using it - easy for our members and visitors and we get great analytic tools, too. </p>

<p>Third - get feedback - ask your visitors and members what they like and don't like about your content. Use your blog and make sure they know you listened to them.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>All good suggestions so far, but keep in mind that there really isn't a way to "quickly" grow online traffic without spending money (or black hat SEO techniques). Inbound/content marketing can be very effective but it takes time to build an audience organically and generate traffic. There are no quick fixes without buying advertising.</p>

<p>The one exception to this is a viral marketing campaign. These are certainly not full-proof and difficult to pull off. There is an excellent article that discusses the variables involved and some very specific tips: <a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/lessons-learnt-viral-marketing/" rel="nofollow">Lessons Learned - Viral Marketing</a></p>
