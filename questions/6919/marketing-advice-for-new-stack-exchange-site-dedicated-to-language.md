I just launched a Stack Exchange site dedicated to language (grammar, etymology, translation, etc.). I have not really advertised it so far (apart from a [post on HN][1]).

Can you come up with some *original* marketing ideas for that type of site? I was thinking of running a small AdWords campaign and see if it works (but that isn't exactly original). My goal here is to get a couple of early adopters and grow the community from there.

<p>First of all use the power of the SO platform.</p>

<p>Create a set of questions that a lot of people are asking on google. That way you will figure high early on.</p>

<p>I have said it before but it's still a good way to create a good set of popular questions.</p>

<p>go to google suggest and type in words or sentences related to grammar.</p>

<p>I just did with Comma</p>

<p><img src="http://www.000fff.org/Public/comma.png" alt="Google Suggest" /></p>

<p>Then create a set of questions based on that and answer them. Should help you quickly gain some traction.</p>

<p>I would also launch a twitter account with grammer rule of the day or something along those lines. Something fun for people to subscribe to without it being too spammy.</p>

<p>Remember we are connecting more and more based on actual interest rather than marketing. So if you want to attract people be interesting.</p>

<p>Also see if you can get access to places like oDesk that have thousands of copywriters, editors etc. from all around the world.</p>

<p>And if you are doing doing podcast as also suggested find interesting things to talk about that is not necessarily about language but perhaps about people who work with language.</p>

<p>For instance check out Wordy.com they translate your blog posts within one and a half hour directly in your blog.</p>

The grammar girl has a podcast.  You should probably consider doing the same.
