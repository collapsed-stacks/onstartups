Does anyone have experience with a service that let you see how visitors use a website by showing mouse moves and clicks?

I see that clicktale.com is doing just that.

Any recommendation?

<p>I use <a href="http://crazyegg.com" rel="nofollow">Crazy Egg</a>. It only records clicks on various page elements though, not mouse movement.</p>
