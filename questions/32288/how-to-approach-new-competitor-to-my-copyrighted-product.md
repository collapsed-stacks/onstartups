I have an LLC and developed a copyrighted program that I sell online.  I frequently enter in various terms online and see how I'm doing in the search results vs. my competitors.

All of a sudden, I am seeing that a new competitor has appeared. I looked on the competitor's website and see that the competitor's program has some similarities to mine- and mine is copyrighted.  Not good.

I'm a lawyer, and I know that the lawyerly "cease and desist" letters don't really work.  I am looking to get out of my business and sell it for a small amount, as I have a full-time job that takes all of my time and is more profitable.

Any tips on how to approach the competitor? "I see that you're new in the marketplace- let's work out something together- FYI I have a copyright..."?

Also, I know that you can't approach other competitors and coordinate any response to the new competitor, but I know that my other competitors must not like this either.  

Thanks.

A copyright isn't going to prevent someone from selling a similar program or service.

If someone is infringing on a copyright, trademark or patent that you hold you can pursue action.  If they are simply offering a similar service, delivered on their own platform or mechanism, that is called "capitalism".

If you want to sell your company to them you should figure out a fair market value and then approach them with some kind of offer.

<p>As a lawyer, you should know that the copyright to your program <strong>only</strong> protects the source code to that product. It does not protect the look and feel of that program. Anyone can copy that unless you have a design patent, or they are infringing on a trademark of yours.</p>
