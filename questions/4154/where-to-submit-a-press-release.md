## Where to Submit a Press Release?

We have just launched our new website/service and I have written up a press release announcing that launch. My only problem is where exactly should I send this press release to? Are there any recommended business blogs that publish these sorts of things?? We are trying to focus on the online community for now.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks
NM

<p>Writing a press release, sending it out for distribution, and having it get picked up and written about are all separable (and important!) elements to doing this "right". If you have not actually done this before, I would recommend working with somebody who has some level of experience with this in tailoring your overall PR strategy. In any case, in direct answer to your question, three services that come to mind for sending out your press release for you include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.send2press.com/" rel="nofollow">Send2Press</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/" rel="nofollow">PR Newsire</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BusinessWire</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have no association with them, but if I had to recommend one of the above, getting a sense this is a new thing for you, I would probably suggest Send2Press as the best of the three for you. They are pretty cost effective and can provide quite a bit of value add in helping to make sure you are targeting things in a way that will really get picked up better. ie: If you just blast out your release to everyone, and the writers realize this, they tend to blow it off because they are looking for a hook and a unique (as possible) angle for themselves.</p>

Beware "freebie" places.  Usually they just spam it into spam blogs, which are not only not read by actual human beings (which is really the point), but can *negatively impact* your SEO.

In my experience "free" isn't worth it in the world of PR.

However, also "not free" isn't usually worth it either.  Actively pursuing reviews from real bloggers can have 100x the effect of putting something on a newswire.
