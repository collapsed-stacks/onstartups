<p>I want to make a product that is an improvement and very similar to an existing product. The product I want to make would also work with a part of the existing product.</p>

<p>How do I know where the line is drawn in regards to infringing on the patent of the existing product?</p>

<p>Ive seen a similar question asked about this topic but the answers didn't go into detail about the legal aspects of my question. Any help would be great, thanks</p>
