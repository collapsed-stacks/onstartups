Is there any example of succeeding at both starting and sustaining a successful business and a successful relationship simultaneously? Or, is it worth trying it?

It is difficult and the optimal is, when the partner is involved in the same business. Otherwise, you are going another way than your partner and that could be extremely hard. The exception is when you clearly accept your roles, for example the wife is taking care of children, and the man is doing business. 

If there is constant success, there are less struggles in family life as well. If there are obstacles in the business, for example wrong cash flow, then you will have struggles in family life as well. This can change in time. But when the partner ties are strong enough, nothing can separate them, not even badly made business.

Therefore your question is actually: "Is there anyone, who have strong ties in partnership/family life?" and business and start-ups is indifferent question. And for that question I should say: Yes, I do/have.

<p>I have no experience in this, but I am of the opinion that it would depend on the partner and you.</p>

<p>If they understand what you are doing and they support you and the idea, I think they can both work. But you also need to understand their needs and make time for them and the startup.</p>

<p>As an example, I would read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson" rel="nofollow">Richard Branson's</a> autobiography. I think it will also give you some insight into business and relationships.</p>
