I decided to sell my ebook on iTunes and searched for it. I read official [faq][1] and found out that I needed a US Tax ID (EIN, I think). Then, I searched for it and found out that I needed an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) to get EIN because I am not a resident. I don't know what will be next and how much it would cost eventually.

There are different prices for each and different procedures to follow. Is there anyone who passed through all these and give a brief summary about the procedure and cost?

If you're an individual, your tax ID is either SSN (social security number, available for all citizens and green-card holders, and some foreigners allowed to work in the US), or ITIN (available to all to whom SSN is not available). You should find an "ITIN Acceptance Agent" somewhere close to you (many US-licensed tax practitioners who live and work abroad may also serve as ITIN acceptance agents), and file an application through them. Otherwise, you can file the application directly with IRS.

EIN is for business entities or for individuals who're paying salaries to others, which you're not.
