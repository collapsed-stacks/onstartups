I have designed a prototype of my idea which includes simple **electronic circuits**. I would like to manufacture it in China. (yes ... because of the money)

I would like to know how it is to find a reliable **Chinese supplier**.
I need to know where to look for, how to make deals, should I do it personally or get a supply manager as a consultant to do it for me.

I am in the process of starting a business in Sweden, and this is my first time doing it.

I appreciate all the useful answers,

Thanks :)

I'd recommend looking for contacts on http://www.alibaba.com/
Users have feedback/reputation levels you can base your decisions on - and you can check with third parties to verify the credibility of any particular supplier.

<p>Perhaps the best way is to travel to China and meet with the factory owners. This is the approach that <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=282" rel="nofollow">Bunnie Huang</a> took when looking for suppliers for his startup: <a href="http://www.chumby.com/" rel="nofollow">Chumby</a>.</p>

I worked with many factories in China and even Pakistan. I've found quality can be very random even with the same company.

The fact is that alibaba.com is full of *agents*, or one man sales company that outsource to other factories. You have to go there to discover how they are organized. 

For electronics, **you must** have someone there that do a quality control check before good is charged on the ship. If there is a quality problem, it's very common to refuse the whole batch.

Conclusion: you will have to make lot of test and trial to find a suitable and stable partner, and if you can't afford to go there at the end of each production, you must hire a thursted agent.
