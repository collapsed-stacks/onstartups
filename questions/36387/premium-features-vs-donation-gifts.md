We are developing a freemium business model and have planned some Premium features that users can buy. What are the main differences between these two types of monetization:

1. **Premium model**: Buy a Foo or a Bar for 2.00€
2. **Donation model**: Donate 2.00€ and choose your preferred gift: a Foo or a Bar

Are users more tempted to **donate** or to actually **buy**? As per past experiences users see a higher benefit when buying something directly rather than donating and then choosing a gift.

What are your thoughts on this?

I'm not a big fan of the donation model unless you are a non-profit or an individual (e.g. artist on kickstarter or something like that).

For a for profit company, it's best to have people buy since it reduces confusions and as you point out, a customer will see a higher benefit. I also think they will be more likely to buy more from you.

I don't have any concrete data on that but a donate model implies that you are not a real business who wants real customers. 

You have to be crystal clear that you are in business to win customers and make money. Customers don't donate -- supporters donate. Customers tell you how to improve your product -- supporters feel good about getting a free gift and are not really invested in the products success.
