<p>For questions like this, my go-to source is usually glassdoor.com.</p>

<p>It looks like FB salaries are anywhere from $85K to $185K per year. Twitter looks like $84K to  $165K. I'll let you do the math from that, but somewhere on the order of $40/hour to $90/hour.</p>

<p>Both of those have vast ranges, and it no doubt depends on the level of experience of the developers and the location in which they live/work (cost of living). </p>
