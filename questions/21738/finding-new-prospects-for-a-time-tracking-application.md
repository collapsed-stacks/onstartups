What would be good strategies for finding prospect customers for a new time tracking and timesheet product/startup?   This could be both online and offline.   Let me know what your ideas are!

Thanks,

Etienne

You are entering a very crowded field.  Essentially that piece of software is a commodity at this point as there are many available free time tracking apps.

My advice would be to focus on one niche only (for example time tracking for psychologists who bill by the hour or accountants that work from home).

As far as how do you market to them, there isn't going to be an easy answer on the internet :)
You could try google adwords.  You could participate in the communities where these people hang out and passively mention your application.  You could advertise at conferences, etc.

I agree with Michael. When I was choosing which time tracking tool to use, I was surprised with how many there are today. 

My advice would be to focus on a specific audience first because they'll be easier to tap. Once you have the word out, you can then venture on a wider audience.

If you are having problems on identifying a product and its audience, pricing, launching, marketing, etc, there is an online class 30x500 that will help you go through with all of these. This class is handled by Amy Hoy, who incidentally is one of the creators of Freckle time tracking. If you're interested, check out her website at http://unicornfree.com/.
