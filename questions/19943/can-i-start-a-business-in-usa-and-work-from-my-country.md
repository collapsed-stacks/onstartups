Can I incorporate a business in USA and work from my country? Can I receive profit from my corp even when I'm not an employee, only director? I have a b1b2 visa. Is this enough to manage a business from my country and only receive profits but not salary??

The answer is "yes", you can start a business in the USA and work from your country. Citizenship is not necessarily a requirement. The business is considered a "foreign corporation" and in all of the states I have looked at, it is the same as starting a corporation outside of the state you live in. That is, if I live in Nebraska and start a corporation in Arizona, I am a "foreign corporation" in Arizona.

Besides the usual paperwork for incorporation, you will need a "registered agent" that will serve as your business address to receive official documents, legal summons, etc.

There are a number of services (like http://www.myllc.com) that will help you with incorporating. Many of these services will also provide a registered agent for an annual fee. (Note: I am not endorsing this company, it's just the first one I found in google.)

You can also hire a lawyer to get you set up, but this will no doubt be expensive.

However, as a corporation, you will need to make sure that you do all of the recurring things that are legally required. It depends upon the type of corporation, but this will include things like a corporate minutes, filing income tax, and so on.

Yes, you can form a corporation here and manage it from a foreign country. I have helped ~30 foreign clients start up businesses in the U.S., and many have done exactly what you want to do. A major reason for forming a corporation here - aside from attractiveness to prospective U.S.-based customers - is to create a legal firewall to keep any liabilities here away from the foreign owner.

I have blogged extensively on issues for foreign companies and entrepreneurs starting up in the U.S. I recommend that you start with my blog's Foreign Countries page (http://danashultz.com/blog/foreign-countries/) and follow the various links from there.
