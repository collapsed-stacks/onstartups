Some tradeshows propose a "put your flyer in visitor's bag" option.

We are currently considering buying it for a product launch, but I am wondering if this is worth the money ?

What experience do you have with this kind of things ?

How do you measure the success ?
I could measure the change in visits on the website, but how could I know there are due to our talk at the event, our booth or the flyer in the bag... ?

just my previous experience, no actual research behind this.

Your flyer will actually be seen by 2-20 people in 100. The 2-20 depends on flyer quality, uniqueness, the type of people at the convention. How many that view the flyer and become a client is not a part of the equation I know, but hopefully you can make an educated guess.

So if the cost of the flyer is worth 2 in 100 viewing it, based on your sales conversion estimate, then go for it. If not, but it is worth it if 20 out of 100 really look at it, then that depends on how good at marketing you are.

As for measuring success there are tons of ways to do that. Picking the right one would depend on what you consider success. 20 client, 100, 1000, etc.

You can measure it by having a bring-this-card-to-our-booth-and-go-in-the-draw-for-a-<shiny gimmick> promotion. You will see people walk directly to your booth if the giveaway is good (e.g. an iPad). You will get some word-of-mouth amongst the attendees if you have a good giveaway.

I would suggest that you bring your flyer to the booth and let people pick it up or ask for it.  This cuts down on waste b/c only the people that want it, take it.

First of all, flayers are dead. Nobody really wants a piece of paper. You should give something useful, creative, funny, memorable etc. 

Speaking from my own experience, at the last trade show we offered a little skit about the world economic crisis and a letter: "weâ€™d like to share with you a first skit which, through its humor, will relieve some of the daily stress while at the same time helping decipher what, how, who, with respect to the Great Recession.

As a measurement, at the end of the skit, in-staid of our site, we put a unique link specially created for the skit and the trade show (example www.company.com/skit-trade or a blog link etc.), meaning that the people accessing that link come only from the trade (we did not give that skit to other people). 

It was a success!

Normally when you spend money to be a vendor in many tradeshows that organizers won't charge extra for that.

If you are considering printing cost, that's pretty much nothing, so do it.

If you need to pay certain price to put your flyer on there, without giving us the cost and attendee numbers I don't think it's easy to say something.
