Please help. I'll make this as simple and concise as possible:

I will be manufacturing my own parts, AT HOME, in South Carolina. I intend to sell the products exclusively online with an online storefront. I will be shipping them from SC.

I am considering getting a Wyoming LLC because of the lack of business tax, lack of an annual licensing fee, free certificates of good standing, legal protection due to anonymity, etc.

My bank accounts will most likely be located in South Carolina. Perhaps if I located them in Wyoming this would circumvent legalities that profile where the 'majority of a business is located' based on transactions?


Is this legal since I am not physically conducting any business in SC; merely manufacturing parts? What are the pros/cons of this method?

Thank you!

If you are manufacturing parts in SC and shipping parts from SC, it sure sounds like you're going to be conducting business in SC.  So, you'll have to register as a foreign LLC and do things like pay taxes, etc....  And that just about eliminates any benefit you'd have from being a Wyoming LLC.

I'm not familiar with either SC or Wyoming LLC law -- there may be reasons to choose one over the other.  But, in general, trying to avoid taxes in your home state isn't going to work.

Nothing of this will help you. Since you're operating in SC - you'll **have to** register in SC. So whatever benefits you think you'd be getting from registering in Wyoming - they're all moot, because you're still going to register in SC as well. It will just cost you more (registered agent in WY, maintaining address there, filing whatever paperwork they require to maintain status, etc).

From what you wrote, your whole business is in SC. What's "merely manufacturing parts", and how it is not "conducting any business"?
