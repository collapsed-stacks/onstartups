I am working on an Android and an iPhone application. I was hoping to support these applications with advertisements. However, I want to get paid based on the number of ad impressions that appear. But, I only see cost-per-click networks for these devices. Am I missing something? 

Does anyone know of any pay-per-impression ad networks for iphone/android apps?

Thanks!

<p><a href="http://www.airpush.com" rel="nofollow">Airpush</a> pays out on a CPM basis and is averaging over $3 CPM's.  Those are push notification ads, though, and not in-app ads.</p>
