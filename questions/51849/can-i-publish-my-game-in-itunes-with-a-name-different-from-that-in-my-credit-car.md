<p>I would like to purchase an iOS developer account from apple. My credit card name is: <code>ABCD</code>. And I am going to purchase the developer account with the same credit card as an Individual account(since there is no chance for me to register it as a company right now). And I know while publishing to the iTunes store, my apps will group under the name <code>ABCD</code>.</p>

<p>So, my question is:</p>

<p>Can I publish my game in iTunes with a name different (eg: <code>CDEF</code>) from my credit card (ie.: <code>ABCD</code>)?</p>

<p>Please tell me any solution to do this, if any. Every suggestions are valuable.</p>

<p>This question would be best put to apple support!</p>

<p>Although, when I started my company, before I got my business account cards, I used my personal accounts, which were in my personal name rather than my trading as name, to buy/sell/rent services and never had an issue.</p>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong>
You can publish the game under a different 'brand' name than your credit card name.</p>

<p>We have a number of accounts under different brand names - which have nothing to do with our actual real names on credit cards.</p>
