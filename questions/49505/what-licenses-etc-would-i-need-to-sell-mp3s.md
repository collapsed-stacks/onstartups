I am looking to start a website selling a niche market of mp3s. These are **not** my own work and are commercially available elsewhere. (Highly scaled down version of itunes, amazon mp3, beatport etc). How would I go about obtaining the rights/paying royalties to do this? Is it a ,after of contacting record labels individually or is there another way? I am based in the UK but would be selling worldwide.

Thanks in advance for any help.

You would need to identify who owns the electronic rights to each mp3 and negotiate for the right to sell them on your site. **This will not be easy to do.** Just identifying who owns the rights to a song can be a major task, and the rights holder may not be interested in talking to you.
