my partner and I are looking for a 3rd business partner who can run our Marketing (SEO/SEM). Is there a good resource out there that can find these sort of people? Any pitfalls to watch out for?

This is the site that they would assist in (redesign coming in a few weeks!)

Thanks!

Maybe start with what makes a solid marketing partner.

By defining what this person looks like to you could find it easier to attract them.

The nice thing about your site is that you have one! I would thing about getting someone on board from your customer base. Since they are at your site, like it and are contributing they could be the right person you thought of above.

I would say this is like any other hire where something like 80% of jobs are found through networking. Work your network (including this site) to find recommended candidates. I have an awesome candidate that may or may not be interested. I can mention this to him if you like.

But to your point, the pitfalls are hiring someone that you or your network doesn't know. They may sound great in person, resume may look great but recommendations from people you trust are the best scenario.

Best,

<p>You could also consider outsourcing this work on <a href="http://odesk.com" rel="nofollow">oDesk</a>.
The less skilled SEO/SEM people charge $2/hr for what appears to be black hat SEO.
However, I believe if you pay $10 or more per hour, you can get some very experienced workers to help you.</p>

<p>I would consider this option first, because it is far less expensive than finding a new partner, and will also give you a sense more quickly of the impact of good SEO + SEM.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/marketplace" rel="nofollow">SEOMoz's marketplace</a> - perhaps there is a local member that you can contact.  Rustybrick is pretty good.</p>
