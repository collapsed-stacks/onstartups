So I friend of mine has this idea for a kind of social network based on video blogging, for obvious reasons I can't talk a lot about it. Here's the thing, we are four in the team: 3 programmers and him (the idea guy). 

At first I was like yeah sure this sounds like a good thing, let's give it a try but, now I'm really passionate with what we can accomplished with the site and of all 3 programmers and kind of the leader now. The thing is...this guy is giving us WAY to little share (up to 10% each one) and I'm saying to him that there's NO way I'm gonna feel motivated with that little percent, specially since I'm beginning to see that he is just pressuring us and nothing more, he add nothing to the table whatsoever, just the "idea".

So...how much equity you think we should have? I was thinking something 20% each and 40% for him, I really don't know anything about this. The only thing I know if that I could build this website on my own in like 2 months or something and I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time. Geez and even starting to think to just do the website on their backs (for me the other two programmers are really bad).


Anyway, any suggestions??
Thanks a lot!
