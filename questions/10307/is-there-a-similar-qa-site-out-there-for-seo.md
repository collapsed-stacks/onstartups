Digitalpoint is terrific.

I also downloaded the ebook at increasing-traffic.com .  It was basic, but did have lots of helpful ideas that I hadn't seen elsewhere.

WebmasterWorld.com is probably the most respected and has really high quality discussions.

Also be sure to keep up on Aaron Wall's blog, SEOBook.com .

I like SEOmoz.org as well, but pro membership is $100/month with a 30 day trial. I like their free http://www.opensiteexplorer.org for checking backlinks and MozRank (alternative to page rank that updates about once a month).

I also just discovered woorank.com (found it on another post on this site), like what I see.
