I completed a website for a client earlier this year. They are requesting additions to the site, and currently I'm quite busy. I thanked my client for her patience, and explained to her that I'm a little busy right now and it would be a few more days, and that business is picking up and I'm still just a one person operation. Was this the best way to go about a reply? I'm not asking if it's better to lie, just looking for an alternative answer in case this happens in the future, which it probably will.

This is not bad. It adds value to your work (many wants your service, so you are busy but still responsible) as long as these delays are in acceptable range for your customers and you schedule to meet their requests in-time and tell them in soft words.
