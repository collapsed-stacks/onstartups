This question seems to get asked a lot, usually with the qualifier that it is only the *typical* documents or *standard* terms. But the reality is that there is no standard... each organization is different. Even when lawyers operate off of precedents (as they do in practically all circumstances), each set of precedents needs to be modified to the particular needs of the company, including diverse capitalization requirements, vesting, governance, tax strategies, IP assignment, liability, indemnification and other matters. Plus, you don't know what the founders want until you discuss it with them, and they have rarely, if ever, thought through all the issues in advance. A good lawyer isn't just preparing the documents, but is thinking through and researching any issues that come up in relation to a particular set of founder's circumstances.

My experience is that in 95% of cases it takes me 5-10 hours to draft the various documents and review to make sure everything is in order. That is separate from any time spent on consultation, organization and research of issues. In the other 5% of cases it  it is more than 10 hours... and sometimes much more if a client has very particular circumstances.

I'll second David Raynor's comments, but note that the time for the attorney to prepare the documents isn't the only relevant time.  The relevant documents need to be filed with the relevant Secretary(/ies) of State, documents and stock certificates need to be signed, etc...

The fastest I've ever been able to accomplish all that was 2 days, but it cost extra because of all the fees to expedite filing, get a corporate seal, etc....   A week is more typical, but it can be longer depending on how backed up your state's Secretary of State is (California, for example, takes about 3 weeks just for the filing.)
