I have just learned about this service: http://www.prweb.com/

I have a product which is targeted at people living in Toronto, Canada who are looking for homes. I'm thinking of using this service for our public launch which is soon and was wondering if anyone has experience using it and what their results were.

Thank you in advance,

Rokham Fard

I agree with Giles - it's worth the few bucks for the additional SEO work, but don't expect it to actually generate any media coverage.

If you really want to generate buzz for your launch, I'd recommend contracting a good PR firm and actually hiring someone to help with that. Their relationships with publications and editors will help you gain additional coverage.

Side-tip: If you're a new startup in Toronto, reach out to the folks at Sprouter.com and see if they'd be interested in featuring you, also check out RedCanary.ca - they're often featuring local tech startups, and finally, if your product is really good, drop a link to Ian Portsmouth at Profit Magazine, they also cover startup stuff regularly.

We've used them for press releases in the past.  They certainly get published, and do appear in various useful places, but don't expect miracles.  I'd say it's worth the $200 or so that a release costs just for the Google juice, so long as you make sure that your site is mentioned enough with appropriate keywords and links to appropriate pages.

(It's probably worth noting that we target a global market with computer software -- so your more local focus might make things either better or worse for you!)
