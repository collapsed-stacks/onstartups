Hey everyone... i have been spending the past 30 minutes trying to find real statistics from any time in the past three years.

I am simply trying to find a breakdown by age group of female shoppers online, along with the total market size.

Yes I know this is probably something large like 60 MM or so, but I would like to find the exact number. ( i mean come on this is stack exchange)

thanks.

<p>I think this gets you started roughly 50% for each gender and 36 billion as of ending 2007 quarter.  Pew didn't answer frequency of use so the 50% is going to be off but I think it is an indicator of use that if you get nothing else should be used.</p>

Sorry to disappoint, but those statistics do not exist.

In order for them to exist, every on-line eCommerce firm would have to co-operate in gathering and sharing this data.

Age data is not collected when doing most on-line purchases and gender data can at best be inferred from a name on the credit card.
