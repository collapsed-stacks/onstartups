Are there any good boards for software-related jobs- preferably free?  I am trying to find a software marketer; it's either Craigslist (resulting in hundreds of non-targeted emails/resumes) or a paid job board.

Any free job boards that might do the trick? Preferably NY-area, but doesn't have to be location-specific.

Thank you!

Check out AuthenticJobs.com.  It's NOT free - but hot damn - do you get good people.
