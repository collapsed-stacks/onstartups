We're looking for advice and opinions on economic, effective ways to convert existing users from free to paid subscriptions.  Our SaaS product is a slight twist to the traditional freemium model: "buyers" use the system for free and "require" their suppliers to enroll and conduct business with them; "suppliers" use the system (basic) for free, but can upgrade to a premium account for a nominal annual subscription fee.  Our market research indicates that "supplier" users want the features available to premium subscribers, and our price is almost an order-of-magnitude lower than the competitors.

Our concern is: how do we quickly, effectively monetize our application?  Is outsourcing lead generation an option, and if so, how should we get started with this?  What about email campaigns, or webinars?

<p>Have a listen to <a href="http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-startups/this-week-in-startups-101-phil-libin-founder-of-evernote-com/" rel="nofollow">this week in startups discussion</a> with Phil Libin, the guy who started evernote.</p>

<p>Key points I got from it.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the first month 0.5% of people will pay, after 2 years 20% will pay.</li>
<li>Most pay simply because they like the product and want it to continue.</li>
<li>Some need the advanced features, in their case storing to many PDFs cost to much so they charged for it. The clients understood that and were fine with it.</li>
<li>The free version should be the version you add the features to, premium features should actually be only those that apply to specific subsets of your market.</li>
<li>Don't stick a whole bunch of features in premium and cripple the free, you will loose too many people through bad feelings.</li>
</ol>

<p>So if you have the money to sustain it, this was their recommendation for getting a massive audience.</p>

You guys have good ideas, I don't know if there is any low hanging fruit you haven't already though of. But:

 - Set the feature set of Free so low that it is usable but rather painfully limited.
 - Offer Premium features for free for (30, 60, 90) days after account creation as an appetizer.
 - During trial periods / just after signup, send out "how to" emails and/or links to "how to" video tutorials that showcase how to get the most value out of your app (including relevant showcasing of Premium features).

I do think there is a tension between revenue from early stage customers and word of mouth referrals. Intuitively {good app, and it's free!} should get more word of mouth advertisement than {good app, but it also costs a pretty penny!}.
