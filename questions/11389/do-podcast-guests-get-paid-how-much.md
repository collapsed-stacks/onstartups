I listen to many podcasts. I sometimes wonder if guests get paid to appear in shows like on Leo Laporte's [TWiT][1] and John C. Dvorak's [CrankyGeek][2]. Like how much? Maybe not the one off guests. What about co-hosts like Amber McArthur on Twit's Net@Night?

There are a million different podcasts out there so I can only speak to the ones in the spaces I've been involved with. Guests don't receive compensation. Typically they're selling something - representing a company, selling books, pimping their own podcast. Some aspire to be seen as experts or influencers in a particular space so make the rounds based on building that up. 

Co-hosts are a different situation. There has to be some exchange of value for their time/expertise.
