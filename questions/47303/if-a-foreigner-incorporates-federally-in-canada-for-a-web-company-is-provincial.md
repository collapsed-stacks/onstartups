If a foreigner wants to incorporate in Canada for a web startup which will have no actual physical presence in Canada (except for the required director), does he have to also register (and pay taxes) in any province? If he doesn't, is it still possible for him do open a bank account, or would where ever he opens the bank account be considered the province where he is doing business?

TIA
