A wealth individual would like to invest into a project where he would provide the funds and I would provide the management of the project. However, I am not too sure of the correct procedure to start and follow.

what is the step by step procedure such projects follow? (this project is not a small project by any means)

Financially I am very much tied up until some money is released where I can efficiently function. He has asked me for a letter of intent as a start. Assuming I prepare the LoI and send - Then what?

what is the step by step procedures to follow?
thanks.

The LOI only formalizes the venture that you and the investor will launch. The next step is the signing of the actual contract that will closely replicate the LOI.  The LOI should lay out any revenue or payment agreements as well as your role in the company.  If you are expecting some type of salary then have an employment agreement added to the contract documents.
