The Startup Weekend site recommends "[laptop, power cord, business cards, camera, a second monitor, keyboard, and lots of creative energy!](http://startupweekend.org/firsttimer/)"  Danielle Morrill suggests bringing [internet connectivity for when the wireless doesn't work](http://startupweekend.org/2009/08/29/thoughts-on-making-the-most-of-startup-weekend-by-danielle-morrill/).  Tristan Kromer says ["bring fruit"](http://twitter.com/TriKro/status/73354874250731520). What else?

I am not sure I understand you question and what Startup Weekend is, but you just need essential things and some laptop to work on. Important is what you do, not what tools you have.
