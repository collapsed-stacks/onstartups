inspired by hubspot, we're dedicated to creating more remarkable content. we think it can be engaging and relevant for our customers. we feel mass-customized apparel is an area that doesn't have that much thought-leadership, just a bunch of companies selling the product, a handful of bloggers writing about it.

the question relates to whether to create a separate site for it, think inboundmarketing.com, or to build it under our current e-commerce site. the reason why we might have it in a separate url is because we want to create and discuss content that is beyond just the product we sell, but about the entire product area. e.g. instead of inboundmarketing.com just talking about what hubspot does about inbound marketing, it develops a thought-leadership in the entire area.

of course at the end of the day, there is SEO authority to consider, user friction, what's going to help build a better brand, get more leads and ultimately more sales?

Create it on your current site in a /blog directory and/or using blog as the subdomain, e.g.: //blog.domainname 

You WANT people to know about your thoughts and ideas, whether they pertain to your product or not. Your blog is your way to put "you" behind your product. If people like what you say and how you think, that will translate into them being more confident in buying your product.

However, if you want to post radical statements on politics or religion, etc., you might want to reconsider where you post those.

Post it on a subfolder, not a subdomain. Rand from SEOmoz had some good info on that in the last whiteboard friday. http://www.seomoz.org/blog/mixing-viral-content-with-business-content-whiteboard-friday

Speaking of SEOmoz it might also serve as a good example for this. They have their blog on a subfolder and don't just talk about the software they sell on that blog but rather cover a wide variety of online marketing topics like UX, conversion, tracking, writing, etc. besides just covering SEO
