I have a decade experience in software developement and specially web related applications. As a geek, I have a nice contacts but I do not see any of my contact turning into a perspective client. Recently I got an offer to incubate a small consulting firm inside another bigger firm. My firm will work in a specific niche. Say Mobile development consulting. 

As of now I do not have any client and am dependent upon the various lead generation tools available on web. 

My question is, I have heard bigger consulting firms do subcontracting, is there any specific process of becoming a subcontractors. And is this the right path to get into consulting business when we have bigger giants ruling.

<p>Being a subcontractor just means you're not the prime contractor, nothing more nothing less - so no, there's nothing special about it. That said, some very large contracts require that a percent of the contract be subcontracted to disadvantaged business enterprises. On the other end of the spectrum, some contracts forbid subcontractors.</p>

<p>As for getting subcontracts, just find the people who have the primes, find out who writes the proposals, management the projects, handles outsources, etc. -- and make contact in a meaningful way to them; really depends on your pitch, meaning you're able to do something they can't, are a disadvantaged business enterprise, etc.</p>

<p>Honestly most bizdev on subcontracts comes down to building relationships, but professionally speaking, this is one of many great books on doing business development as a consultant, "<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1558504206" rel="nofollow">Rain Making: The Professional's Guide to Attracting New Clients</a>".</p>

Seems like you dont have any expeirence in sales. If you start consulting co you would need to do sales. Get yourself comfortable with that. 

I think for consulting most important is to start building relationships. Try doing first projects really, really free and make sure people are happy about your results. Then start asking for recommendations. Then you can start slowly increasing the price.

Hope it helps
Mark
