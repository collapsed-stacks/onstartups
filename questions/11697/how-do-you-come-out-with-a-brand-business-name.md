Think of a word. Do a Google search. Get mad when you find it. Repeat until you are so tired of doing this, then someone will throw out a suggestion. You're too tired to fight, so you go with it.

1. Make a list of words that relate to your target audience, your information process, your product, your brand values.

2. Search synonyms and antonyms in the thesaurus to populate the list further.  
3. Most important, create a unique name, if the words you came up with are not unique try a combination of two otherwise unrelated words, or a play on meaning. Like paypal, Etsy, ebay, odesk, or onstartups.
4. Search whether such a name exists or has other meanings that you have not thought of before. Know a company which wanted to name itself modelsheet and found out after incorporating that modelsheets are used in the cartoon industry. 
3. If the name you came up with exists, if so, repeat from step 1.

Another thing to mention is to make sure that whatever name you come up with is available as a domain. You can use http://www.whois.net/ to do a domain lookup to see if the domain is available or not. It is best to keep the name unique but fairly simple so the domain name can be easily remembered.

One other recommendation that I have is not to rush the process. Brainstorming is great, get a huge list of ideas and do some research on all of them. However, sometimes the best ideas will just spring into your head unexpectedly.

I belive it should be a simple and memorable name that's derived from the reason why you are starting you business. I think the brand name should also be a synonym of the void that your product or service is trying to fill in the market or it could be a word or name that the traget market all have in common.

First, you need to make sure that no one else is using your brand/business name.  A simple search on Google, and through your State Department of Revenue, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark sites will answer that for you easily enough.

Secondly, as others have said, make it memorable.  If you are going to use a website to promote your business you'll want something to make it stand out from competitors.

This subject was actually discussed at the Microsoft Small Business Summit.  If you're interested in watching the video of that discussion, I'll attach a link.

Coming up with a good, unique name is hard. Even if you're locally focused, you're trying to extract something globally unique. We spent a lot of time googling potential names. Most of the good, descriptive names are taken; even in specialty markets.

It should be easier if your primary audience speaks something other than English. 

This is the impetus behind the current trend of using invented words as company names; e.g. Nozbe. 

In the end, we settled on Saltwater Satori. It's descriptive, has a certain panache due to its Buddhist connection, but only a few people immediately know what satori means. So, it's not perfect, but it will be good enough to build on.

Keep is short and simple, something catchy and also describes what the company is all about.

<p>I am quoting <a href="http://www.liquidagency.com/zagbook/" rel="nofollow">Zag</a> by Marty Neumeier here, page 85:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A name should be: <br />
   1. Different than those of competitors<br />
   2. Brief - four syllables or less<br />
   3. Appropriate, but not so descriptive that it sounds generic<br />
   4. Easy to spell<br />
   5. Satisfying to pronounce<br />
   6. Suitable for "brandplay" (e.g. you can use the name as a verb, rather than a noun)<br />
   7. Legally defensible (i.e. it's unique and not too similar to the competition) <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course you want to grab the domain name to match!</p>
