I intend to sell small banner ads as well as job ads on my site. The job ads I'm less worried about because I can look at similar publications, get their rate cards and price myself according to my traffic. I have no idea on where to even begin pricing banner ad spots. 

I have read about some of the terms, but whenever I try to find numbers, real numbers not just % change over the last year, the author is usually trying to sell me their service. 

Where can I find objective data and information for how to price banner ads? 

My inclination is to go by Page Views which I think translates to CPM?

<p>take a look at advertising on facebook, and google. You do not actually have to advertise with them but you can get a feel for how much they charge. Facebook recommends around $.30-$.50 per thousand impressions (CPM)</p>

<p>Other ways to do it is charge per month which is what a lot of sites do. you can take a look at <a href="http://buysellads.com/" rel="nofollow">buysellads</a> to get some ideas about what people are charging.</p>
