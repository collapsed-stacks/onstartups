I own a US based company that imports clothing from Italy for resale in the US. I recently set up a subsidiary in Japan to sell my products there. What is the best way to account for inventory at the Japan subsidiary level? Should the Japanese subsidiary buy its inventory directly from the Italian suppliers (whom also sell to the US parent) or should the US parent buy the inventory and resell it to the Japanese subsidiary at cost? i.e. is it advisable for the Japanese subsidiary to have one vendor/supplier (its parent) or multiple ones on the balance sheet? 

Any recommendations/pitfalls of each approach? Which is best and why?

Thanks
