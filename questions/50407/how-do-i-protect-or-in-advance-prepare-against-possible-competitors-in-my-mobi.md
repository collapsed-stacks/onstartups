Recently, I have taken the project of building a business in which, in my country, there are 800 types of businesses that offer the same product but none to your house service. These are "competitors" directly but seeing as I am the only one who is doing it as a home service, I have a somewhat in concept close to a competitive advantage.

How do I prepare or protect my change in the business process? I would also like to add that there are independent mechanics who offer the same service, but their trust is limited as we all know mechanics are, in terms of reputation, worse or close to lawyers (the bad ones of course).

There's no way you can patent something like this as it's really very generic, so your best approach is to use a distinctive brand and be extremely good at what you do. That way you can create significant distance between yourself and competitors based on brand recognition and trust.
