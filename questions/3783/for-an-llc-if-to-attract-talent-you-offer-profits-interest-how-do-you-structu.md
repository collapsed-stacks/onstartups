For an LLC...say if the value fo the startupfirm is $10M, so now to attract key new talent you offer profits interest (seems to be the popular choice for an LLC, right?)...now do you offer profits Interest on the value of the startup as it currently values ($10M) or on the incremental value (from $10M onwards to exit value)...since these new employees will influence only what happens now onwards.

Why not just offer shares and base the profit sharing on the shares someone has. So, someone that has been there longer should have a higher percentage, so should get more.

Keeping track of what the value was when someone was hired, and what it is now, may lead to arguments and a book-keeping nightmare.

Profits interests are granted on the "profits" of the LLC, not on the "capital" of the LLC. Here's an example:

- "Capital" Interest

If your LLC is worth 10 Million, and you give someone a 10% "capital" interest in the LLC, then the person owns 10% of the LLC. If the LLC is liquidated, they get 1 million when you grant the capital interest.

- "Profits" or "Carried" Interest

If your LLC is worth 10 million and you give someone a 10% "profits" interest (also called carried interest), it is not worth anything when you give it to them. Let's say the LLC makes 5 million that year. The 10% "profits" interest is worth 500k for that year only.

The point here is that the profits interest isn't valued at anything when it's granted, only at the end of the year when the profits are determined.
