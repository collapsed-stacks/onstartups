I run a small tech company providing custom web development (in Ontario, Canada), and I have a few clients.  However, as I am still a student in university, I have co-op positions that I take every couple months.  Now, some of the contracts I sign claim IP for anything I do during my time at the company, at work OR at home.  That is all well and good normally, but my question arises when I wonder about my company's IP.  

Basically, if I do work for a company as a "day job" and I sign over IP of anything I do during that time, does that apply for things I do for my company as well, or does my company still own that IP?  I am a little hazy on the laws regarding this subject, so if someone could clear that up it would be great.  Thanks!

<p>This is discussed in other places, including <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/120765/how-strict-are-standard-employer-ip-agreements-about-coding-outside-of-work">here</a>.</p>

<p>Your first action should always be to ensure that your employer is OK with you doing this outside work. Unless you are doing work that is competitive with what your employer does, most companies are. But it's much better to get their agreement - in writing - up front than to rely on proving that the contract you signed doesn't apply in your case. Even if you can prove it later, you'll end up spending money on lawyers, and forever killing your chances of employment with that company.</p>
