I'm trying out a new product where race directors put a widget on their site which gives them access to the mapping data on my site and I'm setting up my contract.

I'm considering whether the contract should include wording requiring attribution on some page which includes a link back to my site - i.e. for my SEO.

I'm not sure if I should do this because it feels a little...mean?

It may not be required because the way the widget is setup is with progressive enhancement. Without Javascript you get a link to the map on my site wrapped around a static image. Once the widget code loads it gets replaced with the Google Map and there's an added link added to the copyright div on that that goes back to my site. I'm hoping that Google's crawler will make good sense of that but I'm not sure.

You might as well try to get as much free advertising as possible. Why not offer two options:

Option 1, the website must include the phrase "maps provided by XYZ" whenre XYZ is the name of your company and has a link back to your site.

Option 2, The website can opt for an extra cost premium service where they are not required to include the above phrase.

This should make everyone happy.
