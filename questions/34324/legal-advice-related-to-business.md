I am looking for legal advice related to business. Are there any websites, groups, phonelines, etc within the US that provide free or very low cost legal reference advice?

I personally do most of my legal research, but often advice from legal subject matter experts is a huge time saver. Unfortunately, I don't have the budget to be retaining formal legal advice.

I have never used this website personally but Avvo.com might be what you are looking for:

http://www.avvo.com/

I have also used a local lawyer who gives a hour free consultation via the local SCORE office. You might be able to do the same. I plan on using this lawyer later on as well to make his time worth it.
