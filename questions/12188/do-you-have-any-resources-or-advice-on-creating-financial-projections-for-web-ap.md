I would love some resources, articles, best practices, formulas, examples, or advice on creating financial projections & models for web-based applications. I've found some online, though many reference advertising models. Ad models are fine & will be considered as part of the overall projections, but I'm especially interested in guidance on freemium models. In case this matters, this is for a B2B app.

FYI, here are some of the better articles I've found so far:

 * http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/scenarios.html
 * http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/10/financial-model.html
 * http://andrewchen.typepad.com/andrew_chens_blog/2008/04/how-not-to-calc.html

Thanks!

Information Rules from Harvard Business School Press
http://www.amazon.com/Information-Rules-Strategic-Network-Economy/dp/087584863X

covers the economist perspective on information based products like web 2.0 apps.  Great resource and talks through managing lock-in, versioning information, pricing waging a standards war and the cost of producing information.
