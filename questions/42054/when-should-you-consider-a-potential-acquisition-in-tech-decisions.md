In the early stages, the consensus in advice seems to be:

- Building an MVP: Use whatever is quickest.
- After you've got product market fit: Use whatever the team knows best/is best for the medium to long term.

But at what point do you start to consider potential acquisitions? Not necessarily a single company, but should you avoid using an (relatively) obscure language that would be slightly quicker in favour of a tried and trusted language that you know a lot of the big companies that may one day buy you use?

There has to be a point when this comes in to consideration, when would it be for you?

Make decisions based on information you have available to you now.  Choosing technology based on what a big company that may buy you one day would be a mistake.

Even at the simplest level, you don't know what technology big companies will be using in 2 years time, it would suck to have made big decisions based on what they use now.

There are a lot more reasons not to do this, but really it comes down to the fact that things change.  Don't base important decisions on what might be in a few years, just choose the right technology to achieve your goals in the next few months... anything further ahead than that is just guessing.
