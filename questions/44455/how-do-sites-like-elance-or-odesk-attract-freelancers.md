In order to attract the developers you must have projects for them. In order to have projects for them, you must have developers. Ha?!?

Here's what I would do: figure out the niche for your site. Is it for designers, software developers, copy writers etc? 

For example: if you take on software developers, don't make it for all of them. Start as a freelance site for iOS (maybe android as well) start promoting the site as a iOS freelancer hub. One of the first projects you can publish could be a simple iOS app of your site - just to break the ice.

Since you need buyers as well, at the same time go around and make lists of software companies that need iOS developers (development agencies, design agencies, marketing agencies, startups and ask them to signup for free).

That's what I would do. It does not have to be correct approach and you should not take it as such :) its just an idea!

In my opinion a good way to attract freelancers to join your site is to promote your site on different forums, blogs, social media and etc that is related to your niche. It can help you look for freelancers that are interested to join your site. Another thing you need to do is look for clients that are looking for freelancers so that freelancers would sign up to your site to work for clients.
