My site currently uses Volusion live chat but honestly, it sucks, since I need to run the tool and sit in front of it all day long. I'd like something more mobile where I can respond to chat inquiries from anywhere. 

Google Talk has an official chatback badge but it would be nice to have something a little more...professional? 

I'm not big enough to need multi user support or anything. I'm all by my lonesome :)

<p><strong>Yes, <a href="http://www.olark.com/" rel="nofollow">Olark chat</strong> is a common website chat</a> choice for startups. It uses the open Jabber/XMPP protocol on the backend, which means that pretty much any multifunction instant messaging client can work with it. Some examples a GTalk, Trillian, Pidgin for the PC, and there will be several choices for mobile phones (iPhone, Android) as well. Olark itself is a SaaS startup, and the Olark chat is added to a website by adding their hosted Javascript files.</p>

Gtalk is XMPP, so you need a web based XMPP client.

A quick search found this: http://jaxl.im/

I do not know of an live customer support tool which integrates with an current IM platform. I do know that there are those that have a blend of platform options that free you from sitting in front of your computer.

Our company's live chat platform has both an Android and iPhone Application which allows you to be logged onto your site's live customer chat from your smart phone where ever you are. Both can run in the background. I have had Google talk, the IM aggregate "trillian" and our live customer support tool all running on my phone at the same time with no problem. 

*Warning*:  the option of being available at all times anywhere has signifant costs to personal relationships.

I came across plupper a while back, seemed to be decent, have recommended it a few times and haven't had any negative come-backs. And it's free for a single user account. Give it a whirl.

Go for Livezilla, its free chat application which is similar to Live Person but they have not yet released any version for mobile. But its best option as the software is too good.
