I apologize in advance to smart, experienced tech entrepreneurs if the question is absurd, I'm just trying to get where you are and you have to start somewhere.  I have an idea for a website that could generate a decent amount of traffic (~ 1000 uniques a day lets say) and it would have virtually zero overhead costs (estimated $100/month), but the problem is I don't have a business model for it.  Can I just slap ads on it and expect to recoup my monthly costs and then some?  Other advice?

Thanks so much in advance for your wisdom!

<p>Do you plan on making actual business of it? Then I'd say – <strong>probably not</strong>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_mille" rel="nofollow">CPM</a> of Google AdSense, and the likes, are usually about 10-25 cents CPM. For bloggers and other low-cost online sites that should cover the basic costs, and even make some money if you're big. To make actual money on a site, you need more than that.</p>

<p>Andrew Chen have written well about how "<a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2008/04/04/your-ad-supported-web-20-site-is-actually-a-b2b-enterprise-in-disguise/" rel="nofollow">Your ad-supported Web 2.0 site is actually a B2B enterprise in disguise</a>", which is worth the excellent read. His point being, to make actual money you're going to have to sell your ad space yourself, by providing a good audience segmentation (what's your visitor demographics) to a suitable advertiser.</p>

<p>But as with everything, there is another side to this story.</p>

<p><strong>It's a start</strong>. And perhaps an important start. Maybe it covers your server costs, etc, allowing your a few extra hours a week to produce new features, or grow your audience? AdSense may very well be on the path to your sustainable business model.</p>

<p>However, it's important that your bet isn't <em>"I have to grow huge before I can grow profitable"</em>. Very few businesses succeed at that, and the costs are immense. Your investors know from the bubble days that it's not a bet worth taking. (Even Facebook, at > 500M users isn't really profitable)</p>

<p>In short, day one you need to <strong>have an idea what your business model will be</strong>. And day two, you start exploring if the idea you have can generate any sales ("maybe these guys would pay for promoted posts", "maybe if I charge for this extra feature", etc.) If it works, try scaling it, if it doesn't throw it away, come up with something new and try that. Iterate quickly.</p>

<p>Wow, I feel like I can go on forever. But my basic advice is: have an idea and start exploring it early.</p>

You should study the marvellous world of business models (the best reference so far: http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/) and, if you feel overwhelmed and/or lazy, contact an expert.

The easy way is to try different business models in a short period of time and research which is better for your web page.

Theoretically, you can and a lot of people do it, but without knowing the specifics of you website idea i doubt nobody can give you more detailed answer.
