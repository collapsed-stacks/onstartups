I've pre-launched my start-up two days ago. After being featured on a few sites, we now have a good influx of subscribers. Now I know an inevitable slow down subscribers will happen if I don't act quickly. 

What are some things I can do to gain more exposure?

I've already started submitting our start-up to other sites and am now thinking of other measures.

If you are getting a lot of subscribers and they are loving your product the best thing you can do is think of a creative way for them to encourage their friends, co-workers or other businesses to use it.  

Mass email - ask them to tell a friend, run a contest, send out some promotion codes, incentives for recommending people. Month free for each friend who becomes a paid subscribers.  

Something like that. You want your growth curve to be exponential so you need each subscriber to tell a couple friends.  

Also getting exposure on blogs, review sites, having people naturally praising your product over Twitter and social networks doesn't hurt.

Hard to say without knowing your audience and the target market.

With the way people interact through social media, that is the best way to expand on your base users.  If they are technie and it fits into your site, runnnig a contest where you require them to tweet/retweet a certain phrase/hashtag related to your site is a decent short term boost you could try.
