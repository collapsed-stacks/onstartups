I am writing a Business Plan and I am currently using website resources for help; but I believe that a good book can help me more.

So what (good) books do you advice me for helping me writing my Business Plan? (I am founding a social internet website)

Thank you,

Fabien.

I wouldn't read a book on the topic (nor would I create a book when writing your plan). I don't think you can beat the business plan advice given by Sequoia Capital:

I think you should talk to as many people as you can , especially people who have started their own company . Look for key things that are must have in your plan ( like your earnings forecast , your target segment, Cost management, Key team and your plans for overall market strategy). Again , i have not read any particular book and i dont's say book would not be useful at all, but still i think you need more of practical insight of the market you want to enter , sales challenges , existing offerings. You will be able to get only by people who have done similar work. So , talk to as many people and get priority list for your BP.

<p>I wrote a book titled, "How to Write a Business Plan Executive Summary."  Have you ever heard of the famous Venture Capitalist and Author, Guy Kawasaki?  In his book, The Art of the Start, he said,</p>

<p>"Of the effort you put into write a business plan, 80 percent should go into the executive summary.  These are the most important paragraphs of your organization’s existence.” </p>

<p>That is why I believe that this Executive Summary book will provide great value to you in your effort to write your business plan.  You can find it at <a href="http://www.howtowriteanexecutivesummary.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtowriteanexecutivesummary.com</a>.  Or you can access my free business planning resources at my ExecutivePlan Blog.</p>
