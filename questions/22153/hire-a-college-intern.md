How should one go about trying to offer internship to students at XYZ university?  

And is it even possible for a startup company?

Some sample conditions that would be under consideration:

==sample==  
1. Unpaid position  
2. Social media marketing related work  
3. Work through the year    
4. Could lead to full time job  
==sample==

We need a bit more information to answer this question. 

 1. Is the position paid or unpaid?
 2. Does the position require special skills? (looking for a computer programmer, for example)
 3. Is it possible to work throughout the year, or just the summer?
 4. Could this lead to a full time job?

Even with that information, a lot depends on the specific University or College you are recruiting from. At a small college you may be able to locate a specific professor who teaches something your potential intern needs to know. He or she may be able to directly recommend someone, or post an ad for you in class, or in a specific student area.

A large University may have a formal policy. You might have to work with their HR department to list an opening. 

But **you** need to formalize exactly what you are looking for and what you offer before contacting the school.

If it is a real job (i.e. $) then call a local college, most of them will post job ads on a wire service. IIRC we paid $300 and it went to several big colleges in the state. 

Can you re-write the description so it doesn't look like a typical craigslist work-for-me-for-free-you-might-get-a-job posting? An internship is supposed to give the intern real world experience and skills, they are not a source of free labor.

Yes you can certainly do that. Contact the univ and ask them the procedures and requirements for posting an internship. 

Also be sure to ask where you can view other internships being offered so you have an idea what your competition is offering. 

Don't be surprised to find that tech heavy fields demand paid (sometimes fairly high) internships.
