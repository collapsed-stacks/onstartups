Woot.com sells one product each day. Does anyone know where they source their products? If it's overstock stuff or items that manufacturers want to get rid of, how would I get in touch with these manufacturers? Does Woot actually store and ship the products themselves or do they outsource that?

<p>These sites like <a href="http://www.woot.com/" rel="nofollow">woot</a> our <a href="http://www.groupon.com/" rel="nofollow">groupon</a> work by promising a certain number of sales based on previous site traffic.</p>

<p>They are essentially advertisers, so they would go to a particular company and say "we expect we can move X amount off product if you can give us Y% off". This site suggests groupon <a href="http://www.socialtimes.com/2010/08/groupon-gap-social-buying/" rel="nofollow">made quite a nice deal</a> on their GAP offer.</p>

<p>It's not necessarily overstock or items manufacturers want to get rid of, these sites need good quality product to be popular.</p>

<p>I would assume they don't deal with the logistical side of things as the business they sell for already does this, they are just a social front-end.</p>

<p>The targets for these sites are big distributors/manufacturers who have plenty of product to move.</p>

<p>If you want to build a site like this you are best to start small, work with those places that already spend a lot of money on advertising e.g. deals on pizza etc. and then work your way up as the traffic increases.</p>
