I have a customer who would like to make a large order and have it shipped from the US to Japan.  It will likely ship in 2-3 packages and weigh between 75 & 100lbs total.  They will be paying me retail roughly $4,500 USD. 

I need to figure out the best way to ship this and also how do I accurately estimate the tariffs and Taxes that I will need to pay in order to ship this.  They are paying 100% upfront so I need to accurately be able to charge them. 

Thanks for any help!

For heavy packages sent internationally I would recommend using ipsparcel.com
A quote for a box to Japan for 100 pounds, 20x20x20 shows up to be under $300 for 3-5 day airmail. 

I ship a lot internationally, usually a lot lighter though, and usps gives the best rates for boxes that aren't >70 pounds

I usually leave customs charges up to the buyer, but I believe ipsparcel lets you choose to pay for customs fees upfront if you want to.
