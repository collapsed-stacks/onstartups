I had an interview at a startup and things went well. The HR called me later and asked me what my expectation of salary was. I then told them what I was expecting. A week later, they came back asking for my W-2. I don't really feel comfortable giving out my W-2. How do I handle the situation. The position is for a senior management one. 

Thanks

Tell them absolutely not (politely). They have no right or legal authority to ask for that information.


I don't get why companies should be concerned about what you made before.

Also, for the record, what you make is *your* information, not the company's. Therefore, unless you sign an agreement saying that you'll not tell anyone your salary, you can choose who to tell it to.. including coworkers.

Show them another form of salary validation, such as an employment offer letter with the salary amount from your previous employer. Certain apartment complexes accept these in lieu of a W-2.

It is pretty common that your offer letter or contract would mention that the compensation is **confidential** information. Sharing it with anyone who is not your own proxy (like your accountant) will be a breach of contract.

Tell them politely that as they expect you to honor your contract with them, they should respect you honoring your contract with the previous employer and keeping your compensation confidential as you promised.

Unless they don't want you to keep your promises to them, but then you probably don't want to work there.
