I have just been sent a link, from a somewhat trusted source, to a system for catagorising Entrepreneurs and before handing over the money wanted to see if anyone else has heard about it.

**From Wikipedia**: [The system is a psychometric test based on the work of Carl Jung][1]. 

It asks you a series of questions in order to place you into 1 or 2 of 8 catagories. The idea being that from there you can find others that complement your skillset, effectively taking a more structured/scientific approach to finding business partners than the provailing random chance and mates thing.

So from the sound of it, if it works it could help in understanding teams better and understanding how things could be structured better ... The question is, is this actually the case or is it another overhyped fad that is being cashed in on before it gets forgotten again?

From your wikipedia link it appears to have been invented in 2003 and then ignored for the next 8 years. 

*"The system is a psychometric test based on the work of Carl Jung, and linking his work to the I Ching"*

You might be better off googling "Wealth Dynamics scam" and follow what pops up.

I have done this test and actually found it quite useful. It is not dissimilar from other tests such as Myers Briggs, wrapped in a different style and a bit simpler.

Is it useful in helping you spend some time thinking about your strengths and weaknesses and how teams fit together? Yes.

Will it reveal a secret insight that will make you fabulously rich? Unlikely.

Probably worth noting I have done the test, and not got involved with any other emails, seminars or associated stuff which I can't comment on the value of.
