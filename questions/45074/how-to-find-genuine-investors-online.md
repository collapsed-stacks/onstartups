How to find sound (Small Business) investors that can recognize an outstanding opportunity when they see one? I mean how to find them *online*? Cuz it’s such a waste of time when one (startup founder) keeps meeting the same non-winners that once invested in a barber shop and 3 haircuts later they believe they are famous venture capitalists …

There isn't an ideal place where you will find the perfect investor, just like there aren't websites where they just give you your perfect soul mate. You have to visit the site and find people who you like! You should use Angelist, my friends have found success there. Many companies have received more than million dollars in funding through there. You have to make a page for your company/product and keep it updated like a profile. People stumble upon your profile or you can spread your Angelist profile. You can find investors there and appeal to them directly if you wish. Angelist is probably only one of many other places to find investors. You can find investors locally too if you do some research but I suggest finding someone on Angelist or similar websites because they hold the investors accountable and it affects their online presence.
