You could also look at choosing a monetary value and allow potential directors to select what they want. Tailoring the package would make it more valuable to them.

It all depends on the company HR policies. To get a better idea, try to identify a company somewhat similar to yours and see what they do. You need a benefits package competitive enough to prevent your competition from poaching your talent.
