I'm battling with this issue for a while.

I host my domain at DiscountAsp and although I'm very happy with the hosting, their email web application has some limitations.

Basically what I need is a web based email application to access my email accounts in <b>one place</b> without having to login on each one separately. 

Example:  
I have these emails: info@company.com, sales@company.com, stefanos.tses@company.com and support@company.com.

 + I want to login in one account and see all emails that come from all the above email address and anything else that comes to @company.com domain (catch-all) in the same place.  
 + I want the ability to reply to emails and the system automatically to recognize the account (from address) and send the email from that account with its own signature.
So, if I get an email to support@company.com and reply to sender, the email is send from support@company.com not the account I used to login.

I did some research on gmail but I could find any clarifications on the above issues.
I know many of you using Gmail for business. 

Does Gmail covers the above scenarios?

Thanks.

Yes. You can load in mail from other accounts via one main account.

You can use Gmail with these redirects (I have done it personally with my email addresses too). Still, I am gettin more "wary" at the privacy issues. The "buzz" scandal reminded me that ALL I have in my emails goes and remains on their servers, even when I delete the account. I am still using it, but have one email address that's on my server only. It's tedious having to log in there, but I'd like to remove myself from Gmail in the near future. I don't have stuff to hide, but still, it's better to manage my emails on my own.

Don't forget to set up your outgoing server as your own domain's smtp server and not use gmails server.  If you do, some email clients report "xxx@gmail.com on behalf of yyy@company.com"  - not good in my opinion.  It took me months to find that...
