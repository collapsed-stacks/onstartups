Currently the software is in alpha and we're looking for some more users and are not sure where the best place is to drop an invite code or whatever other strategy will help us gather up some business owners and give away some free websites.  

But in addition to that, we're creating a marketing strategy for when we launch the paid version, and are trying to think of the best way to market this product and get it to spread.  

The only thing we know we are going to do is SEO, because I have another company that is an expert in that field.  

Any ideas??

One idea is to try looking for groups on linkedin with members that approximate your target audience. Let people know what you are doing and they might be interested if you offer them something in return.
