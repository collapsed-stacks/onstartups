Basically I am starting an online marketplace and community  for a specific industry and I have no idea how to begin attracting the buyers and sellers that will make up the community. Mass email? Social media? SEO? Any help is appreciated

Don't start until you understand the psyche of your potential users. Study the issues that site like eBay are faced with. From what I know the issue #1 is fraud. It is a high liability and expensive problem to deal with. Have you heard of BidPay? They were #2 after eBay. That's what brought that company down. Marketplace companies are the hardest ones to start. Usually they are an end-product of some other activity, like popular forum or billeting board.

Don't invest any money, only time at this point and learn from mistakes of others.

Best of luck.

<p>Scott, if you are building this for a specific industry I suggest you try and build an online community for this industry either first or in parallel.</p>

<p>I suggest once you register your domain start with a blog at somewhere like www.example.com/blog and start writing industry specific articles.</p>

<p>Make sure your articles a well written and then include social networking links like Facebook like, tweet this article etc.</p>

<p>You can then install some "free" forum software to expand your community further.</p>

<p>The interactions on these sections of your site and any quality advice in your articles will only be a plus to feeding traffic to your main site.</p>

<p>Both this site <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com">answers.onstartups.com</a> and the entire <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">stack exchange</a> network were built on the back of large thriving communities. A great first step for creating buzz.</p>

Agree with slatecaster, don't start (at least, not yet). 

The problem of attracting sellers and buyers won't go away when you finished your product. First you need to find potential customers. If you don't know anybody in the industry (which is strange... do you want to start a product for an industry you don't know at all?), you can try to attend industry conferences and events. Bring with you just a simple presentation of your idea, show it to as many people you can and listen their reaction. Are the interested?

If they are, take their business cards and ask them permission to contact them again when the product is ready.

Be able to read google product feeds.  Many sites feed their products to googlebase.  Use the same format to make it simple.  Then you will have some products to begin with..
