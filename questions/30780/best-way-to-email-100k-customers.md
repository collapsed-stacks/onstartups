## Best way to email 100k customers

We offer a free and paid version of our product. We have about 100k users who have used one or the other. We'd like to start sending a monthly email newsletter to them (that they can opt out of). We're trying to figure out the best way to send the email.

So I see that iContact offers plans of up to 100k people, but its $600 / month which is more than we'd like to pay. So we're thinking of sending them from our dedicated server. Although we're not spamming, I'm afraid of getting blacklisted just due to the quantity we send. So I guess my questions are:

1. Are our fears of getting blacklisted legitimate? I'm not really sure how that works.
2. Do you guys have any other suggestions (including cheaper paid services)?

Thanks!
Jim

First off, don't attempt to do this yourself. Sending mass amounts of email quickly, reliably and dealing with all the spam protection mechanisms today is an immense amount of work. Sending 100,000 emails is not trivial, you will get flagged for spam if you don't do it correctly.

I recommend MailChimp (http://mailchimp.com/), they have lots of tiered pricing so you might be able to get something cheaper.
