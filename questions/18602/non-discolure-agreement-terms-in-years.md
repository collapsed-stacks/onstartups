Hope you all are well,

I started a game production company to outsource development of iphone games, we are signing NDAs with many companies and submitting our concept, however there was recent question within my company on the terms of years in a NDA. 

I was advised by my friend to keep the NDAs unlimied in terms of years, meaning it never expires unless terminated. At this moment it is two years with every company we sign.

I dont understand, are there even NDAs that have no termination in terms of years?

**I don't think there is a hard-and-fast rule on this.** I have commonly seen 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 year and perpetual NDAs.

Some jurisdictions don't permit certain types of perpetual civil agreements, so in some countries a perpetual NDA might actually be *weaker* than one with a finite lifespan.

IMHO it depends. I don't like NDA's much, so on the rare occasions that I use them, I keep their terms simple and limit the NDA with a short lifespan (typically 1 year). IMHO, a NDA with a short duration presents less risk to my negotiation counterpart, and keeps negotiations more friendly and hassle-free. After a year, the kind lesser valuable business secrets I deal with are worthless anyways.

You're outsourcing the actual creation of your software, i.e. your core asset. In that case, a longer NDA term might be reasonable (fx 5 years, 10 years), especially if you will continue to iterate on the same idea with new versions (like Civilization I, II, III, IV, etc).

In all cases, I think you should see a qualified lawyer who is specialized in your type of business or Intellectual Property. Don't take advice from a random friend or from me as solid -- ask a lawyer. :-)
