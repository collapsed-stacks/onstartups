I have an Android app with Admob banner ads. Currently the banners show ads for things that aren't very relevant to my audience. I've seen other mobile apps serving the same niche where the Google provided ads are very relevant to the particular niche. **How can I ensure the Admob ads served to my app are relevent?**

I've looked through the settings provided by the Admob site. There are plenty of filters for what I don't want (for example gambling). However I don't see anything that allows me to specify exactly what I **do** want. I know Google has inventory for my niche since other mobile apps and websites serving the particular niche have perfectly targeted ads.

<p>AdMob is based on impressions, not relevance -- there is no way to target ads to a particular niche; this based on reviewing Admob's <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1620102&amp;topic=1620071&amp;ctx=topic" rel="nofollow">help section</a> and <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2140764/Google-AdMob-A-Performance-Marketers-Opinion" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. </p>
