Every web site owner wants more traffic. There's an overwhelming amount of information out there about Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Some is legitimate, some outdated, much is based on rumor and innuendo. In addition, there are no shortage of people willing to take your money with promises of magical SEO that will bring web traffic beyond your wildest dreams.

So, where can I get accurate, reliable, up-to-date information about legitimately enhancing my business website's reputation with the search engines? 

I'll start the list with a few obvious choices: 

1. The thoroughly foundational [Google's SEO Starter Guide][2].

2. The ever practical [Google Webmaster Central Blog][1]. 

3. Matt Cutts' (Google Employee Extraordinaire) no nonsense blog [Gadget's, Google & SEO][3].

I second Inbound Marketing - also The Web Startup Success Guide by Bob Walsh.

These are my two favourite books at the moment :-)  Both are Fantastic.

<p>Depending on the business, it's really not that hard to get most <em>local</em> businesses on to the front page for searches like CityName+TypeOfBusiness using ethical means but it can certainly be harder when you're competing against the world.  There's a million tips out there, and here's the ones I find to be best bang for your buck:</p>

<p>-Use Analytics software like Google Analytics to get an idea of your stats</p>

<p>-Use SEO/Rank tracking tools like <a href="http://RavenTools.com" rel="nofollow">http://RavenTools.com</a> to measure where you and your competitors rank for your key terms</p>

<p>-Use tools like <a href="http://OpenSiteExplorer.org" rel="nofollow">OpenSiteExplorer.org</a> to see what links your competitors have that you don't, and try to get links from them if feasible</p>

<p>-If you have limited web resources, move your site to a platform like Wordpress or Drupal which can easily give you many SEO bells and whistles</p>

<p>-Make sure each of your pages has distinct, descriptive page titles and descriptions</p>

<p>-Make sure you 301 redirect all your pages to either www.site.com or site.com to ensure search engines (namely, bing &amp; yahoo) aren't spreading your rankings to both versions of your page.</p>

<p>-Use Google Sitemaps to make search engines more easily know when your pages are updated</p>

Explore the top 5 factors listed below that influence your website’s ranking on Google’s search results:

1. Accessibility of the Website- The accessibility of the search engines to your website should be made possible by your robots.txt file.If this file has errors in it, then a lot of search engines will not access your site, or even list it.Also, the underlying HTML codes of your web pages must be free of errors, the correct responsecode should be returned by your web server. Your web page contents should be such that the search engine spiders can read them.This can be achieved with a spider simulator.

2. Site Architecture-Google is only interested in displaying relevant sites in the search result page.Ensuring that there is relationship between the pages of your website is a good way to be ranked among the top 10 positions in Google search results.The arrangement of your web pages should indicate to Google that your site is related to a central topic.

3. Keywords-Among the top secrets of earning a higher ranking on Google, is the right choice of keywords.A wrong selection of keywords means total failure of your campaign.

4. Uniqueness of Website Content-Distinguish your site from the crowd by creating high quality and unique content; also ensure that the articles are centred on your general topic.Your website should contain useful resources.

5. Other Websites that Link to Your Website-One of the top factors for ranking high in Google is the links from other websites. But ensure that such links are from relevant and quality websites.

There's plenty of cowboys out there who'll garantee you a top 10 position. That's not possible, do never participate in any of that. For all you know these guys will use SEO Black hat to get you in the top 10, for about two weeks and then get a Big ass penalty from Matt Cutts!

You can get eeliable info about SEO from:

googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/
seomoz.org/
seobook.com/blog
mattcutts.com/blog/type/googleseo/
youtube.com/user/wilreynolds

In some book the SEO basics are explained well. The advanced stuff isn't usually written in books, but more often on blogs. Oh and eh, I advise you to invest in an SEO buddy ;)
