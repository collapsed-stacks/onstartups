Is it advisable to opt for a word 24x7 within the domain name that will make it 12 characters?

Does it effect the marketablity of the domain name?

If you speak the domain name, can someone type it in? If not, you might have a problem. If I say go to "Tommy24x7.com" what will people do?

tommy24x7.com

tommy24/7.com

tommy247.com

tommy24-7.com

tommy24by7.com

Only one of those is correct. This willbe a problem if you ever expect people to respond to spoken advertising or word of mouth.

It's great for a convenience store neon sign.....
but.... 

 1. the entire internet is 24/7... 
 1. 12 characters is too much
 1. 24/7 is becoming the "Color TV!!" sign from the 70's and 80's....you don't want oldies like that for an internet domain

It's great to have 24x7 in National or other key words...for example..

 1. India24x7 is better business name than india just becuase 24x7 says non-stop action while other doesn't.

 2. Markets24x7.com is better business name than Markets.com becuase 24x7 when added to brand name or domain name, it adds lots of action & dynamism in it.

 3. National names are free of trade-mark related issues & therefore in absence of availibility of national names now, its better to have national names with 24x7, as the national names are respected by millions of the citizens & remembered forever...

In short 24x7 names are good when added to national or key-word viz. markets, funds, lottery, auction etc..
