I'm looking for things I can sell/do to make $25k within 3 months. Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

I'm not sure what kind of startup is going to cost 25K right from the beginning (franchise?), but it doesn't sound like a bootstrap approach.

Check your costs. See what you can do without or put off until later. A contractor should not ask for 3 months of fees up front (Ok, they can ask, but negotiate.).

Lease hardware or go a cheaper route until you get some users.

Can you generate some potential sales before buying product? Maybe get some supplier credit.

Your investors must love you very much to give you $25K without a business plan but also very optimist to give you the money and expect to get it back in 3 months.  

Come up with a plan on what you can do and try to build a product or service around it. Then raise the money to help achieve your goals.
