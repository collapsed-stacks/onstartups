Greetings,


I am planning on joining a start up with someone as a co-founder and right now we're in a hurry to get product off the ground.  I've worked with this person in 
a trial period and I believe that we has the skills to make this company work.  He has established the S-Corp company and been in business for a while.

I would like to defer the bulk of the legal costs for the start up by having an "Memorandum of understanding" on the important terms of the co-ownership.

Thus, resources can be spent on making product rather than atticipating and preparing for success that happens about 1/3 of the time.  And legal is expensive, but probably
less expensive than a lawsuit.  Ergo, I will be running the "MOU" we reach though a lawyer regardless.

Unfortunately, this will be my first start up, so I am unaware of the "important terms" and what to ask for beyond the basics.

I have covered with him:

1. Percentage of the company
2. Vesting period

 2a. As a side question.... How do I prevent myself from being shoved out the door 1 day before the 1 year cliff?

3. Acceleration of vesting in advent of liquidation event
4. Money invested

I have the following questions:

1. Is this a good idea?
2. What other terms should I put into the agreement? ( while respecting #1 :)
3. What about a binding abritration clause?

For many questions on this site, non-lawyers will respond by saying that you need to hire a lawyer and that you are wasting your time seeking legal information here.  Most of the time, I think that is overblown and that it is perfectly reasonable to seek legal information on this site with the understanding that you get what you pay for.  Often, the risks are relatively low.

Here, however, the only reasonable answer is to hire a lawyer.  You are going to be spending lots of time and perhaps money on this venture.  Anything you draft yourself will be filled with ambiguities and will invite dispute and litigation down the road if your venture is ever successful.  This is the case even (especially) if you are friendly with your cofounder. 

I suspect you can get this done by a lawyer for less than $1000.

In this case, you say your co-founder has already established the S-Corp.  So it sounds like, legally, he owns everything and you own nothing.  Even more reason to be careful.

PS.  I am a lawyer (but not your lawyer).

EDIT:  I missed that you will by running your MOU by a lawyer.  These are great questions to ask him.  Any corporate lawyer will have done many of these and can easily adapt a template to your needs.

While your intended approach is rational, here's the downside that I see:

 - You (correctly) want the MOU to address all details and address them thoroughly. A short, superficial MOU is of little value and may cause more harm than good.
 - However, even if you are given a list of all of the issues you should address, you are unlikely to put together a very good MOU from the lawyer's perspective. In my experience, reviewing and fixing a client-prepared document never takes less time - and usually takes more time - than my preparing the document myself in the first place would have.
 - As a result, you will have spent a good chunk of the money you would spend with a lawyer to create the appropriate corporate documents rather than an MOU, but you will lack the security of having those corporate documents already in place. Assuming that the existing corporation was formed fully and properly, a lawyer who is experienced working with startups should be able to adapt the corporate documents that you need from those created from other clients with only a modest expenditure of time and, thus, fees.
