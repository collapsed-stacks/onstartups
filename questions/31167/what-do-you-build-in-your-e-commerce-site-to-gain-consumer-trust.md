I'm co-founding a start-up that is developing an e-commerce app. We're trying to decide what features to build in that shoppers would expect to see in order to feel comfortable submitting credit card orders: SSL, clear return/privacy policies, a "seal of approval" badge (e-trust, BBB), 800 number/chat for customer questions, etc...

So my question is simply what is on your list of security and consumer trust "must-have" features when installing any kind of shopping cart on your site?

I would have to say that the number one factor for me would be a professional looking site that is easy to use, and number two is contact information that is easy to find in case the customer has any questions.

**SSL**

You can buy an extended certificate for your website. This will display the green bar in browsers and also lists your business information in the URL bar. 

**Videos/Photos**

If it's appropriate for the app, try to include photos of the team/business, or even better: videos.

**Active Twitter Account**

Create some sort of support twitter account that is actually being used. Then display the latest tweets in some sort of widget to show people that there are actual people behind the site.

**Short forms**

Keep the buy forms as short as possible and don't ask for any information that isn't absolutely necessary.

My list would be:

 - Non spamming web domain (ie. not www.super-cheap-stuff-warehouse.com)
 - SSL
 - Security logos (SSL certificate, etc.)
 - Professional design (a bad looking website will never get my payment details)
 - Testimonials
 - Obvious contact details
 - Clear terms that are available during purchase
 - Quality product pictures (if appropriate)

I can tell you what I think, but I am not your target customer...  What I would suggest is to use split testing to figure this out.

I know of a start-up that used this very method in order to figure out how big the VeriSign logo needed to be (in his case it was the medium sized one, on the left side, but it might be different for you).

In any case, I believe in the 37 signals philosophy that says you should have as few features as you can get by with, not as many as you can create.

Good luck with your start-up!  Please let us (and future readers of onstartups) know what worked best for you.

If your brand is new and it's clear that you haven't been in business long, than having a PayPal option isn't a bad idea in addition to CC payments. Are you thinking of "secure feeling" as one way to improve conversions? If yes, then consider offering a free trial with payment info collection - your customers will feel better knowing they can try the product risk free and cancel before they get billed, unless of course customer need is short-term and is taken care of within a trial period.

I didn't see anyone mention TrustE logo, people like that from what I hear, but it's a bit expensive - last I spoke to TrustE their lowest option was $1500/year (no trial) and that included a policy on their site and quite a low volume of views so this would work better for high priced products.

Publish real testimonials, both positive and negative reviews, create an easy-to-use site structure and sophisticated design, add products' photos and detailed descriptions, post all the contact information, including mobile phone, e-mail, social networks etc.
Remember about return policy and delivery conditions â€“ they should be clear and thorough. Consider creating a mobile app or mobile-friendly website version for the clients who prefer browsing via smartphones or tablets.
