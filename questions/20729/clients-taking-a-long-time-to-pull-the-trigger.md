We are a startup building an e-learning tool for the medical education market, and we had a few meetings with colleges. 

One potential client is taking a long time to decide whether to use our product or not, as they know they have a need right now, but are still a little skeptical.
  
Other clients want to try our product before buying it. 

Can you suggest how to proceed now? And also, how to speed up the whole process of conversion?

We are not looking for more clients this year (2011), however, we are still not successful with just one client, and we've been at it for more than 6 months.

Schools can take a **very** long time to make a purchase decision. Especially if it is for a major amount of money. You need someone to manage the sales process for that client- keep track of where they are in the purchase decision, answering questions, and proding them along the path to buy your software. (Assuming your software sells for enough money to make this worthwhile.)

You should **immediately** start work on some sort of trial for your product. Many school want to actually test the software as part of their purchase process. If you don't offer a trial you either delay, or lose, the sales decision.

I just closed something with a school that took over 9 months. I definitely agree with the prior posters.

If you're dealing with the medical realm, have you considered opening up your product to those who are studying, rather than those who are established in the profession?  Allowing low-cost trials to people studying can help build future adoption.  In a similar situation developing a platform for health professionals, we got a lot of great feedback and support from those new to the field or about to join it: they were inherently more receptive to new tools and new methods because they're looking to distinguish themselves.

Nobody ever wants to buy something without first knowing if it works, or meets their needs. Schools have scarce funding and investing in a new software solution is a big risk for a school, let alone anyone.

Let them try it out, a school is hardly going to rip you off.

If someone is having trouble making a decision, it is because they don't have enough information to make the decision. They are broadcasting this to you. They have even told you how to solve that problem for them. Give them a trial product already!

Been there, done that. Expect a two to three year cycle, and longer if the committee members leave and new people join. 

If you offer a free trial it will have to be for one semester. 60 days might work for a business but not for a school. If you try to tell them to stop using your software halfway through a class you have just told them you are ignorant of your market.

And validate your pricing model. Is it one upfront fee, annual fee or per student fee? Schools have very rigid budgets and typically a per student fee fits their budget structure better.

You need to get one happy customer first. Then they will help with word-of-mouth to help you get other customers. Everyone will ask 'which other schools are using this?'

<p>I think they are right. Model your business the way some things are done on the internet. Don't abandon the principles that work on the internet because you're not in cyberspace anymore.</p>

<p>You know that almost everything on the internet nowadays gives you a FREE Trial for say, 30 days. I signed up for a product just the other day because they're giving me 60 days to try it out. Look, <strong>60 DAYS??</strong> OF COURSE I'll try it out. No credit card info or anything upfront.</p>

<p>The FREE 60-DAY trial was the only reason for trying it out and I know that sounds bad but its too bad. It's the truth. I had no intentions of buying it. However, I am so pleased with it that I am really going to purchase it at the end.</p>

<p>The FREE Trial! That's going to be your money-maker. </p>

<p>Give them something for FREE in exchange to have them at least install your software and see if it works. Even if your free product is a trial and comes to an end. Give them a realistic free trial period like 60 or 90 days to see some positive results. If it improves their processes.</p>

<p>I wish I was your salesman. I'd close that deal YESTERDAY! and any other college you went to. Well, that's my two cents. I'm aggressive and to the point</p>

<p>Point is: Re-visit the school. Let them know if they want a 60-day trial, access granted. I GUARANTEE they'll go for it. They have nothing to lose. Make your situation a win win and you will actually win. The more colleges that actually TRY the product the better because not everyone will buy it but your goal is to have them, at the very least, try it out.</p>

<p>Change your mindset. It's not whether the client <strong>buys</strong> it at this point. Its whether they go through your trial period and actually like it first.</p>

<p>Best of Luck</p>
