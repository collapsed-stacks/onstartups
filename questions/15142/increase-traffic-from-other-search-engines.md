I took a look at my Google analytics report under Top Traffic Sources:

    (direct)  ((none))          29.16%
    google (organic)            25.59%
    yahoo (organic)             5.48%
    facebook.com (referral)     3.72% 

 There's a huge discrepancy between Google and Yahoo! even though I believe Y! has by far more of my pages indexed. Does the number reflect the lower usage of Y! by users or does Google likes my optimization more?

Dig deeper into your analytics.  What keywords are coming from Yahoo?  Where do you rank for those keywords?  What pages are visitors hitting coming from those keywords?  Optimize those pages for the relevant keywords.

Do the same for all your search engine traffic.
