I have recently launched a new gallery selling my London artwork. I don't mind saying that the problem now is that I am unsure how to push the site forward and begin making sales. 

I know about the more traditional marketing strategies on the internet (i.e PPC and SEO). My issue seems to be targeting and finding the correct market. Do I for example focus offline and contact local businesses? Do I aim for the tourist market? Do I aim for collectors? What would be a good strategy to pursue?

<p>Considering that you're selling art, you might want to go get involved with people and communities that are interested in art, and in buying art.</p>

<p>Offline, you could print out flyers and stuff.</p>

<p>Online, get social - there are a lot of awesome artists - painters and photographers, on Google+, sharing their work, and discussing their art. There are whole circles and communities for such stuff. Getting involved there would get you noticed. Maybe have a contest or gimmick. (At least)One artist on G+ would sketch the profile pic of another member. You could organize a photowalk in London - and promote your site through that. Maybe offer the best or a selection of best photos getting featured on your site. Or you could share photography tips and lessons online. There is also a <a href="http://photo.stackexchange.com/">photography SE</a> - you could get involved there, maybe get a photo or two <a href="http://meta.photo.stackexchange.com/questions/2657/weekly-featured-image-ongoing-contest">featured</a>.</p>

I am no expert on fine photography, but at a price of approx. 235 US Dollars your prints aren't exactly a bargain. This price point must be seen as a **good perceived value** for your customers. What I can see right now is an elegant website and excellent photography. What I miss is information about the photographer (the "story" behind Oliver Rice and his work) as well as more details about the print / frame quality.

Think of it like Starbucks vs McDonalds. Starbucks coffee costs three times more - but people don't just go there for that black liquid. The "product" is really the entire store, the company, the people (and the coffee).

In terms of segmentation (local biz vs. tourists vs. collectors), there is a simple answer to that: **ask them**. Yes, as simple as that: 

 - go out and talk to **5 tourists** (that you think might be interested in fine photography; skip the backpackers...), 
 - ask **5 friends** that work in offices and find out what hangs on their walls. Ask them who purchases them and what at what price point etc.
 - find out how you can talk to **5 collectors** (I have no idea; maybe online forums) and what they consider worthy of acquiring.

The best way to find out who is the right target audience is to try to understand *their* value perception. In all likelihood, this will be different from your assumptions.

<p>Sorry to say, <strong>launching a website is only part of the equation</strong>. </p>

<p>In fact, many would likely say that you got it backwards - customer segment first, site second.  What <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/what-is-customer-development.html" rel="nofollow">customer development</a> have you done? Do you have a <a href="http://leancanvas.com/why-leancanvas-vs-business-model-canvas" rel="nofollow">business model</a>?  </p>

<p>Hans made a great point on customer segmentation - there are multiple audiences to consider, each with their pricing / service / competitive offering expectations.</p>

<p>PPC / SEC etc. will further confuse things if you don't have a clear understanding of which campaign appeals to the segment you are targeting.  </p>
