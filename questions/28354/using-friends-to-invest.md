I have developed a website idea but have no funds to get it started.  I have told friends close to me about my idea and they love it..some have even offered to invest in the company.  Im thinking I would need about 40k to build a website and do some market data research just to get started.  I have already aproached major companies that are essential to the sucess of my site and they had interest but would like to see more proof that the site would work.  I figured I would just build the site and provide results from the market research done.  What should I offer as far as price of shares and what % of shares of the company should I offer?

<p>Sounds like you're on the right track.  Some other things to think of as well:  Are you planning to outsource the construction of the website or hire someone?  How to promote the prototype to build users that validate the idea?</p>

<p>Fred Wilson, notable investor, wrote a blog earlier this year on <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/05/financing-options-friends-and-family.html" rel="nofollow">Financing Options: Friends and Family</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd suggest a cap that gives the friends and family around 10% of the
  business if things work out. But that is just a suggestion. A 10%
  interest will not be appropriate for every friends and family
  investment.</p>
