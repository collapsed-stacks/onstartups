I have an online business doing web design. I currently live in Indiana and have my LLC registered there. My husband and I want to move to Colorado, but don't plan on making it a permanent move. We plan to be out there for 2-3 years.

Can I keep my LLC registered in Indiana and just pay Indiana taxes? I do not meet with clients in person (everything is online), and my clients come from all across the US. I have no employees and am the only "partner".

What kind of forms would I need to file in Colorado? How does this affect taxes?

Thank you!
