I have a single member LLC.

When paying a contractor (about 10k) is it okay to just do a ACH bank transfer or should I send them a check.

Related, when I pay myself, it is okay to do an ACH bank transfer to my personal account or do you recommend sticking with checks.

Thanks!

It's really all the same in the end.  From an accounting perspective you will handle it the same in either scenario.

It makes no difference from a tax/accounting perspective:  there is a good audit trail either way.  

It may be more difficult to reconcile your bank account and month-end if your bank doesn't provide good details for your ACH's, but that's an operational issue.
