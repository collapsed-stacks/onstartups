Hi I got the first client from one of the freelancing website.But they are asked to send the address proof to them.In our first conversation they asked this and my bank details.Apart from this they interviewed me in technical aspects.Nothing more than in this we discussed.Is it common to send address and bank details from the first discussion itself?May I send the details to them?

It is not only common sense, in many jurisdictions it is illegal not to.

In germany, for example, ALL WRITTEN COMMUNICATION (emails included) must include:

* The company name and at least registered address
* The registration information (number, location of registration)

Depending on legal form you may have to list managers etc., too.

On invoices:

* Tax number

My letterheads have all this plus some more (email, url). It is part of a professional lookout.

Actually you msut  give most of this information on a website you operate, too ;)
