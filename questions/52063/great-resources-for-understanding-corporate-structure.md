<p>I'm looking for suggestions on some particularly detailed resources explaining corporate structure, workings, etc. Everything there is to know about handling investment and boards. </p>

<p><strong>I want very detailed web articles, books, movies, etc.</strong> </p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not looking for what makes a great CEO, or philosophical marketing of great business ownership or project lead. I'm looking for the bare-bone all-out explanations of how a large corporation works from the time of filing for corporation status to time of choosing CEO, handling investors, also, very specifically, shares and handling exactly how much power investors  are given in controlling a company's board.</p>
