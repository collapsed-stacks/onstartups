I'm making a content-driven webapp and I was wondering it there are any "Content filling" services that any of you now of?

Basically these services would be used to fill the site with some nice starter content so that new users don't visit an empty void in the early stages of release.

If its really simple then something like Amazon Mechanical Turk could work.

More complex then there are a gazillion freelancer sites you could find someone for (oDesk, eLance etc etc etc).

What's your niche - what sort of content do you need?
