We been going back and forth on emails and spoke on phone once. He lives outside of USA. The Angel said he loves the deal, but he won't take the deal seriously unless he has the full scope of the financials (expenses and projections). He has had that info for more that 2 weeks now. In my last email to him I've mentioned that I would like to close in the next 7 days. He said he wants to talk on the phone again. What's next?  How do I prepare?

<p>The phrase "<strong>he loves the deal</strong>" seems like wishful thinking with the proviso "<strong>not serious until he has reviewed the financial details</strong>". </p>

<p>Loving the deal <strong>in principal</strong> isn't the same as sending a check - more due diligence seems to be coming. </p>

<p>Don't know how much more we can guesstimate from a request to call. If you don't have a term sheet or a deposit slip, then it could be anything.</p>

<p>I would be prepared to do a deep dive into your financials, and use the techniques frenchie suggested <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/40797/how-do-i-make-an-angel-investor-move-faster-on-a-deal">in your previous question</a> to try and close the deal. </p>
