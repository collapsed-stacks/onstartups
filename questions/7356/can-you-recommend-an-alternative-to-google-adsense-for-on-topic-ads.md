I am running a website and wish to get some revenues from ads. I tried google Adsense but I do not like the fact that the ads are completely off-topic compared to my site. I checked google adsense faq and it seems you can only block parts of off-topic ads (is that not strange? why can't they proposed ads per category?).

Is there an alternative to google Adsense you would recommend?

1. Don't think that Adsense will show you the same ads that it shows others, the inventory is very location dependent, your visitors may well be seeing very different ads to you.  Also, it does take Google a little while (read an hour or two) to index your site properly and deliver up appropriate content.  There's some tools about to let you see what people from different go locations might see on your site, like : http://www.webtoolhub.com/tn561376-google-adsense-preview.aspx

2. Adsense has the largest inventory of ads to display of any other advertiser bar none, if they don't have on-context ads to display then it's a fair bet that no other ad provider will either.

3. If you do want to try someone else then Google is your friend, "adsense alternatives" brought up a good list of things for you to look at.  The usual suspects from when I was in the Adsense game seem to be still about, Adbrite, Clicksor, Bidvertiser, YPN, and Chikita.

4. If you find that the rest of these providers don't have suitable matching inventory for your site then the alternative approach is for you to approach potential advertisers directly and sell them ads.

<p>For blogs at least, there are a number of different blog ad networks that cater to specific subjects, for example <a href="http://web.blogads.com/advertise/liberal%5Fblog%5Fadvertising%5Fnetwork" rel="nofollow">Liberal Blog Advertising Network</a>, <a href="http://web.blogads.com/" rel="nofollow">BlogAds</a> in general, check out <a href="http://www.projectwonderful.com/" rel="nofollow">Project Wonderful</a>, <a href="http://www.adbrite.com/" rel="nofollow">AdBrite</a>. I'm sure there's more.</p>

I have used influads.com on several of my sites and have yielded great results! It is only one Ad, but they are visually appealing and have a great payout per click.

The reason that you are having trouble with buysellads.com is probably because they only like dealing with sites that get more then 100,000 page impressions a month. If that is your case, then I dont know why they didn't approve you.

If anyone knows of any other sites please let me know!

Cheers!

If it will work for you or not, only you can find out.

What you're looking for is called better optimization and targeting. Most ad networks offer an example of the different "channels" or demographics they can target on their websites, and can sometimes be further customized regarding the ad content, geographical location, and even time of day!

Bad optimization causes irrelevant ads, therefore a worse CTR and eCPM.
