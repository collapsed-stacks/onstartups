As long as you are just on your H1-B, you can't have any active management role with the company you are purchasing. You are not allowed to work in any way for it. Once your pending green card gets you advance parole and EAD, then you can do whatever you want.

Since your immigration status is not solid yet, personally I would wait before buying this business. If anything goes wrong, you could lose a lot of money due to your limited work authorization. If you have an extended family who are ready to work and fix that business if need be, then go ahead and be a passive owner.

Sat, what is your time horizon? A [visa-free startup incubator](http://blueseed.co) is going to launch off the coast of Silicon Valley in Q3 2013.  [Disclaimed: I'm the CIO of Blueseed]
