I have created a small application/tool, and I would like to release it to the public under those conditions:

- It is free. (donations are welcome)
- It is closed source.
- _In the future, I might create a different version with extra options and charge a small fee for it. (this might not be relevant to this question, just adding all information)_ 

The closest I found was this: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/ - Which is perfect for what I want, but it is not recommended to be used in applications or source code.

How should I license my software ?

Since it's closed source most typical product companies don't release any specific licensing details with their software.  There may be some terms of service, or something like that but if it's closed source the default is that people have no right to re-purpose it or sell it, or try to modify it.  Just because you release it for $0 versus $250 makes no difference. It's your copyright, you created it, you invented it. The default would not give anyone else any right to do anything with it other then use it as you have outlined.  I don't think most of the licensing you find online is going to be tailored to a commercial situation like this.

There are hundreds of thousands of freeware programs out on the internet with exactly the same restrictions as you propose. Just pick a topic and do a Google search for "freeware XYZ". Download a few of them and look at their licenses.

Make sure you include a license with every copy you distribute. If you simply says it's free you might find out at a later date that someone is doing something with your package that you don't like, and you essentially gave them permission to do so.

<p>The CC 3.0 is indeed not good for code. You're better off using a simple software license. The fact that the application is free is irrelevant. I think this <a href="https://www.docracy.com/5207/software-licensing-agreement" rel="nofollow">annotated sample</a> is a good starting point, but there are <a href="https://www.docracy.com/doc/showalltagged?page=1&amp;tag=license" rel="nofollow">others</a>. If it looks overly complicated for your app you could probably get away with some basic terms of service. I'm a strong supporter of "smart copying" of terms of service. Go take a peak at your biggest competitor's TOS and write yours, adding some language like "the product is now free, but can't guarantee it will stay free forever". If you start getting traction, definitely hire a lawyer to review your terms.</p>

This is not a free application, it is freeware. And, if you plan to offer a paid version later, then it is more akin to Shareware.

Since those terms are from the age of dinosaurs, it's easier to see your application as commercial software which base price is $0. Treat it as any other commercial piece of software.
