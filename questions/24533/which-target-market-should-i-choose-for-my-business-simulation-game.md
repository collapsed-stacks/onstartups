I'm working on a startup idea that teaches individuals about entrepreneurship through video game simulation, kind of like The Sims open for business but for startups.

I keep going back and forth on the audience I should reach.  Currently, I have obtain positive feedback from professors at universities such as Harvard, Delaware, Virgina to name a few.  

However part of me feels there is a market for B2C, via mobile and web.  If I got B2B targeting universities and high schools I could charge a certain price per student.  If I got B2C, I may offer it for free and incorporate in-game advertising or charge $5 or less for it.

Any feedback I would greatly appreciate it.

I would try to do both of those ideas.  I suspect that the two versions would end up being slightly different to meet the unique needs of the universities.  But I think going after two different marketing channels like you described is a great way to get started.  Once you get really rolling it will probably become obvious that you should either keep going after both channels or dump the one that isn't doing nearly as well as the other.  

Sounds like a great idea.  Good luck!

I would suggest that you make this into an online course in itself. To retake the course students would have to repay the fee. In this way you could limit the number of retries. A university could choose to offer this online course as a part of their degree if it is good enough.

Dave & David wonderful feedback!  I recently starting thinking I should aim at both and measure what type of traction I get and you both just confirmed it for me.  Also, quick question for you two, if I offer it B2C like a game online and/or via mobile would you guys play it?  I know I didn't disclose the details of the idea, but I just wanted to get your gut reaction.  If so, would you like it for free or would you be willing to pay for it?  Please share true honestly.

Thanks again for you insight!!
