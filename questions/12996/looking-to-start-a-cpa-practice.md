I have an accounting degree from New Zealand (many years ago!) but have never used it as a qualified accountant here in California just as a business consultant.

I want to get my CPA license and start a CPA firm, any tips on what school to go to get the required courses, online/brick and mortar?

Also once I sit the CPA exam is that it or do I have to be an intern somewhere?

Thanks,

<p>You do have to fulfill CPA supervised general accounting experience requirements before you can sit for the exam. The <a href="http://www.dca.ca.gov/cba/" rel="nofollow">California Board of Accountancy website</a> and <a href="http://www.dca.ca.gov/cba/publications/handbook.pdf" rel="nofollow">this booklet</a> will answer many of your questions.</p>

<p>Relationships and contacts are really important in this field so I would recommend a brick and mortar school rather than an online pursuit. I don't have advice on a specific institution. </p>
