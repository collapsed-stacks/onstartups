An online company, targeting very small business sellers, the target audience can sign up for a newsletter as well as download a variety of valuable content (guides, etc.) as well as request information from us. Want to be economical in cost. 

Suggestions?

Greatly appreciate it,

<p><a href="http://www.sugarforge.org/" rel="nofollow">SugarCRM Community Editio</a>n is free and it should answer your needs. Create a lead form to let people sign up for the newsletter, then send newsletters through the "campaigns" module.</p>
