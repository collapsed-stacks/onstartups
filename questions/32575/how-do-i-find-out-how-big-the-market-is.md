I see it come up over and over again, like this is a 2$ billion market, we are in a 3$ billion market, etc...

Where do you find this data? I've been searching and it's really hard to google something that makes sense.

<p>I did a bit of searching and for the US you have access to various statistics out of Census: <a href="http://www.census.gov/econ/census07/www/get_data.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/econ/census07/www/get_data.html</a>.
The data is from 2007 with 2012 being the next census year. You can drill down in to industry and sector to view sales data - for example <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IBQTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=&amp;-fds_name=EC0700A1&amp;-ds_name=EC0744I1&amp;-_lang=en" rel="nofollow">Retail Sales</a>.</p>

<p>There are organisations such as <a href="http://www.gartner.com/" rel="nofollow">Gartner</a>, <a href="http://www.forrester.com" rel="nofollow">Forrester</a> and <a href="http://www.ibisworld.com/" rel="nofollow">IBIS</a> that produce reports and inside they quote figures on industry sizes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these reports are expensive to purchase, but often you get the market size quoted in news reports. Some canny searching in Google News might get you figures: include Gartner/Forrester/IBIS in your search term and you might get lucky.</p>

<p>You could also try and find somebody at college/University who has a login to the databases on the library web site. Sometimes you get lucky and can to the IBISWorld database and a selection of reports are available.</p>
