I have a business degree along w/16 yrs Accounting experience as well as being an artist.  I would like to open a company in a busy tourist area (international) selling only a customized local product & support their local artist.  One product is popular here in the US yet would be customized using only their farm land.  Their artist would be supported in a similar fashion to the US as well.  The currency conversion is double the US dollar.  Even though the start-up company would truly be "customizing" a foreign product/service, would having a BBA in accounting, being an artist, and the currency conversion provide more value for international angel investing?  Or would it be of best interest to find one in the specific country?  Thank you for your assistance.

You are missing the key here. One of the most important things investor want to see is PASSION. Do you have that and can you prove it? Would you do anything it takes to keep the business afloat? 

Being an accountant is not going to add much. You can get good accountants nowadays for $10 a day, plus your business doesn't seem to be too complicated accountingwise. 

Investors usually wanna see some revenue generation before they get involved. Do you have some sales figures already? My advice would be to try to get funding from the 3 famous Fs: Family, Friends, and Fools.
