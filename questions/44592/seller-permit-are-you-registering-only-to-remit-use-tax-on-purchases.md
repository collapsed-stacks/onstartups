I am registering for seller permit (or resale license) in the state of NC in order for me to sell drop ship product on a website. 

The application from NC DOR asks "are you registering only to remit use tax on purchases". What is the meaning of this please ?

Thanks

This refers to remitting taxes on items purchased out of state for the use of your business.  Commonly known as the "Sales & Use Tax".
