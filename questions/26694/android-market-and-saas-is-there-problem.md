I'm working on industry specific software. Basic idea is that I have big fat server somewhere, some web app. and mobile clients.

Now I started to think about legal parts of this model.

Reading Google [Market Agreement][1] and see this:

> 3.3 You may also choose to distribute Products for free. If the Product is
> free, you will not be charged a
> Transaction Fee. You may not collect
> future charges from users for copies
> of the Products that those users were
> initially allowed to download for

> Product: Such free trials for Products

> through the Payment Processor on the
> Market. In this Agreement, "free"
> means there are no charges or fees of

**All fees received by Developers for Products distributed via the Market must be processed by the Market's Payment Processor**

Nice? So, what should I do? My idea was to bill customers monthly (does Market allow that?) - plus Android is just a client to my bigger sistem. I pay for servers, I have other software running..

Is that gray area? Market for me is a convinient way to distribute app (also it won't be a problem to just host APK myself) and getting word out is not a bad thing. People finding this client, get interested (potentially)..

And than there is:

> 4.5 Non-Compete. You may not use the Market to distribute or make available
> any Product whose primary purpose is
> to facilitate the distribution of
> Products outside of the Market

Do I understand correctly that I better steer off of Market? Please don't send me to lawyer. I don't feel like getting one involved at this stage, I'm just thinking about future...

<p>From a similar question on <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Android%20Market/thread?tid=588c37c3f334107d&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google's support forum</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our policies are intended to protect
  users from a situation where an app is
  listed for free, but then actually
  requires a payment inside the app in
  order for it to function. However, we
  recognize that some companies may
  offer an existing paid service - for
  example, a cable television provider -
  and would like to offer their
  subscribers access to the service from
  an Android application. So this is
  written into our policies. Please note
  that this is a general guideline and
  we can't comment on specific cases.</p>
