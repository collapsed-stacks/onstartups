<p><a href="http://founderresearch.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Noam Wasserman's "Founder Frustrations" blog</a> has some excellent content that is based on research covering many companies.  This means that the content often is more objectively "valid" than what you get from a blog that simply represents a single person's insights and experiences.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed Marc Andreesen's old blog which had some excellent entries on startups, funding structure, etc - but seems to have disappeared off the net so I can't link to it any more...</p>

<p>Tricky question, because it will obviously depend on your field. For me (web development, but those blogs actually are broader than that):</p>

<p>In order of importance:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">Joel on software</a> : The king, such an inspiration.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">Coding Horror</a> : Very frequent posts, and great tweeter account.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn" rel="nofollow">Signal vs Noise (37 signals)</a> : huge audience, always throwing points to make you think.</p>

<p>I cannot be without most of them. Dharmesh's <a href="http://www.onstartups.com" rel="nofollow">OnStartup</a>'s is a great one, but now I am hooked with this answer's site, even if it's not a blog. I guess as time evolves the quality of a blog changes too. That is why I found the need to start an aggregator selecting top content in one place at <a href="http://www.Paper.io" rel="nofollow">Paper</a> .</p>

<p>Godin is solid, but <a href="http://sivers.org/" rel="nofollow">Derek Sivers' website</a> is a goldmine. His <a href="http://sivers.org/book" rel="nofollow">summaries of business books</a> are amazing and extremely useful.</p>

I'll add to the excellent list above:

http://venturehacks.com/
http://500hats.typepad.com/
http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/
http://blog.simeonov.com/
http://andrewchenblog.com/
http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/

Obviously I'll second Onstartups, blog and this site, Joel's blog and their forum, and Paul Graham's essays.

<p>I really like Neil Patel over at <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/" rel="nofollow">Quicksprout</a>. A close second is Dharmesh's <a href="http://www.onstartups.com/" rel="nofollow">OnStartups</a>. If <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/" rel="nofollow">Answers</a> counted as a blog, then that would be my number one. It just sucks me in because of all the great contributors and questions.</p>
