Previously I used to get lots of prank calls/mobile calls after I give out my business cards at conferences.

I've recently gotten a new phone and a new number and I'm seriously considering whether or not to put the new number on my new card.

Is there any pros and cons of leaving them out? Do you leave your phone number out?

If you're in the USA, you could also use Google Voice for this. Get a google voice number, forward it to your mobile number, and put it on your business cards. That would allow you to do filtering, blocking, quiet times, etc.

I wouldn't, for the simple fact that your mobile number can change again in the future, meaning new biz cards and old calls getting "not in service" messages. My suggestion would be to use a service like Google Voice or Halloo. These give you a virtual number that you can then distribute, and handle in different ways, based on your preferences. For example, you could have that number go to a voicemail box you could check through at will; each service has different options, but you often can look in the web-based interface to see a list of numbers and play back messages quickly. You could then return calls or just delete, without dealing with crazy interfaces some cell providers give you.  Or you could direct that number to different target numbers like your cell or a secretary or something, as you desire.  I would recommend a paid service, mainly because Google can kill free projects at will and leave you in a bad spot - though paid services can sometimes do so too. I personally have used both, and do recommend them.

But check these different services out, or look for a different one under the search term 'virtual phone services'.   Hope this helps!

[EDIT - I would like to add, you definitely want to provide an easy way to reach you for clients. Having a provider that picks up the phone or returns calls quickly every time will win you a lot of bonus points and keep that trust that you care and are there when they need you! ]

Do you carry 2 mobile phones or 1 ?   
If 2, there is not that much to do. If you only have 1, get one more for business only and close after working hours.

One solution you may wish consider is to obtain a Skype account AND Skype phone number.   Use this Skype number as your primary business line or your private "desk" line.  No one knows it's a Skype number.  Forward your Skype number to whichever phone you choose, or answer from your PC during normal hours.  There are a number of services available in addition to simple call forwarding, such as automated attendant and voice mail to name a few.   The best part it's reasonably cheap -- $6/mo from what I recall --

Hope it helps...
