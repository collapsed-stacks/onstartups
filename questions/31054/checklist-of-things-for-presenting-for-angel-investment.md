In no particular order - this is a braindump!

- **Know your business model**
  - You need a valuation of your business; intimately know your numbers
  - Project how the business will perform going forwards (sales assumptions)
  - Understand what you need to do in order to get the business to the next milestone
  - Business defensibility (what stops others just copying you)
- **Know your competition**
  - How big are they
  - What is their turnover
  - How mature are they (still growing?)
- **Know your product**
  - Product margin
  - Product defensibility
- **Know your market/customers**
  - Why will they buy your product
  - Evidence that potential customers like your product
  - How big is the market (in terms of $$$'s) and how much do you intend to take and how?
- **What are you going to do with the angel money?**
  - Compelling reasons why you need extra investment
- **How is the investment going to generate a return for the investor?**
  - At the end of the day the Angel is looking for a return on their investment.  A chunky return.  Be clear in your own mind how this will happen.
- **Why should they invest in me???**
  - Investors, especially Angels, will invest in the person as much as the business.  Make yourself as investable as possible.  Knowing your stuff inside-out and having buckets of passion and a walk-thru-walls attitude is a great start.

And if there is not definite answer (i.e. projected sales) err on the optimistic side.
