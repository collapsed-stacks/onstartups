I want to integrate (finally) a blog into our site (blog.domain.com) and also add a forum. I'd really like to avoid having my team build it. What are potential solutions that you can recommend that we could license to incorporate into our site?

Greatly appreciate it!

Wordpress is pretty simple as well to get set up, and the functionality enhancements are great. Also lots of documentation and support communities to help get it set up and done properly.

WordPress is a great blogging platform.

For a discussion forum, I'd recommend something like Simple Machines Forum (www.simplemachines.org). However, if you're just jumping into this now, be careful with the forum - it takes a lot of hard work and nurturing to build up momentum, and it can be a disheartening process if you don't have the time available.

1+ Joseph. You should use Wordpress

though, if you use any forum software like Mybb, Vbulletin, SMF or, IPB.. you can add plugins to have portal/blog..

That might solve your problem ;)

You could also look into Joomla and Drupa, those are open source content management / blog / forum platforms, quite easy to set up.
