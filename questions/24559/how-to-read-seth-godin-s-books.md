I am reading his blogs for past 4-6 months and I very much like his writing.  

Now I have decided to start reading his books.  But it looks like, he had written quite a good number of books.  So I am not sure which book I should read first. Is there any reading order should I follow ?  for example,  read the **Purple Cow** first then move on to **Linch Pin** next and like wise.

I highly appreciate your suggestions in this regard.

Have a good day!

I have been reading his blog/books for over 4 years now. I don't think there is any sequence for any of his books. 
 
For me, almost all his writings are worth in gold. Just start from any topic you're interested in.
