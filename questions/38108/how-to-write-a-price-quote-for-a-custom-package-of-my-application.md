## How to write a price quote for a 'Custom Package' of my application?

I've built a web application for small business.
I've started monetizing it by adding a White Label package and a Custom Package.
I've had several customers requesting a price quote.

I am looking for a good template that will look professional.!
The template needs to fit my product as a small web application (no more than 2 pages, tops, for example).

Thanks

If it is that important, don't go for a "professional template", get a designer and an UX expert and work with them closely to build it.
That will get you a perfect fit for your product.
