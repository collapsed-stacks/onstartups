Given an offer to join an established company, earning at least a couple of million a year in revenue (under 10 employees) and which is a subsidiary to a multi billion dollar parent company; what is a reasonable amount of equity to expect or be offered? 

The project I would be expected to complete is large and complicated and could damage the company significantly it if it goes wrong (A port of their entire codebase).

There has been mention that 10% of the company has been put aside as employee options. How does someone go about determining how much equity is fair?

Founder's type of equity is/should be a non-option at this point. The risk is relatively low.

If you are coming on as a salaried employee, as a long-term, key and/or a high-level one, the company may be interested in incentives to get you hired. This means a really small share of equity < 1%, or much more likely, some sort of stock option plan where you don't get equity, but are given the chance to buy at a preferential rate from that allocated pool .Otherwise, it's just salary, and for a somewhat important role, it may be a higher-than-average salary to make the search faster and more fruitful.
