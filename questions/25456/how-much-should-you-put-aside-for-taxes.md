I have an LLC located in the US. As I've never done this before, I'm wondering what is a good rule of thumb concerning a percentage of revenue to put aside for taxes?

Our LLC is based in Texas, we have no employees and two managing members and no inactive members. This is our first year in business, so from what I understand we start paying quarterly next year after we know what our revenue is this year.

It's a very complicated answer that depends on many different variables.

You should find yourself an accountant fast. He/she will walk you through all the tax issues you will have and help you with paperwork and filing taxes correctly.

I know it can seem like a costly thing to have to get but trust me when I tell you that the money you spend on professional help is a lot less then screwing things up and having the gov't come after you because you didn't do your taxes correctly.
