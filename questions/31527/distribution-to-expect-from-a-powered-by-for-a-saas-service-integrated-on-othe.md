## Distribution to expect from a "powered by" for a SaaS service integrated on other websites?

we are working on a saas application.
Say it is a SaaS for small size businesses, that will integrate our Saas on their websites and will get immediate value out of it.

We plan to create a basis free package, that will include our branding like "powered by StartupName"  at the bottom. So the assumtion is:

**Since the competition is observing each other, the small branding will serve automatically as indirect advertising for us.** The surrounding competitive enterprises of our first customer, will take over our system if they are innovative enough.

I think lots of SaaS solutions are doing it that way. 

**My question is, how much distribution should I expect from it? Is it very low, or decent, can I count on it as valuable advertising channel?**

Thanks in advance,

Denis.

Will it help, certainly yes, if only for the search engine link benefit of raising your sites profile.

 Is it quantifiable, no. I would guess reasonably low traffic but for the cost to you (almost nothing) you have nothing to lose. It may also help convert basic users to premium to get rid of the link.
