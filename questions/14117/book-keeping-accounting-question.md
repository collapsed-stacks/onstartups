**Example**
You are a Service business, your customer pays you $100 for "Service X" via credit card.
You charge the customer an additional 2% of total sale for paying via Creditcard.

Hence the total the customer will pay you is $102.

Your bank charges you a merchant service fee, 1.5% of total sale and your credit card gateway charges you $0.25 per transaction.

So for a sale of $102, you pay $1.53 + $0.25 = $1.78

You make $100 for Service X, you also make $2.00 - $1.78=$0.22 on the credit card fee!

Now how do you record this?

1) 

Service X = +$100

Other Revenue = +$2.00

Bank Service Fee = $1.78

Credit Card Gateway Fee = $0.25

OR

2) 

Service X = +$100

Other Revenue = +$2.00

then record the bank fee, and gateway fee separately, not actually calculating the actual amount charged from the transaction.

A word of warning- you should carefully check the wording of your merchant credit card agreement. **Most merchant accounts strcitly prohibit you from charging an extra fee to accept a credit card.**

I usually use the second method, as I don't like keeping track of every single fee, especially when processing more than just a couple. At the end of each month, I just total the fees I had to pay to various businesses (bank, payment gateway) and enter it as one line.
