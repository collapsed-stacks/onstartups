I've come to an employment agreement with a startup company and they've sent me a copy of our agreement to look over and sign. I can't afford to get a lawyer to take a look at it, but I would like to know if there are certain things that I should watch out for in the agreement. 

If anyone with experience in this can take a look at this for me, it would be really helpful. 

Thanks

Jane - you don't say anything about what the agreement relates to, whether it is an employment agreement or consulting agreement or something else.

I'm not a lawyer but I've done a lot of contract work through previous roles.  I'd be happy to provide feedback on a practical level - my email is in my profile.

Hopefully there are others on the forum with more legal experience than I that could give you their perspective too.
