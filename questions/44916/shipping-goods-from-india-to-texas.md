<p>You will definitely have to pay the <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/trade_programs/duty_rates/" rel="nofollow">Import Duty</a> and you can look at the same website or <a href="http://www.dutycalculator.com/" rel="nofollow">Duty Calculator</a> to estimate how much that would be.</p>

<p>As far as India export taxes are concerned you can take a look at the <a href="http://business.gov.in/taxation/export_procedure.php" rel="nofollow">Export procedure taxation website</a> to get some idea but unless you are planning to do this yourself I would either contract with a shipper that would handle the procedures for you.  Or have the manufacturer bake in the export taxes (if any) directly into the cost of the garments they ship you.</p>

<p>I would also contract with a customs clearing agents here in the US like <a href="http://www.clearedanddelivered.com/" rel="nofollow">Cleared and Delivered</a> (used as an example only) to handle your customs clearance and delivery to distribution site.</p>
