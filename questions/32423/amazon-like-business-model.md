<p>There is also a short video <a href="http://businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
It is from the <a href="http://businessmodelgeneration.com/" rel="nofollow">http://businessmodelgeneration.com/</a> and here is their <a href="http://businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/businessmodelgeneration_preview.pdf" rel="nofollow">book preview</a>. Is this what you meant ?</p>
