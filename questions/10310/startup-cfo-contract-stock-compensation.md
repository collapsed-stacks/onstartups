you might found already a sample contract, like the one posted at http://contracts.onecle.com/adventrx/plumb.svc.2003.01.20.shtml

However, the compensation might be what you decide. It depends on your financial abilities and on your funding sources. If you are funded by venture capital, your financier might like to be asked about what compensation you offer to a CFO.

On the other hand, it might not even necessary to hire a full time CFO. If you only need some advice or someone who reviews your financial statements and prepares some planning or presentation things, than it might be enough to hire a part time CFO.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Stephan

OneCLE provides a lot of free sample (empirical) contracts. If you have a LexisNexis or Westlaw account, you can download some better ones and even drafting guides.

For CFO compensation data and analysis, see: https://www.compstudy.com/. The 2009 Summary Report can be retrieved from here: https://webforms.ey.com/content/vwWFPreview/US/en/2009_Comp_study_report_in_technology?OpenDocument


Found a new data source:
http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/05/01/how-much-should-you-pay-an-executive-in-a-startup-company/

CFO average equity in IT startups is: 1.01%


I remember something similar on VentureHacks and Payscale
