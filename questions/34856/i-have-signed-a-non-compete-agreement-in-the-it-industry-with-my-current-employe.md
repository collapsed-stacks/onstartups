What if I make my father register the business?

Can the employer close the business if my father will be the legal owner of the business?

I am in Canada and my contract allow me to work as employee , so I thought I ll register it by the name of my father and work at my father as employee so he cant stop me

What country are you in?  Your non-compete agreement probably also say that you can't work for a competing IT business.

In any case, lawyer familiar with your jurisdiction reading your contract is really the only way to know for sure.

Maybe it's time to either quit or talk to your employer about your new idea and see if they want to do it with you.

As long as you aren't involved with the business your father owns, you aren't violating your non-compete agreement. However, if you even try to discuss the operations with your father, you will be violating it and will be held accountable for the breach of contract.

Although the burden of proof of non-compete agreement violations lies on the employer, few secrets stay secrets during discovery. Don't try to be the wise guy covering up the tracks as that will aggravate your position in the court when it comes down to it.
