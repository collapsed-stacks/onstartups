I have started a comparison website for electronic consumer goods vendors, the website is ready, but I am having a problem getting in touch with someone whom I can speak to . I've tried asking for a connection through social media page, through contactus email on the site, now I'm trying linkedin. Is there anyway where I can get a connection in the these companies and get a response, besides the sources I have mentioned?

I can only assume that most of the people you want to talk to have phone numbers. That's pretty direct. Just call the companies and ask to speak to the necessary people.

To get in touch with other companies for your business you will need -

1. Use social media(facebook/twitter/linkedin/google plus etc.) for promoting yourself and to provide the knowledge for what you are and what you want to achieve with your business
2.  If the desired company with which you want to connect has a website then you can use there contact us form - fill in the form try to be specific with your motive and give it a chance.
3. Use the contact information such as company office number or email and at least try to get an appointment with right person so you can discuss what you want with that person.
4. An email campaign is also helpful for promoting or reaching out to the people which you want
