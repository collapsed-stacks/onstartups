If you're based in U.S., it is not very hard to get in touch with the right people in order to transform an idea into a product. It's easy to get to conferences, to apply to different startup programs etc. But what about *entrepreneurs-wannabes* from other countries (an European country, for example)?

I'm sure there are a lot of smart people around the world, capable of having great product ideas, who at least once asked themselves: "*How would it be to get to Silicon Valley and make this thing happen?*". But how hard is to make that possible? What are the chances for some non-U.S. founders to make themselves heard and get to Silicon Valley, the place where a startup idea is always welcomed and has the most chances to obtain funding and fully benefit of networking?

Supposing you have a potentially-awesome idea, which are the biggest obstacles to getting to Silicon Valley? Are there any relevant examples of people who made it in a situation like this?

<p>It is difficult as sometimes the USA gives the impression that overseas entrepreneurs are just like people who sneak across the US-Mexico border in the middle of the night. Fortunately, this is changing, with the <a href="http://startupvisa.com/" rel="nofollow" title="Link to startupvisa.com site">Startup Visa initiative</a>, etc.</p>

<p>I'm in the UK and would love to start my next technology business in Silicon Valley, but it is very difficult to get a suitable visa (I want to do it legally, not by any dubious means).</p>

<p>Alternatively, it is possible that you have a good start-up ecosystem near you.</p>
