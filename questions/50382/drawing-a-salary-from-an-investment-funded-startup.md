This is the situation:
I am close to securing funding for a startup (from an investment group) who will get 32% equity for their cash. I retain the other 68% as the MD.

Having never been involved with investors before i am unsure how the investors will expect me to be paid.
Obviously wages are seen as a general business expense, so should i just decide on a basic salary and start paying myself from the off? is this something that is beaten out in the final paperwork before finalising the investment?


As you all regularly say... I'm not a lawyer!!
