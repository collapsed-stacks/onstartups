I have a small online retail store, making products for R/C hobbyists. The advantage of my product is that it is made in the USA out of quality aircraft aluminum, versus the competition, which is uniformly made in Asia out of cheap plastic. It would be a huge break for me if I could get my products carried in my local hobby store, even if it meant selling them nearly at cost. Are there any guidelines or suggestions for approaching said hobby store to see if they would be interested in carrying them? Any idea what I might expect in terms of what they would demand in a contract, provided that they are interested?

You could start visiting the hobby shop regularly and get to know the owner on a first name basis. Then you could ask him to evaluate a product you are considering producing because you value his knowledge in the industry.

Alternately, get ten of your RC hobbyist friends to go in this week and ask the owner for what you are selling. They have to make clear they want an aluminum one not plastic. After the tenth, go in and show the owner what you have and how it's better.

If he buys some, make sure some of your friends go in and buy.
