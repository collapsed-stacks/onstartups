I'm developing a startup website like groupon.com for daily deals. I'm located in Nigeria and I have my system developed already. I started marketing it myself, but this business model seems to be new in my country. I don't have much funds, and I'm trying to think of the best way to implement marketing.

I'm comfortable with all the technical work required. However, I want to know how best to go about marketing. Should I have sales teams in all the states I want to operate in? Or should I go with a reseller system where my resellers can create deals on the website for the local businesses? Is this the same marketing strategy groupon.com uses?

Your title talks about marketing but then your description talks about sales.
For sales I'd recommend starting locally before a national role out (unless you are well financed and can afford a rapid national role out). You can then learn what works on a small scale before expanding.

For marketing, to drive your audience, start with:
- paid search
- twitter
- facebook
- display ads
- list buys

I know that the company you mentioned employes a large sales force, and that sales force is pretty highly paid. *(They get a base salary, benefits, and commissions.)*

Strong sales force + some pretty good copywriters. If you have no process in place, perhaps start just in your city, work out the kinks then go regional, before national. As you scale, that just adds complexity and a new set of issues- best to have a handle on the first set before you try.

Most of the daily deal websites market through a variety of channels.  The goal is group buying so many of them use social channels to market - like Facebook and Twitter.  In addition they use Pay-Per-click marketing as well as other online media channels like Pandora.  Once they acquire a new user, they use direct marketing (email) to get their message to their base.  Their business is marketing and they make money when the deals sell, so they spend a decent amount on their marketing.
