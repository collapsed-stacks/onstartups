I'm putting together a business plan for a startup, and I need to provide an estimate for utility costs.  For my plan, this is an office of 12 employees with an average of 2 CPU's per workstation.  Plus there will be a small server room with a half dozen servers plus lighting and kitchen.  This is in the Chicago market.

How do I find out how much this will cost?  Heat/air + electricity for a 2500 sqft office?

Edit: I do not have a particular property in mind.  I'm just doing the business plan to try to secure funding.

That depends where you are located and age of HVAC equipment. In addition, many office leases include HVAC during business hours, but you do pay other utilities. General rule is $2 per square foot per year EXCLUDING HVAC. I never paid tipple-net, but utilities with HVAC on 2500 would like run you $1K per month excluding maintenance on HVAC.

If you have a particular property in mind, ask the current/previous occupants to give you info on what they paid.
