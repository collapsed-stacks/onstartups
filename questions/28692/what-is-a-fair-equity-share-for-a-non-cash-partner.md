I was approached by a friend with a business idea that i really like and would like to invest in (i would invest with another person). The question is, what is a fair equity share to give this person who brought the idea to my attention, and who will also work the business (sweat equity). My other partner and i are also going to work in the business, but not full-time.

One of the solutions we came up with, is to be equal partners (33.3% each), but the partner who didn't have any cash would pay the other two partners back over the course of a year from his share of the business profits (eg: if we invest 60k total, the person would pay us back 20k).

Is this a fair agreement? What other agreements have people seen? One reason against it is that in a year the business could be worth way more than his initial investment. But i want to do the right thing and be fair while also being business savvy. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I would advise a straight split, not the 1:1:1 with one partner "paying you back" over time. After all, as you say, they brought you the idea in the first place, so you might say they've already paid for their share.

As always, it is better to keep things simple. If you believe in the idea, then there's no point in complicating matters up front.
