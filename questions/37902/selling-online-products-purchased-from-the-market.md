Are there any rules and regulations when selling products purchased from the market in an online store?

This is not affiliate/commission based selling. I'm purchasing products for the retail prices available in Asian markets and reselling/shipping to US customers via an ecommerce website. The products are basically tableware, nothing illegal/hazardous. 

My burning question is do we need to have agreements with the retailers/manufacturers if we do so?

For your specific product, no, apart from the normal import/export rules and regulations. But:

 - If the product is considered hazardous -> YES
 - If the product has intellectual rights like music, videos, software, books, you **may** need a written authorization, permission or agreements.
 - If the product is food or medicine  -> YES

More can be found here -> http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/basic_trade

And I would recommend you read it before you start your business.
