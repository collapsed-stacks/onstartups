Starting a vending machine business. Can I put some of the logos of the products I sell on my Van?

I.e. Snickers Logo, Lays logo, Pepsi logo

Thanks
JC

Usually depends on each specific company.  You would be best served to contact the companies whose products you are selling to see how/when/where you are allowed to use their logos for your own promotional purposes.
