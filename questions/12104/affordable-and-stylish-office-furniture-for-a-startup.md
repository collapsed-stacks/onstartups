This question might be slightly off-topic, but I figure many of you have gone through the process of buying office furniture for your startup. I wanted to reach out for advice on where to purchase furniture that is good looking and affordable. 

I know that Ikea is a solid option, but I wanted to see if any of you knew of some alternatives. Thanks.

I've bought a lot of used furniture for companies I was in. You can get used stuff that looks like Herman Miller with same quality and warranty but for much less (even compared to used HM). One brand that I really like is Global ( http://www.globaltotaloffice.com/ ). I've had one chair (out of hundreds) break on me and Global sent me a new one no questions asked.
I would find used furniture dealer you feel comfortable with. Sad truth is that the vast majority of them are VERY like used car sales people - slimy, pushy, misleading, etc.

If you are anywhere within bearable driving distance from Dania Furniture ( http://www.daniafurniture.com ), they have some very reliable and designey furniture. I've bought some of their stuff and it took abuse of hundred plus developers and looked like new.

Re. Ikea. Their tables and shelves have gotten a lot better in quality, but their chairs are really horrible.

I personally love Ikea furniture. It's not the greatest quality, but it is a good price and good value. You can get the functional furniture you need for a fraction the price of higher-end furniture. The only catch is, the furniture tends to be harder to move around, so if you're planning on changing offices frequently, it may not work (moving around a room is not a big deal, but stairs and tight doorways can prove difficult once assembled).

If you can, I would visit one of their showrooms and see if anything strikes your fancy, and go with that. You can often get a more refined look if you see what options are available - much of their wooden furniture comes with a choice of finishes.

The one thing I would not skimp on though is the desk chairs. Considering how much time you spend sitting in it, make sure you find one that's ergonomically correct for you, and feels right. Test out a few before choosing one, and be aware that the cost of a higher-end chair more than pays for itself with savings from physiotherapy and massage therapy bills resulting from bad posture and a chair that doesn't really fit you.

Craigslist. 

If you're patient and in an area with an active business section you can pick up amazing quality office furnishings for a fraction of their original cost. Especially in this tough business environment.

When we doubled our office space about a year ago I bought a number of pieces, including an all glass desk from a closed down design firm. What originally sold for several thousand dollars cost me $200 and an evening to move.

Every city has used office furniture dealers with big warehouses full of fairly typical office furniture -- desks, files, chairs -- at steeply reduced prices.

<p>Recently I discovered <a href="https://www.opendesk.cc" rel="nofollow">OpenDesk</a>.</p>

<p>That website offers "Open Source" furniture. You can take the plans and ask a local carpenter to make it for you or order it directly from them. The plans itself are free. I think these are good looking. At least where I live, hiring a carpenter to build these desks might have a better price than many other options.</p>

Forget "good looking" and go with functional.  (Though in many respects I think looks will follow function, but not the other way around.)

I like the Ikea galant modular desks.  A Herman Miller chair is good as well.  I know that item is considered pricey and a luxury, but it is well worth it.  $200 chairs are a waste of money.

I've had good experiences getting Herman Miller Aeron chairs on eBay.  This is in the UK, though -- it might not work so well where you are.
