I need a materials supplier and have an RFQ put together.  How should I go about distributing to potential suppliers?  Should I track down potential providers and email it to them?  Is there some place I can register them that potential providers would find it?

The first thing you should do is contact the companies you may want to do business with and ask if they want to accept your RFQ. Just sending it cold will not get you much traction. 

I am not aware of any place that you can just post an RFQ. Again, the best way is to go look up the suppliers you want, contact them, ask if they are interested and then send it on.
