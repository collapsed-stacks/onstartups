I might be looking for the impossible. What I want is a program that will allow me to track my ecommerce sales (wordlwide), graphically, create goals, charts, etc, and maybe even have a google-earth plugin that I can customize to my business needs, such as demographic data, market reach, etc. I am looking for this miracle, all-in-one product, but haven't really seen anything. I'm simply looking for a "hub" where I can manage all the information regarding my site. I'm currently doing this through several different programs, and was just wondering if anyone had something that was very dynamic and integrated. Any ideas?

Some good friends of mine with an ecommerce website use http://www.woopra.com/.
It looks very "dynamic" and "integrated" to me, and the live dashboard is sleek. That said, it's hard to tell if it's what you're looking for but the basic package is free.

Have you considered one of the enterprise analytic suites like Omniture, Coremetrics or Webtrends? The primary advantage these offer over the more commonly used tools like Google Analytics is that they can, with some lifting, integrate multiple data sources and sites to roll up into a "global" reporting package. 

Depending on your build [and business] you can do some quite exciting things like track customers across different channels using a common ID, append PRSM and other demographic sources and such.

You can also port in third party tool's like email, customer service and crm to build closer to a 360-view.

Any of these will allow for advanced reporting to segment across region / campaign / etc on an automatic basis.
