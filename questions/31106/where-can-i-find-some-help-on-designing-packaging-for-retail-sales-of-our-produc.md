Graphic designers typically charge big bucks to create a packaging concept.  Then there is the cost of packaging materials that can sometimes cost as much or more than the product.  Does anyone have a resource that could help me do this myself?

I can honestly say there is no substitute for getting your packaging professionally designed as this is fundamentally what sells your product on the shelves and big retailers will often not accept poor design, but as you mention you are at the concept stage you could always work towards hiring someone. To get started I would:

- find template designs that you can customise saves a lot of time, a couple of good books for this: 
    - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Packaging-Design-Templates-Sourcebook-CD-rom/dp/2940361738/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1317886000&sr=8-3  
    - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Structural-Package-Designs-Packaging-Folding/dp/9057680440/ref=pd_sim_b1
- find examples of good design that you can get inspiration from, the best online source is:
    - http://www.thedieline.com/
- get hold of some design tools and make your packaging, the Adobe suite is your best bet (e.g Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop)

<p>If you don't mind the difference in time zones, you can try outsourcing at <a href="http://www.odesk.com" rel="nofollow">odesk</a>. The odesk job market is like ebay where the sellers (service providers) and buyers (employers) rate each other. You can post what your project, specify as much details as possible, deadlines, how much your budget is, etc.</p>

<p>The service providers, upon seeing your job posting will respond to your ad with their credentials as well as a proposal as to how much it will cost you. Give it a try.</p>

<p>Try <a href="http://Covrig.com" rel="nofollow">Covrig.com</a>. They have created some packages at a good cost for my company</p>
