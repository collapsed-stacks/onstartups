According to "The Art of the Start" by Guy Kawasaki, the typical salary for a CEO in a startup is around $125,000 (these are number from 2004 so may be slightly different today). The book also notes that a "CEO should not be paid more than four times its lowest-paid full-time employee."

That being said, it really depends on a lot of other factors including the potential market of your idea, the experience of the CEO, etc.

It depends on the industry and the position of the start up.
Most companies tend to bring in outside CEO's way too early because they think it will help them raise venture capital and instead it just adds to their burn rate. 

I am sure if you elaborate, you will be able to get a better answer.
