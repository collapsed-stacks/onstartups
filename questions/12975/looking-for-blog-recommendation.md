I'm looking for blog software for a new community site we have just launched and have very specific criteria:

1) it must be hosted (where the software is regularly patched for security vulnerabilities)

2) it needs to support multiple contributors with a single account

3) we are happy to pay a reasonable fee to have our own domain, no ads, our own design, etc., but not the $500 /mo that wordpress charges for VIP hosting.

The Wordpress Multi User platform looks very close to what we'd like - for example what TechCrunch has - but the pricing we've seen is beyond our resources for the VIP type accounts.

We were also using movable type before, but found its usability was horribly frustrating and made simple things like displaying .

Recommendations greatly appreciated!

Thanks == Julie

Wordpress Premium services is exactly what you need, based on the specs you provided this service will be sufficient for your blog, at least until you reach millions of users per month for which when you do, you'll want to move to Wordpress VIP hosting which includes the WordPress.com grid (over 1,000 servers in three data centers, 24/7 IT support, CDN, hourly backups).

Check Wordpress Premium services, http://en.wordpress.com/products/ what you pay for this service is much less than what you pay for the VIP hosting.

<p>I don't know what kind of traffic you are getting currently, but Wordpress VIP hosting is used by the blogs that get very heavy traffic. If you ever need to upgrade to Wordpress VIP package, it will be a good problem to have.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking following 2 options</p>

<p>1 Set up a hosted blog on wordpress.com and then upgrade to the premium features that you need. Here is information about wordpress.com's premium features</p>

<p>2 Another option would be to use <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" rel="nofollow">Squarespace</a></p>

<p>I've had reasonable success using Blogger (Google). You can use your own domain name with it.</p>

<p>Multiple users per blog, flexibility on templating, and no advertising. </p>

<p>There's a small bar at the top of the screen, but if the color scheme is chosen correctly it doesn't distract from the corporate message.</p>

<p>e.g. For an example, here is my blog: <a href="http://blog.riskythinking.com/" rel="nofollow">The Risky Thinking Blog</a>. This was done using a custom logo and corporate color scheme, and a very slight modification of one of the supplied templates. </p>

<p>Using Blogger also has the advantage that you know Google will be able to spider your blog correctly and detect when it has been updated! If at the end of the day you move elsewhere, it's possible to download all the content as XML, so you are not totally locked in.</p>
