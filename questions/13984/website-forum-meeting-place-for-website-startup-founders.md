Hacker News is certainly the best place for this to happen "naturally".  My problem with co-founder matching/dating is that it's not something that can be forced.  The best co-founders are people that you've either:

A) Know through a professional or friendly manner.
B) Referred to through a mutual friend.
C) Have worked with before in some capacity.

So the best thing to do is start meeting as many people as possible in a natural setting and co-founders will start coming about.  This is someone you will be spending the next 5-7 years of your life with on a daily basis.  It can't be forced.

I had posted a similar question to yours that I posted yesterday and someone pointed me out to this website which I just tried out today and it looks good.
