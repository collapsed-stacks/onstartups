For quite a while now I have been considering becoming a freelance creative consultant, as I have a gift for new product concept, design and market strategy.

The small local UK manufacturing Company I have work for for 20+ years, in a totally non creative roll, seems to have used an idea I suggested on an emailed, internal job transfer request, to World Acclaim.

After 100+ years in the industry, my employers created a new line of products which tapped into a never before targeted market, I had identified on an internal transfer request. They have since sold over 1 Million units World Wide.

I have received no recognition at all for my contribution.

Any ideas as to my legal position on this?
