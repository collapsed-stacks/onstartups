<p>You need an agreement between a company owner and someone making the product?</p>

<p>or do you need an agreement between two people going in to a business together?</p>

<p>It's hard to just say give me template. Legal contracts are designed to represent the expectations of all of the parties involved and their obligations.  There are situations where template agreements may work but it's best to know what you want to agree upon.</p>

<p>Remember a contract is just text between people that is mutually agreed upon.</p>

<p>Having the text in standard legal language helps with interpretation and enforcement but you can make an agreement between people with any signed and agreed upon terms.</p>

<p>So just write something up that makes sense in your situation, or start with a template and modify it towards your needs.</p>

<p>Or get a lawyer to draft it.</p>

<p>(I'm not a lawyer, this is not legal advise)</p>
