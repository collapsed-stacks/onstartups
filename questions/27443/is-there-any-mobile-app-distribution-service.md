Due to country restrictions and bureaucracy, I can't sell apps on Android Market and Apple Appstore.

There are music distribution services like [TuneCore][1] and [CD Baby][2] that place your music on several music marketplaces. Is there a similar service but for mobile applications?

Actually the Android Market and the Apple Appstore is the distribution service. As most people can use them, there is no real need in a distributor, who eats some of money.

What you could do is the following:

1) Try to find a **App Marketing Service** provider. They already do promo stuff - they might be able to add your app to the stores. I could find some services with google, like:    

  - http://appsmarketing.mobi/services.html
  - http://marketing.comboapp.com/

Sidenote, I have not tried that services. They were just on top of my google results.


2) If you have a **friended app developer** out there, you can ask them. There are many freelancers who are working in that area, you could pay them for putting it online.


But you should consider two things: you need to tell them probably they need to add the app in your name. Better look at the store-restrictions if the distributor can add your name as App creator or if he needs to use his own name as App creator.

Just out of curiosity, maybe you could give me a brief comment about were you are living. I have not heard of trouble like this before.

Cheers,
Christian

You may try

They operate a model similar to groupon (but for mobile apps) where they have a set of people who have signed up to receive notices of new apps being promoted.
