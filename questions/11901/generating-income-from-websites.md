We have a website that lets companies advertise their courses and lessons for free. We currently have adsense on the site to generate income, but this income will not cover the cost of the next development stage. I need to come up with a way of generating income from the site. I have listed a few options below, but what I would like to do is think out of the box here. I really don't want to charge a monthly fee.

 - advertising
 - adsense
 - paid subscriptions
 - commission on sales
 - lead generation fee
 - pay per click
 - donations

<p>@Ross's comment is key here. </p>

<p>You need to decide who your <strong>customers</strong> are going to be. Is it Google, or the people listing courses, or the people who visit the site. </p>

<p>Currently your customer is Google, and what you make will be limited by how popular the Google Adwords categories are that you attract. Obviously this isn't enough at the moment and presents a high risk (single customer, variable keyword values) for the future. Companies offering courses seems a better bet.</p>

<p>If you are just listing courses, you may have a problem convincing the companies listing courses of value. Are you sending them enough worthwhile traffic for them to pay you money? This will depend upon the quality of traffic you attract, and whether the listing companies are able to identify that traffic. </p>

<p>You could push more into the signing-up process (the value of who has signed up and paid for a course is hard to dispute). See <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/" rel="nofollow">www.eventbrite.com</a> for a company doing something similar. You might then be able to sell the booking process, rather than just the listing. This could be free for free courses in return for a link, which would be valuable from a SEO perspective.</p>

<p>You could offer listing companies annual subscriptions (as many courses as you want for $x), pay-per-click, pay-per-purchase (if that can be tracked), first N clicks free (so they can judge the quality of the traffic), first 3 months free, free for non-profits ... anything that will get companies to try the service and ensure that there are always enough listings to interest visitors. </p>

You could sell your publishers premium placement for a fee: If they pay, they get to the top of the list, or on a prominent place near the top of the list (like Google does on its search pages).

I would rather say.. Go for SEO- SEM for your website first instead of planning next development. 

This will bring more traffic to your website and the same way more money. Once you have good funds, you can go for planning next Development.
