I have acquired work in the IT industry for, let's say, $100 an hour. I have a friend who is looking for work that I believe I can subcontract to.

I have a company and infrastructure and did the work to secure the contract which is obviously worth something. At the same time, I won't be providing health, an office, or any other benefits. Assume we have similar skillsets.

I realize this is subjective, but what are reasonable rates to subcontract to him? I guess the fact that we are friends is haunting my conscience, but that really shouldn't factor in, right?

The contract recruiters I have worked through (i.e they have the job and client connection and they sub contract work out to me) charge between 10% and 20%. For that they turn my invoices around in less than 14 days (I work a month, invoice at month end and receive money in my account in less than 14 days).

So to offer the same type of service to your friend is worth between 10-20% without any guilt on your part.

10-20% seems reasonable. Don't forget to cover yourself with appropriate insurance, depending upon the circumstances.

You could do as many agencies do and package up the opportunity as a full time W2 (pseudo-permanent) job It is conceivable that many candidates will prefer a far lower W2 salary that is packaged like a traditional job. 

In the US a salary may be 1/2 to 3/4 of the contracted (billed) rate. After expenses, you could retain the remaining as profit. Example - you could pay the person $85,000 per year for salary, while the contracted rate is more like $200K per annum. 

Obviously you are taking on extra obligations if you were to do this: supplying unemployment insurance, processing payroll, and making tax deposits. 

I concur with the others - the brokering of an existing opportunity has a lot of value and you should not just hand the opportunity over.
