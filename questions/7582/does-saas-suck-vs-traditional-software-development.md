Let's assume one thing. You have NOMNOM ready to be installed on thousands of your clients computers and used, but oh wait, you catch the SaaS bandwagon, and decide to prdocue NOMNOM.COM and make people pay 1/12th for it.

Saas Sucks because

compared to your Traditional Desktop Software development.....

   1. SaaS takes more time & effort to make because you have to account for scalability.
   2. SaaS takes more money because you have to invest in some servers and hardware.
   3. SaaS takes more equity selling (basically u losing ownership partially to VCs, "BFF").
   4. SaaS takes more ass kissery because your customers can always cancel subscriptions.
   5. SaaS takes more debt cuz you have to wait till you get positive cash flow & critical mass.

I would argue that SaaS > Traditional Desktop Software, except for applications that can't easily offload processing power to the server (i.e. gaming, video editing). Here is why:

- SaaS takes **less** time & effort to make even when you account for scalability.
- SaaS eliminates piracy.
- SaaS eliminates painful upgrades.
- SaaS allows for faster iterations and release cycles. 
- SaaS being subscription based allows for a more predictable revenue stream.
- SaaS leverages web standards and let's you "write once, run everywhere."
- SaaS centralizes information. You can login from wherever you wish to.
- SaaS allows easier integration with other applications and social features.

<ol>
<li>There are better tools now, but
supporting the distribution and
installation of an application
really sucks. You'll lose sales if they can't get help with installation. Just be thankful for the Internet. </li>
<li>You do have to invest in servers
and hardware, so your customers
don't (See #1). For a large-scale app, you'll be doing the installation.</li>
<li>No Comment</li>
<li>Ever had a client ask for a refund
after using your app for 8 months?
How about renewing that service
agreement? </li>
<li>If I bought an application, I would
want a longer trial period. For enterprise level software, everyone is going to want payment terms. You don't hire a building inspector when you rent a house.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you've got me thinking of the good-ol'-days of mailing floppies, burning CD's and paying long-distance fees to use PCAnywhere with your 56K modem. And don't forget to wait for your client to swap the phone line from fax machine to their pc.</p>

<p>Then again, I'm thankful I wasn't a <a href="http://www.coghead.com" rel="nofollow">Coghead</a> subscriber.</p>

I would disagree.

 - SaaS is good because you don't have to deal with multiple versions of the application
 - SaaS is good because users never need to follow complex upgrade paths... it just happens
 - SaaS is good because users can access from anywhere... at work, at home, overseas
 - SaaS is good because (depending on your setup) you can access via mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry, etc.)
 - SaaS is good because you can easily "push" notifications to any/all of your users and ensure they get them
 - SaaS is good because hackers can't decompile/pirate your S/W
 - SaaS is good when dealing with Enterprise software. No one wants to commit to $1M+ up front, but a $5,000/mo. fee is a much easier sell.

PS I've been building/working on SaaS apps for the best part of the last decade.

Use both. Each has its own revenue stream and advantages. For example, there's TurboxTax desktop edition and you can file online. Intuit makes money for both. Microsoft sells desktop applications and has Azure for cloud computing. The upcoming MS Office can be used online and as a client desktop software. 

Keep your options open.

Are you asking a question or making a statement?  It seems like the latter since you're debating all of the answers you receive.

From a sales and marketing perspective, the advantages to SaaS can be huge.  Online solutions require less up-front capital investment and less infrastructure from customers, meaning they can adopt it more easily at an individual or departmental rather than enterprise level.  The challenges to enterprise sales have already been well documented, but they include expensive direct salespeople, extremely long sales cycles, and challenging account planning.  SaaS doesn't entirely resolve these issues, but it can make them much less difficult.  So, especially for many startups, selling subscription software should be pretty much a no-brainer compared to traditional packaged software.
