I'm not looking for a digital wallet, but rather a service with an API that we could use to let people who use our app make payments to others using our app (iOS/Android)

Does this service exist yet?

Im not aware of anyone offering this, but I would get in contact with Venmo. At the moment, it doesn't look like they offer any APIs; but perhaps they would be open to hearing ideas about P2P payments within 3rd-party apps. As it stands, the service is easy and cheap (no transaction fees) and you can send money via text message or their own iOS/Android/BB apps. They have the functionality you're probably looking for, should be an interesting prospect for them to consider at least.

I am not sure if this is allowed from the Apple In-App-Payment policies, but Paypal has a pretty ok API. You could use that to transfer money.

I recommend you that reading:

Maybe that is of help too
