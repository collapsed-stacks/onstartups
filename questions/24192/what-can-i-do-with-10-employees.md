I live in DR, here the wage is very low, so I can get 10 employees at very low price (High school education/University student, good English, good typing skills, word/excel/etc knowledge, what else?). 

I was thinking in doing data entry, but my research tells me that data entry pays less than the wage here! (Less than $1/h).

I need something I can charge at least $3/h for each employee so I can see some money.

What do you recommend? 

(I'm not sure if my question is ambiguous or inappropriate. I would remove the question if it is.)

<p>I think you best bet is to look at <a href="http://www.odesk.com" rel="nofollow">oDesk</a>, eLance and Mechanical Turk. They all have a huge range of job catagories, I'm sure you can find a niche on them.</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup a company and put a little time into defining the roles.</li>
<li>Have 1 or 2 of your 10 chasing the jobs on these websites.</li>
<li>Employ the  others doing the work being won. </li>
<li>Have someone (you) make sure they are followed up and the client is happy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Build the reputation of the company on the sites and make sure you get good feedback (and give it as well). </p>

<p>If you can organise these people that way you stand to earn more than $3 per hour for your people and for yourself. </p>

<p>I think your key success factor is being able to raise the overall wages of everyone in your company while still making a good margin. This will keep your people happy and ensure your continuing quality and reputation on the site. </p>

<p>Every time an employee leaves you will loose a experience and skill that will make it harder to maintain the reputation long term.</p>

Number of employees has extremely little to do with potential to achieve anything.  So the honest answer is nothing, especially with the way you formed the question.

You should have as few employees as possible, but each must be as amazing as possible, and together it must be a well-balanced unit of skill and experience and inventiveness.

Also, you need a viable business which you are trying to create.  Without that, a team is not of much use :)
