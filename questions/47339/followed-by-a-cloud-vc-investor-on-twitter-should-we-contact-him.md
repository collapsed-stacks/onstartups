We have a small but rapidly growing cloud based product which is currently free and we are about to move into the monetization stage.

In the last week we have been followed on Twitter by a tech VC investor with a passion for cloud startups. He has about 20k followers and he follows about 5k - we have less than 50 of each and most of our followers are clients hence why he has really jumped out from the rest.

Should we make contact with him as I presume he saw something he liked? If so, how should we go about it or should we just ignore it and leave it for him to contact us if he is interested?

Thanks

Are you looking for funding? If so, then sure contact him.  What have you got to lose?

If you weren't looking for funding and just got excited because a VC followed you on twitter... then probably a bad way to make the decision on needing funding or not.

He's doing his homework. Now what you post matters and more so what your clients post is more important. He's looking to see what your doing but more so what they are saying and how much traction you have or can get. 

You could reach out to him but how many people do that to him. You would seem eager. If you wait for him to reach out to you then your in a better position. It's tactics.

I've got Dave McClure following me for my startup. I was of course hell of excited as he's one of the big guys. Yet, I held off on reaching out to him. If you play the hard to get company and he's still interested then you know getting a round from him is at least going to be a little easier.
