It's basically a fashion site where subscribers get updates on sample sales, discounts, clearance sales, latest arrivals etc. The emails are given out on a weekly basis. (At least once a week) So how much should I charge?

This looks like a spam operation on the surface.  How you have this currently worded would be 0 value to legit businesses.  So if you have something in your user settings that allow them to opt into messages from partnering affiliates and that you could show that there is a conversion rate of some sort with this group then I could see value in your plan.

Whatever price you decide, you might want to offer them 2 weeks/ 30 days free to get them hooked on the great information. You might try and splitting your list into 3 different choices - Free, mid-range price and then a high-end price. That way you can hit a wider range of users - those that want free can get a small amount of updates, those that can't decide will try the middle rate and those that are competitive and want the exclusive updates will pay to get them.

How much is it worth?

How much do the competitors charge?

How much money do your customers have?

And... most importantly! ... At what price will you make the most money? (The amount of money you make is probably the number of subscribers times the amount that you charge). You probably don't know the answer to this, so you're probably going to have to test different prices and see what potential customers do.

A good way to test different prices without confusing people is to set a reasonably high starting price, and then have sales. This week only! 80% off!

Charge who? Your subscribers or the brands and stores you feature in your blasts?

If you want to charge your subscribers for that, good luck. If you haven't even thought about charging your featured sellers yet, I'd like to be the first to welcome you to the wonderful world of business.

1. How much effort and resources are you spending
2. How quality services are you providing compare to competitors
3. How efficient database are you using

based on above you can calculate your price and add your profit then total your final quote
