I was hoping to use opensource stack exchange software to create a site where people can swap their skills.  ie: if I can fix your computer and you can fix my car, we will be matched.

However, the stack exchange platform is no longer offered as white label.

Any other suggestions for a platform where people can search for people offering the skills they need, in exchange for their own skills?

If all you're looking for is "Stack Exchange"-esque software, that question's already been answered: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/2267/stack-overflow-clones  However, you'd need to perform some pretty hefty customizations on Q&A software to work with your idea.

You may want to search around a little more to validate your idea.  Found this in a couple searches: http://www.skillsbarter.com/

I think a custom built solution would work best for this. Trying to use Q&A for a different purpose would make for poor usability.
