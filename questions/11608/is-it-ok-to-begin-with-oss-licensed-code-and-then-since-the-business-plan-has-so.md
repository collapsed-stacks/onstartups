## Is it OK to begin with OSS licensed code and then since the business plan has some uniqueness rewrite it later?

My company now a sole-proprieter at this point is for many years coming up with a business plan and modifying it.  All along developers tried to do and complete the project but they could not handle change when needed. And then taking it to new companies either they balked or redid it themselves.  Still it did not get to be useable and finished!

So now working with a team that owns several companies and they are taking a free shopping cart and a licensed OSS bidding system to create the site.  I tried for 3+ years to find a company that really knew what I wanted and could understand it!  And when I "found" them either to use their software I would have had to buy several versions and put them together.    So this last team is attempting this other way to keep costs down and get the many functions and features done. They are using the updated homepage I had been working on for years now made it WEB 2.0 version. The framework was built from Scratch to allow future use, editing and expansion, etc.  But it "shows" an bidding system of this OSS licensed software and not the screenshot I want.  What I am told it they are dealing with the functioning issues first and then will design the views to my liking.  I did not sign a licensure agreement with this other company they purchased the license. But when does the site become My Site, and the Code become my company's code?  Does it have to be tried again later from scratch finishing what I tried for years to get done later? (at probably at much greater cost then)  The point is really when I want investors, etc. or to Sell the company and website what happens to the Code!  And it will not meet all the specs either. But will be much closer.

<p>and welcome to this site.</p>

<p>Ehmn, your question is very hard to understand. I guess "OSS" stands for "open source software". In this case, you will need to carefully read the license terms of those OSS pieces. If they are of the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft" rel="nofollow">copyleft</a>' type, for example they're under the GPL license, then your codebase must also be licensed under the same license (i.e. the GPL license in this example).</p>

<p>Code initially belongs to he who creates it (the developers), unless ownership (copyright) is transferred to you via a contract. You should have a contract that clearly states that you have copyright on the code, and the source code should be marked with a copyright statement in your name. Sometimes copyright is first transferred when specific goals are met, for example when you have paid in full for the development.</p>

<p>For any 3rd party code used in the project (fx OSS code, 3rd party commercial modules) you would generally not get ownership, you would just purchase an appropriate license from the original author. If you're not developing on the codebase yourself, then you may not need a license, you may be covered by the license the development team has. You'll need to examine the license terms of the 3rd party code.</p>
