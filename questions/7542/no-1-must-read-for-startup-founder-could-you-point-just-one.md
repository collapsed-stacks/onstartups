I think the biggest challenge starting up is managing your time.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357?ie=UTF8&tag=kcoconnorcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307465357">The 4-Hour Workweek</a> is one of the best resources for time management that I have ever found.  In it, you will learn to focus on the following: <br/><br/>"Is it worth doing? <br/><br/>Will it matter in the long haul?<br/><br/> What was my impact?"

For me hands down it's Guy Kawasaki's book "Reality Check". It gives an excellent, easy to digest overview of all things startup. From there you can dive into great books taking you deeper into any particular area. But this gives a great overview.

Hands down, Bo Peabody's "Lucky or Smart".  This book is rocket fuel for the serial entrepreneur. 

I loved it so much, I wrote this review.

I personally really dig Jim Collin's *Good to Great*. I think it's a really important piece (although I seldom hear people attribute that book to building startups).

Sorry got to go two answers on you. Art of the Start is good at getting you motivated and confident around an idea and E Myth is excellent in getting you focused on being a smart and effective business owner. Some of the other books are decent, but I prefer those that closer to entrpreneurship and making it happen. You should be reading Harvard Business Review & Inc magazine as well. Those are awesome real-time lessons in success and failure and will get the fire going and your brain working overtime. Good luck.

<p>Uhmn, I'm late to this party.</p>

<p>A off-beat and to some perhaps provocative choice: "<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0140257314" rel="nofollow">Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure</a>" by Jerry Kaplan. It details life on the <em>inside</em> of GO, a venture capital backed startup with huge ambitions. It has a sombre, sad tone most of the time -- GO computer went bankrupt. The book begins with the bankruptcy auction, and then goes on to detail the journey.</p>

<p>If you after reading this book still think "I want to try!", then you're truly an entrepreneur at heart.</p>

<p>And you're motivated to prep before launching, i.e. read some of the other fine books already mentioned here.</p>

I've found it to be an interesting read and quite motivating.</p>

<p>I will add to this list the book <strong><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1599712741" rel="nofollow">Go BIG or Go HOME</a></strong> by Wil Schroter, it is easy to read and I love the examples it provides.</p>

Well, there's Business and there's Bizness, with the latter being more popular, yet ultimately, glorified Op-ed pieces. If it's boring, difficult to read and doesn't inspire you to start the next 2.0 company missing a vowel, you're on the right track. 

The best Business books are textbooks. Get an old edition of Understanding Business(Nickels,McHugh,McHugh) and Accounting for Dummies. 
(Notice how I didn't use my Amazon Affiliate link...) 

That will give you a much better foundation than any one person's manifesto. It's not because it's wrong, it's just not yours.  

If I'm forced to choose a singular starting point, I'd say What Color Is Your Parachute. Yes, it's labeled a career-finder type of book, but it covers what truly matters...

Which is: 

Find out who you are, what you love, and where you ultimately want to be. That will put you light years ahead of anything else.

Ignore the startup scene altogether. 99% of the people you interact with online are lurkers on the bitch train. If they had their nose to the grindstone, they wouldn't have time to wax poetic on all things "automated income".
