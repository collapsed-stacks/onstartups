But I was quickly turned off by the site, and after about a week I stopped going to the site. The quality of the questions and answers on startups.com is terrible. I was amazed at some of the questions that were being asked and even more so that they were getting upvoted. A majority of the questions were either really amateurish, or really badly phrased and required more details to answer properly. For example two questions I still remember are: *Where can I buy books?* and *How can I beat the competition?*. I expect to see some questions like that on all sites (including answers.onstartups.com), but it says a lot about the quality of the site when most of the questions are of that caliber. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the answers was just as bad. There were a lot of answers that were getting upvotes that were completely wrong. And I'm not talking about subjective answers where I had a different opinion, I'm talking about indisputable facts that were stated incorrectly!\r\n\r\nIt appears as though startups.com has more users than answers.onstartups.com, but I'm not so sure that is really the case. There is some suspicion that [startups.com users create various accounts][1] to populate their site and vote each other up.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I haven't been to startups.com in several months, so it's totally possible that things have changed over there. But if the quality is still the same, **I think merging them with us is a big mistake, and will only bring down the quality of our site. I vote to keep them as a separate community.** \r\n\r\nThat's just my opinion/experience...others may feel differently.

Stuff that matters. \r\n- [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/): Don\u2019t live to geek, geek to live! \r\n- [The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/): Financial talk for the rest of us. \r\n\r\n##The Motto (don't forget your logo) \r\n\r\nA logo begs for it own little, short tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it: \r\n\r\n- Just do it. \r\n- Think Different. \r\n- The Uncola. \r\n- Intel inside. \r\n- Like a rock. \r\n- The king of beers. \r\n\r\n&hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&hellip; *eventually*. So let's start from the basics. **Come up with a killer elevator pitch, tagline, and/or motto!** \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

First, Moderators (and users) should point out the problems through comments on the site, so everyone benefits from the advice. Next, perhaps, a personal email message to discuss the issue followed by warnings. If it the problems continue, then a short suspension might be warranted. If the situation persists, suspension periods can be increased. Permanent suspensions and IP bans *have* happened but are exceedingly rare. "}

This site did not go through the domain naming and voting, but we still need an elevator pitch. So this is to get you started:*\r\n\r\n**We need a killer \"elevator pitch!\"**\r\n##The Elevator Pitch \r\n\r\nThis isn't as easy as it sounds. Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. **Make every... word... count.** \r\n\r\nHere are some creative examples: \r\n\r\n- [Gawker](http://gawker.com/): Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe. \r\n- [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/): The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it\u2019s unnatural. \r\n- [Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/): We obsessively cover the auto industry. \r\n- [DumbLittleMan](http://www.dumblittleman.com/): So what do we do here? Well, it\u2019s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane. \r\n- [Needcoffee.com](http://www.needcoffee.com/): We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream. Mmmm\u2026whipped cream. \r\n\r\n##Use it as a Tagline \r\n\r\nA shorter elevator pitch *can* be used as a tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples: \r\n\r\n- [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/): News for nerds. Stuff that matters. \r\n- [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/): Don\u2019t live to geek, geek to live! \r\n- [The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/): Financial talk for the rest of us. \r\n\r\n##The Motto (don't forget your logo) \r\n\r\nA logo begs for its own little, short tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it: \r\n\r\n- Just do it. \r\n- Think Different. \r\n- The Uncola. \r\n- Intel inside. \r\n- Like a rock. \r\n- The king of beers. \r\n\r\n&hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&hellip; *eventually*. So let's start from the basics. **Come up with a killer elevator pitch, tagline, and/or motto!** \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

First, Moderators (and users) should point out the problems through comments on the site, so everyone benefits from the advice. Next, perhaps, a personal email message to discuss the issue followed by warnings. If it the problems continue, then a short suspension might be warranted. If the situation persists, suspension periods can be increased. Permanent suspensions and IP bans *have* happened but are exceedingly rare. "}

I've been meaning to ask this myself.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that the \"feedback on my site/idea\" questions are doing more harm to the community than good. They provide no benefit to the community - only the poster. I think these questions are off-topic and should be closed, but since the community hasn't come to a consensus on that I've been hesitant to close them. I would like to hear what others think about this as well.   \r\n\r\nAs for the advertising type questions, there is no need for them. I consider those questions to be spam. The place to advertise your business is in your profile.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I do think it's fine to include a link to your site if it provides value to the community. It can be in a question to provide more background, so that the community can provide a better answer, or in an answer to suggest a tool that can solve a problem or a detailed blog post on a particular subject. Sometimes it's hard to tell if it's spam, but for the most part you can tell the difference. I'm a lot more accepting if the link comes from someone who actively participates on the site, than if it comes from \"Mr. 1 rep\" who answers 5 questions, all with links to his site.\r\n\r\nI like your suggestion of having a different section of the site dedicated to those type of questions, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Maybe Robert can answer that for us?"}

Each person can cast 30 up or down votes each day, so get out there and start voting.\r\n\r\nWhy is voting beneficial to this site and why should you bother:\r\n\r\n - Up-voting increases the visibility for those questions / answers that are good quality\r\n - Down-voting indicates to the community the type of questions that should not be asked  \r\n - Up-voting encourages users to ask better questions because there is a larger reward for better quality questions\r\n - Up-voting encourages users to put more effort into answers\r\n - Up-voting increases participation in the site. If you are getting positive feedback you are likely to ask and answer more questions. This also is good for new user engagement.\r\n\r\nUp-voting is a win-win situation for the community and for the asker/answerer.

Let me explain my motivation: I, as most other readers of these posts, quickly notice if the startup works in a field which I have a special interest in. In 99% of the cases it does not. So I just ignore the request, and most other readers do the same. The request is effectively noise for us. Such requests should rather be made as customized emails to people who are already interested in the field; or to blogs and communities more vertically specialized in the field in question.\r\n\r\n - While \"please review my webapp\" requests are generally unwanted, they can be made interesting if they focus on something that is universal and educational. For example \"please review my webapp and tell me basic things I should have thought of\" is unwanted. **But** \"please review my webapp's *signup form with emphasis on how to interpret this A/B testing data*\" is interesting to a wider audience and welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.feedmyapp.com/\r\n  [2]: http://www.crunchbase.com/\r\n  [3]: http://www.startuptodo.com/"}

I've been meaning to ask this myself.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that the \"feedback on my site/idea\" questions are doing more harm to the community than good. They provide very little benefit to the community. I think these questions are off-topic and should be closed, but since the community hasn't come to a consensus on that I've been hesitant to close them. I would like to hear what others think about this as well.   \r\n\r\nThat said, I do think it's fine to include a link to your site if it provides value to the community. It can be in a question to provide more background, so that the community can provide a better answer, or in an answer to suggest a tool that can solve a problem or a detailed blog post on a particular subject. Sometimes it's hard to tell if it's spam, but for the most part you can tell the difference. I'm a lot more accepting if the link comes from someone who actively participates on the site, than if it comes from \"Mr. 1 rep\" who answers 5 questions, all with links to his site.\r\n\r\nI like your suggestion of having a different section of the site dedicated to website feedback type questions, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

I think stackexchange.com has **created a problem for itself** here - for sites that are as popular as this one (I'm guessing Answers is not too many down the list after the obvious suspects, StackOverflow, ServerFault, etc), the message seems to be they don't want to destroy the current community.  However, as noted, there are sites out there in the big wide world with more users and more questions, so who's to say they (one of the other sites) can't argue to be ***the*** startup questions site on stackexchange?\r\n\r\nFor me, stackexchange seem to be (unintentionally?) setting themselves up as some sort of **governance authority** on the internet.  I can't help thinking this is unwise, given how the internet works.  Of course, there is only one Wikipedia, and that works fine, but people respect that because it is **explicitly not-for-profit** and it has established itself as the place to go for information.  Nobody minds contributing because (amongst other things) they don't feel they are helping someone else build their business.  I think the rules of the game are very different for commercial operations on the web.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be for the the founders of the different communities to get together and see **whether a single community makes more sense**.  This is certainly a possibility, but it has the potential of watering down each community's unique personality, so I'm not convinced that would be such a good thing.\r\n\r\nHaving invested quite a lot of time into Answers, I for one would be sorry to see it disappear - I think we have a **great community here** and the **quality of answers is very high**.  That's something that should be considered when looking at the stats - 5x the questions and 2x the users is meaningless if the quality is nothing like what we have here (I must confess I didn't even know about startups.com until today).\r\n\r\nI guess meanwhile we carry on as we are, **but it would be good to get some clarity about the future before too long** as uncertainty will eventually be harmful to the community."}

I am sure some of you have the same problem I have.

To this end, I wanted to propose some \u201cstandard\u201d question tags that will help organization things. Along with \u201cstandard\u201d tags, there are some additional tags that, in conjunction with \u201cstandard\u201d tags, help define what a question is. The list I propose is below:\r\n\r\n* **Sales:** Advertising, Payments, Negotiation, Subscription, Metrics, CRM, Partners, Business-Development, Conversion, Channel\r\n* **Marketing:** Product, Pricing, Promotion, Place, Launch, Product-Definition, Analysis, Branding, Inbound, Outbound, Research, Product-Management, Identity, Public-Relations, Conferences, Benefits\r\n* **Finance:** Funding, Equity, Investment, Investors, Angel, VC, Seed-Funding, Evaluations, Loan, Stock-Options, Warrants, Bootstrapped\r\n* **Accounting:** Tax, Cash-Basis, Accural-Basis, Bookkeeping, Banks, Payroll\r\n* **Operations:** Office-Space, Hosting, Phone, Location, Real-Estate, Process, Payments\r\n* **Human-Resources:** Hiring, Motivation, Employees, Resources, Inspiration, Salary, Review, Recruiting, Benefits, Incentives, Productivity, Interviews, Compensation, Stock-Options, ISO, NSO, Consultants, Intern, Career\r\n* **Development:** Project-Planning, Beta, Minimum-Viable-Product, Metrics, Open-Source, Platforms, Demo, Team, Virtual-Workforce, Bug-Tracking, User-Interface, Launch, Research, Outsourcing, Graphic-Design, Technology, Software, Website\r\n* **Legal:** Business-Structures, C-Corporation, LLC, S-Corporation, Sole-Proprietor, Partnerships, Non-Profit, License, Corporate-Structure, Insurance, NDA, Contracts, Terms-and-Conditions,Patents, Trademarks, Copyright, Trade-Secrets, License,  Intellectual-Property\r\n* **Customer:** Support, Trial, User-Interface, Social-Network, Service, Metrics\r\n* **Management:** Board-of-Directors, Exit-Strategy, Pitch, Co-Founder, Leadership, Advisors, Incubators, Risk, Business-Plan, Founders, Planning\r\n* **Business-Model:** SaaS, PaaS, B2B, B2C, Desktop, Channel, Direct, eCommerce, Enterprise, Consumer, Service, Subscription, Partner\r\n* **Meta:** Advice, Recommendations, Ideas, Startup, Startups, Software, Hardware, Mentor, Tags\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to have less than 15 \u201cstandard\u201d tags or categories and the rest would be additional details for a question. For example, a question about how to price for the SaaS market might have the tags: **Marketing, Pricing, Business-Model SaaS**. Of course, you can still put any old tag you may want as well.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I community wikied this so feel free to hack away or leave a comment.\r\n"}

By upvoting (or downvoting) a new user's question:\r\n\r\n 1. You are helping them get the most out if the site, and as a result they will be more likely to become more active. If you upvote a good question, you are showing them that these are the types of questions that are beneficial to the community as a whole. You are also telling them that the level of detail provided in the question is good. In the same way, by downvoting a question, you are helping the new user understand that either the way the question was asked needs improvement, or that the question is simply off-topic for this site. Of course this can only occur if the downvoter leaves a comment. Basically, it encourages the asking of good questions.\r\n 2. You help increase their rep to the point that they can get more out of the site, and as a result will be more likely to become active. Simply asking and answering questions may not be as exciting to some people. For example, if a new user asks a good question, and gets upvoted enough times to reach 15 rep, they can then upvote those answers that were helpful to him/her. Which in turn encourages the answerers.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are a few badges you can earn from upvoted questions, which again can stimulate more participation on the site.\r\n\r\nI agree that this site tends to have a low vote count when compared to other SE sites. I'm not sure why that is though. It could be that we get a lot of one time visitors. It's hard to change the behavior if we don't really know what is causing it. Any suggestions would be helpful.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I can tell you that I try to vote as much as I can. I will usually upvote a question I've answered, unless I think it is an **extremely** basic question. For example something like *\"What is an LLC?\"*, but those types of questions are not very common here. Also, sometimes I get so carried away answering a question that I forget to upvote it. In those cases, I will end up upvoting it later on when I realize that I forgot to upvote it. "}

It also ascribes a big negative to a lot of helpful people.\r\n\r\n*Is there an alternative conclusion to draw?*\r\n\r\nSure. Plenty. Maybe many questions don't merit upvoting? Maybe the purpose of upvoting isn't clear or similarly understood by everyone? Maybe there are bigger implications with upvoting the wrong answer here than, say, the hombrew site, and so people shy from dropping it like it was candy?\r\n\r\n*How can we fix this tendency?*\r\n\r\nI come here to answer questions or seek advice. It's one of the better places I've come across because it emphasizes a Q&A mindset, rather than subjective discussion. To me, the points are incidental, not the main thing. Plus, the more active you are, the more you give and gather over time. What's the rush?\r\n\r\nI downvote things that I know are incorrect. I upvote questions that are novel, unique, remarkable. Like Zuly, I also get carried away and forget to upvote.\r\n\r\nHowever, IMO upvoting is not the equivalent of FB's \"Like\". It's not something to throw about like a popularity contest. People base their startup decisions on some of what is written here.\r\n\r\n"}

I believe *lawyers would still add this to their posts*, either because of professional requirements or just out of old habit.\r\n\r\nAnother question is perhaps whether we would benefit from having a site-wide general disclaimer in place. I mean, *to protect those who provide answers*, and for all answers given, regardless of whether the answer is about legal issues or not. Something like \"All answers are WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED; AND ANSWERS.ONSTARTUPS.COM AND CONTENT CONTRIBUTORS ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR DIRECT OR INDIRECT CONSEQUENCES FROM FOLLOWING ADVICE GIVEN ...\" etc. (Obviously, using a real legal text written by a lawyer.)\r\n\r\nI'm a Danish citizen, and I'm not worried about getting sued over advice given here in my country. But perhaps some of the US contributors, especially those with some money in the bank, would like it. I did a quick read through on the legal disclaimer on this site, and it does have a warranty disclaimer in section 5.

For example, if someone asks, \u201cI set up a web server at home but I can\u2019t access it from work,\u201d it\u2019s OK to rewrite the question as, \u201cWhat things should I check when a web server running at home is not visible on the Internet?\u201d In fact, sometimes selfish, stupid questions of the \u201cdo my homework\u201d variety can be easily edited into a form where the answer will provide an extremely valuable resource for the internet at large\r\n\r\nAlso, I would note that \"teach me how to fish\" is sort of the point here, e.g. don't tell me how to find cheap office space in New York City, but teach me what I need to know to make a smart deal on office space (almost) anywhere in the world."}

There's only so many times that question can be asked, and it gets asked over and over again on all of the stack exchange sites.\r\n\r\n - (note the closed ones here) http://quant.stackexchange.com/search?tab=relevance&q=books\r\n - http://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/89/book-for-beginners\r\n - (note the difference in the questions here) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/books\r\n\r\nIt's a poll type question where there really isn't an 'answer' just a list of books that you can vote on.  It's not really the type of question that would attract great people to the site while it is still in beta.\r\n\r\nJoel [writes about it here][1]:\r\n\r\n> It's tempting to start with easy\r\n> questions, like \"what are some good\r\n> finance books\" or \"what are the best\r\n> finance blogs.\"\r\n> \r\n> Those are not good questions for the\r\n> private beta, because ultimately, they\r\n> don't reflect the actual content that\r\n> we want this site to contain, and are\r\n> not representative of it.\r\n\r\nThis site is in public beta, so I guess you could argue that this question was different than the other books question and so it should be allowed.  If so, just vote to reopen. I won't close it twice.  My opinion is there has been a gradual decline in the quality of this site since Jason and Dharmesh don't actively participate as much and I'm trying to head that off.  The newer questions tend to be poorly worded, hard to understand, focused on discussion rather than objective answers or advice, and I don't want those broken windows to define the future of this site.\r\n\r\nRegarding your questions on the 'close' feature: The reason a single user can close a question is because moderators can close questions with one vote.  The question can be reopened but either a mod would have to reopen it or five users from the community with enough rep would have to vote to have it reopen.  It's not a new feature. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.quant.stackexchange.com/questions/4/please-avoid-surveys-polls-subjective-questions-and-very-broad-questions-durin"}

See [this post][1] from their blog. The new format now shows most rep for the week by default, but there are other tabs. I'm not sure how they are calculating this information, but it looks to be wrong (at least on our site). For example, right now Jesper is the number one user in the weekly view with 110 rep, but if you click on the monthly view, the number one user only has 105 rep for the month, and Jesper is not on the first page at all. How can that be?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't like the new user page design. I find it harder to read that the old design. I think some of the changes they made only make sense for SO because they have a ton of users and questions. For example, displaying the tags each user has been most active for. I can't imagine this will be of much use to any SE site, other than SO.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, your rep might have changed recently as well. They recently [recalculated everyone's rep][2] in preparation for the new /user pages. They claim the rep re-calc was necessary to even everyone out, but I have yet to find any logic in their argument for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-users-page/\r\n  [2]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/80862/sudden-sharp-reputation-drop-problem-points-disappeared-and-score-lost-recalc"}

I changed it to \"How do I raise a second round of VC when our first round VC passes\".  Related, but not the intent of the original asker.  The problem is the original asker's question stunk, horribly.  The question I turned it into, could actually be interesting.  I don't really know how the original asker feels, but I hope that \r\n\r\n - he/she understands that the new question is a better question than the original one\r\n - he/she understands that if they don't want their question edited, they don't grok the point of SE\r\n - I don't give a hoot what their question actually turned into, just that it was a good relevant question for this site that makes people want to come back\r\n\r\nFor one of these questions, the [user got upset with me][1] for 'hijacking their words'.\r\n\r\nThe original question looked like so:\r\n\r\n> **Million Dollar Homepage success reason** \r\n\r\n> What do you think about the\r\n> success of\r\n> http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/?\r\n> \r\n> Why did it became a quick hit?

I am new to the site. I have been around for -- about a day. \r\n\r\nI like the structure. the format. And I have enjoyed the opportunity to answer some questions with some expertise that I have built up over the years. I am sure there are lots of conversations on here about how to build the site, but I would like to address this specific question -- \r\n\r\n**Quality of Questions.**\r\n\r\nSome are good. Some suck. Some are inviting. Some not so much. What is the most important is are there filters that allow me to find the good ones fast? There might be -- I haven't figured out how to use them yet. Are they the ones with the most votes? Most active? \r\n\r\nAre there featured questions which be reflect and model the type of questions that seem to spark the best conversation? The only featured one I have seen on the list is one that \"bought\" its way there with reputation points -- and I am having a hard time seeing it as a great example of the type of question the community would want to feature. \r\n\r\nI haven't posted a question yet. I know I should. I know it would help. I started writing one. I left the screen before it was completed. Why? I didn't feel like I knew enough to write a good question for this site. I haven't seen enough good ones yet.\r\n\r\nI see that badges are given for the  people who post outstanding questions -- perhaps there would be an easy way I could go and see the people who have earned those badges and the questions that was so exemplary? \r\n\r\nPerhaps after I have been on the site with a certain level of activity a \"community leader\" will reach out and say hello, we enjoyed your answers -- how can I help you ask a question?\"\r\n\r\nBack when I did community development -- a couple professions ago -- we had a game to teach community called \"Shake your assets.\" It was about how a complex system like a community needs people to ask as much as give. The act of giving is often seen as a gift to someone in need. But asking is a gift to some one who has a talent or resource to give. For a community to be healthy there must be a balance for those who ask and those who give. \r\n\r\n*So, in summary:*\r\n\r\n - Make it easier for us to find good\r\n   questions \r\n - Profile and Feature great\r\n   questions \r\n - Allow me to learn from best\r\n - Make it a goal of the community to solicit questions from all community members. \r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to learning more from all of you! \r\n   practices on good questions"}

A singe downvote can happen for lots of reasons; fx someone speed-reads and misunderstands the post, or the post genuinely isn't a good fit for this site but the downvoter doesn't have time to add a more helpful comment, etc. A single upvote brings +10 reputation points, so upvotes are much stronger than downvotes.\r\n\r\nZuly Gonzales notes that undeserving downvotes are often [countered by one or many \"sympathy upvotes\"][1], so the net effect ends up being positive for the poster.\r\n\r\nJeff Atwood blogged about the rationale for the design decision to have downvotes here:\r\nhttp://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/the-value-of-downvoting-or-how-hacker-news-gets-it-wrong/\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/201/effects-of-down-voting-your-competition/205#205"}

When I flag it and make a comment or a reason why -- I want the user to be able to see why. When someone flags me -- now I am at the reputation level to see why -- but before I couldn't -- and that is when I needed to know and learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reasons**\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons I believe that this would be a valuable addition: \r\n\r\n - Direct feedback promotes learning: the more explicit and precise the feedback, the stronger it is as a learning tool. We don't want new users who have questions edited to get frustrated and leave -- we want them to say \"wow, this group wants me to be successful\" -- having personal feedback will promote a positive learning environment.\r\n\r\n - *Transparency promotes accountability*: If I know that I will be personally connected with the edit and the comment there will be increased diligence on \"getting it right\" If the person who has been flagged, or edited knows that the person is a real person there the likelihood of them having a negative experience goes down. And it can become a learning, growing moment.\r\n\r\n - *Communication builds community*: Facilitating and supporting communication between real people rather than just reputation numbers, up click and down click facilitates the development of a stronger community. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing feedback on this feature request, and hopefully a positive response from the powers-at-be.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://answers.onstartups.com/q/23782/8791"}

Who are the primary users of this site? Can you give a little more description of what you consider \"quality\" users?\r\n\r\nMy first gut reaction was guerrilla marketing. Go after the top similar type forums and post questions as well as answers for visibility. So for example, Linkedin Answers or Yahoo Answers. Answer startup related questions related to some of the best posts here and end with a simple signature/link at the end and little plug that \"From our Answers Users\" or something like that. Each forum (like Linkedin Answers) has lots of crazy active, crazy smart people who contribute and lots of people who look. Go after the big ones. Some may chop your posts but do it in a mostly neutral way and give it a go.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, post really interesting questions that start off with a lot of valuable content that you're giving to that particular community with a request for more answers from the users. Like I did with my \"productivity\" post - I had about 10 things I do then asked others to jump in. And again, you brand this as \"Answers\" driven. Soft sell.\r\n\r\nAnd per your question, you could create some type of incentive to get people to check the site out. That might get you blasted off but you can test the waters and try.\r\n\r\nThat's just one idea. I know it takes a lot of time but it's cheap and I think it's going to hit a highly qualified audience.\r\n\r\nI'll search the brain for some more ideas.\r\n\r\nBest of luck."}

There are a ton of other businesses that can benefit from this forum. Most of the questions and answers apply to any business. Look at places like Startup Nation or the like.\r\n - **Organize Resource Pages:** Take all the great questions and answers and put together a common startup guide or something like that.

Here are a few of mine:\r\n\r\nBadges/Buttons-The badges here are used internally to this site (which is fine) but you could implement a public badge creator that enables people to embed an OnStartups Answers badge/button on their blog or website that links to this site. This would be similar to the many <a href=\"http://www.twitterbuttons.com/twitter-badges.html\">Twitter button creators</a>, etc.\r\n\r\nEmail Newsletter- Although many people use RSS feeds, some people prefer to subscribe to forums via email and receive a weekly or monthly round-up of top questions and answers. This is a great way for people to opt-in to receive information (even if they don't register with the Answers site), and emails are often forwarded to others. To increase email subscriptions, or just offer on its own without registration form if you want to take a more viral approach, offer a relevant, useful eBook, video, or other type of content that they immediately receive. This content should be optimized to be shared via social media, furthering its reach.\r\n\r\nVideo Campaign- Create a series (start with one video, test it, analyze results, create second video, and so on) of short videos and post to YouTube and the OnStartups blog. Include a strong call-to-action, for example the \"Google inbound marketing\" CTA that HubSpot used in <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/4437/You-Oughta-Know-Inbound-Marketing.aspx\">You Oughta Know Inbound Marketing\"</a> video.\r\n\r\nSEO Press Release-Simple, short press release announcing two successful software entrepreneurs started free community to help other startups. Do some keyword research and be sure to include keywords in release and provide link to Answers site. <a href=\"http://www.prlog.com\">PRLog</a> is my preferred free or low-cost release distribution site.\r\n\r\nContest- The person that submits a question that gets the most community votes during a specific month, and the person that has the top answer during that specific month, each receive a free 1 hour conference call with you and Dharmesh to receive valuable advice on their most challenging problems. Since only active community users with high enough internal badges can vote, this would prevent cheating."}

The quality of questions looks on average poor : a lot of questions are somehow off-topic, or subjective, or very low level (the kind of questions that can be answered by the first link you find by googling the question).\r\n 2. Nobody (or almost nobody) is voting. There are only a few upvotes and no downvotes. How can we converge to a high quality Q&A sites without any real long-term involvment : people are asking 1 question and never come back. It looks that people interested in the site do not vote systematically for good questions and answers... This makes difficult for newcomers to understand what is a good (or bad) question for the site.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the high number of questions without votes (or with 1 or 2 at max) is suspect to me.\r\nAlso, it looks like there is no moderation : off-topic questions are still open, untagged questions are still untagged, etc.\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstood what I am saying here : I am just giving my concerns, maybe I did not get what this Q&A site is about."}

Thank you for your questions and answers. Thank you for your voting. I have enjoyed watching your engagement over the last 10 days.\r\n\r\nI am also new -- about 40-ish days or something -- I would have to go check to be exact. I thing that your analysis is spot on:\r\n\r\n1. Questions are of generally poor quality. \r\n2. There is very low engagement of voting\r\n3. There is poor initial engagement of new members -- and the UI is very difficult for new members\r\n4. There is relatively low level of engagement from moderators. (there are some exceptions, see my comments below)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Things to Consider**\r\n\r\n - Based on my \"look\" at the other sites and a quick comparison -- the percentage of voting/views is about the same as on the other sites. The number of views on this site is simply significantly lower. This is not because of a lower number of registered users -- but a lower percetange of active users that are viewing the questions. \r\n - There are relatively few active users with moderation privileged. There are two type -- the chosen moderators, and those that have earned limited moderating privileged. Of those that are active-- I have found them to be very diligent on the issues that you mention like closing off-topic questions. (The lack of transparency around these processes do make that engagement difficult to assess) I have also found that they (we) are sensitive to not \"shutting down\" new members for slightly off topic questions in order to encourage them to improve and remain engaged with the site. (For example [this][1] one that you questioned this morning that lots of people really enjoyed.) One of the challenges is that most of the theresholds (for \"closing\" for example) by moderators with earned privileges have been set up system-wide and do not seem to be indexed according to the specific site activity. \r\n - There is very poor community member retention. While there is/was an extenuating circumstance (see below) the poor level of participation by the moderators and reputation leaders in the site, as well as the sharp drop off after a certin point of these folks seems to have had a significant negative impact on the sites ability to mature. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Extenuating Circumstances**\r\n\r\nI am sure you see lots of \"answers\" to questions on this \"meta\" site referencing both the beta nature of the site, as well as the fact that it is a transfer from another site model which was determined not to work. This answer is used as an explanation to the general poor level of development of the community. \r\n\r\nIt also seems to me to be an excuse. The site is a beta. It is migrated from another model. And all of the issues you identified are still true and still should be proactively addressed. \r\n\r\n\r\n**My Experience**\r\n\r\nI have found that -- in contrast to other online communities of which I am part -- the challenge of OnStartups (perhaps the Stack's model) are:\r\n\r\n - Lack of transparency by the \"owners/leaders\" of the site \r\n - Lack of delegation of responsibilities \r\n - Lack of direct member-member communications\r\n - Lack of discernible plan to build or grow the community  \r\n\r\n**So what's the answer?**\r\n\r\nThe general precept of the site is that it is a member driven community. (Whether or not it really is an authentically member driven site is a separate discussion I suppose) **Within that context the responsibility to make it what we want or hope it could/should/would be rests with us**. As individuals. Taking the baby steps needed. \r\n\r\nThe best way to improve the quality of questions -- is to ask high quality questions. i see that you have asked a great question about selling investors. It did not get any answers or votes. My experience is that folks like questions that are very specific rather than general. I bet if you were to have asked that question to be very specific to a situation you were facing right now there would have been lots of answers and votes. (Well, its for this site-- which will be between 5-7 votes!)\r\n\r\nThe best way to increase voting -- is to increase your number of votes. Go back to old questions and answers and find ones that you like. I see that you have been active voting in your first ten days (an average of 4.5 or so a day is more than the average bear) If more of us do this the positive feedback will encourage more involvement. We can increase the level of discernment on \"quality\" as the activity improves. If you \"write off\" questions with only 1-2 votes as being suspect with acknowledgement of the low voting, then you might be missing some great questions that your experience could add a great answer. Even if it is an old question, your answer will move it back into the active list and reintroduce it to people who might have missed it.\r\n\r\nI have tried to reach out directly to lots of members. following up with their questions. Offering to review marketing decks or read executive summaries. I have become friends with several site members and am learning much from their experience. It is unfortunate that the site does not encourage or really support that level of community building. But for folks that do fill out their profile to include a site, that has a link for emailing/im-ing or the like -- it is possible to reach out. \r\n\r\nI am still trying to figure out how to engage the site members in the development of a real plan which would include delegation of responsibilities, proactively engage new members, reach out to targeted folks that we want to join us -- and all of the other great things that should/could be done. \r\n\r\n*Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.* \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://answers.onstartups.com/q/24295/8791"}

To summarize what they all say:\r\n\r\n - An unjustified downvote from one individual usually results in up votes which offset\r\nA pattern by an individual to downvoting is watched and \"moderated\"\r\n - Different members of the community will interpret the FAQ different. The benefit of the community is it takes more than one person to close or delete a question.\r\n - A growing number of community members are adding direct comments when they down vote to increase the transparency and positive feedback.\r\n - A downvote might feel bad.

(Which you just commented on with a question which I will go and answer there.) \r\n\r\nThree thoughts that further address your issue:\r\n\r\n - The site needs more voting, to lesson the impact of an individual vote -- so go vote. Make it a goal to \"use up\" all your allocated votes in a single day at least once a week. If you need to lower your standard for the next couple months on what makes a great question or answer -- do it, because positive feedback will do far more to generate positive community activity then no feedback. \r\n - Give positive feedback and upvotes to the community members that take the time to explain downvotes -- and to those who provide constructive feedback to new members on how to improve their questions/answers. \r\n - Increase transparence between members. One way to do this is go vote for my [feature request][2]. Voting for a feature requests send the message to the site operators that it is something we want. Very few members have viewed my feature request -- and hardly anyone has comment or voted. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/q/366/8791\r\n  [2]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/q/412/8791"}

If all they are doing is shameless self-promotion (as opposed to [incidental self-promotion][1] which should not be treated so harshly), I say go ahead and scare them away. Almost everything else though is an opportunity for teaching someone what we are looking for. I suspect most questions that get downvoted could instead be fixed with some coaching or collaborative editing. The [ability to have a private conversation][2] would really help here.\r\n\r\nFinally, anonymous downvoting is counterproductive and cowardly. If you can't make a case for your downvote, you should not be allowed to do it. If you are afraid of getting a \"reputation\" for downvoting, you should not be allowed to do it. If you do not have your profile filled out, you should not be allowed to do it. This is not some kind of repressive regime where there will be deadly retribution for exercising free speech.

I would NEVER encourage anyone to be mean about it, but the occasional down-vote is the only way to let people know that any old mediocre, half-assed answer is going to get pushed down the list while the better, more \"expert\" answers will rise to the top.

That we will demonstrate to new community members the incredible value of the collective wisdom of the community.

I think this might work well with a promotional idea I've been toying with for some time now - starting a blog for the site. \r\n\r\nA couple of other SE sites have blogs of their own. For example, the [Gaming Blog][1] and the [Super User Blog][2] (not sure which others have site specific blogs). So I thought maybe we could start our own blog to promote the site and increase traffic. The \"Stump the Chumps\" follow-up segments would make great content for our blog. \r\n\r\nWays we could implement this are:\r\n\r\n - **Video:** We could interview the users we helped via short video segments. This makes for a more personal touch. \r\n - **Article:** We could do a regular text interview blog post, where we would email several questions to the user we helped, and post it in a Q&A format. \r\n - **Guest posts:** Ask some of the users we've helped if they would like to write a guest post describing how the information we provided them helped them in their startup.\r\n\r\nSome of the problems I see with this approach:\r\n\r\n - **Dharmesh hosts his own blog on [onstartups.com][3].** We need to somehow make it clear that these are two separate blogs.\r\n - **Finding people to write content.** With the current lack of community participation I'm doubtful we will have enough people volunteering to write posts to make the blog a success. And unfortunately, I don't have enough free time to be the sole contributor (I can't even keep up with my own blog).\r\n - **Contacting users.** This doesn't solve the privacy issue, as we somehow still need to contact community members to ask if they would be willing to share their story. This is probably the biggest obstacle. One way around this is to setup a meta question asking for volunteers - people who have used the information they found on the site to positively impact their startup.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://gaming.blogoverflow.com/\r\n  [2]: http://blog.superuser.com/\r\n  [3]: http://onstartups.com/"}

There is no incentive/reason for them to come here - and again, when they do land here there is not much to keep them.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong - there are plenty of great people using the site - I just don't think we're anywhere near a critical mass of regularly visiting \"experts\".

Therefore how we apply this technology must take that fact into consideration when we moderate the content.\r\n\r\nWhile we honor the Stack Overflow roots of Stack Exchange, there has got to be some flexibility here or this thing is just going to die. Even with programming questions at Stack Overflow there can be more than one correct answer. Sometimes the \"best\" answer is not the answer that is most helpful in a reader's particular circumstances. There are lots of questions with several highly informative answers.

The trouble with a question like [yours](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/26132/what-order-should-these-10-startup-steps-be) is that the answer is too multifaceted. In other words, to be utterly literal minded, by asking what order those ten steps should be in, well, there are 10! (ten factorial) possible orders, which is 10 * 8 * ... * 1 = 3,628,800 -- so essentially you've created a discussion with infinite permutations and it's hard to \"rate\" good answers and the model here doesn't work so well. So you'll get one person answering \"What does having a life plan matter\"? And another person talking about whether you need a business plan--that's just conversation, it's not Q&A.\r\n\r\nFar more useful and appropriate to *this particular site* might be to break it down into individual questions, where, even though the answer might be subjective, at least has some focus. For example:\r\n\r\n* Do you need a life plan to start a business?\r\n* How soon should you create a business plan?\r\n\r\nEtc. There the answers can really be judged as \"helpful\" or \"unhelpful.\"\r\n\r\n**One more important guideline** - Stack Exchange works really well when people are asking questions about problems that *they are actually having.* Otherwise it's just an exercise in creative chit-chat.

Otherwise it's just an\r\n> exercise in creative chit-chat.\r\n\r\nI have no reason to disagree with that assertation. Obviously not all questions are problem based but the point is well taken. Additionally it is sometimes fool hearty to assume that questions that seem highly specualtive are not actually addressing specific issues and experiences the asker is having. But that being said, this response provokes the following question for me.\r\n\r\nHow would we know \"works really well\" on this Stack Exchange board? **What are the indicators of success?** \r\n\r\nAre the best questions the ones with the most views? The most up votes?  Are these the ones that are a model that should be emulated? \r\n\r\nAre the best answers the ones with the most views? The most up votes? Are these the ones that are a model that should be emulated? \r\n\r\nIs \"works well\" in the eyes of the owners, the moderators -- or the person who asked the question? If the asker never selected an \"approved\" answer is that a reflection that the board did not work well for them? \r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/q/519/8791"}

Stack Exchange has the ability to pull the low quality threads from the database for us, so we won't have to manually find these low quality posts. We will, however, have to manually go through the threads we get back from Stack Exchange to decide what we want to do with each thread.\r\n\r\n**Step 1**\r\n\r\nThe first step in this process is to come up with a list of criteria we believe are indicators of a thread that needs attention. Once we have this list, we can pass it along to the Stack Exchange team and they will query the database for us. This will result in a list of threads that meet the criteria we have identified. We will then go through those threads to remove the off-topic and low quality content.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have the list of criteria finalized by the end of this week, if possible. **My question is, what are indicators of a post that may need our attention?** What criteria do we want to pass along to the Stack Exchange team?\r\n\r\nHere is what I've come up with so far:\r\n\r\n - Questions with close votes\r\n - Questions and answers with a score of -2 or less\r\n - Questions tagged [tag:feedback]\r\n - Questions tagged [tag:ask-onstartups]\r\n - Questions that have earned the [Tumbleweed badge][2]\r\n - [Unanswered questions][3] (including those with [0 answers][4])\r\n - Questions that have been closed\r\n - Users who have not visited the site in over 8 months (or some other timeframe), and have only posted once\r\n\r\n**What else should we add to this list?**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAlso, please take a look at @Joseph's related question, on [what to do with the feedback tag.][5]\r\n\r\nLastly, I created a [cleanup chat room][6] to discuss this effort in more detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/526/onstartups-clean-up-getting-started\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/badges/21/tumbleweed\r\n  [3]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=newest\r\n  [4]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers\r\n  [5]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/530/is-there-a-legitimate-use-of-the-feedback-tag-on-the-main-board\r\n  [6]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/552/onstartups-cleanup"}

What throws us off course here is that \"general business\" is brought up, so it looks like a distinction done on startup versus general business. IMHO that isn't really the thing to focus on.\r\n\r\nThe critical part is a distinction between topics which are:\r\n\r\n - *uniquely related to startups -- business plans, VC financing, product/market fit* for example \r\n - **versus**\r\n - topics which concern a common technology or business process *which just happens to be used by a startup*.\r\n\r\n**The problem is** that if you consider anything a startup happens to *make use of* on-topic, then in extremity **everything** is on-topic for this site. How to write HTML (for your startup website), which car to buy (for your first company car) and so forth. And thus the site will become unfocused and meaningless, a kind of discuss-everything-free-for-all like Slashdot or (shudder) Yahoo! Answers.\r\n\r\nThe above distinction is rarely a clear-cut one or the other decision, it's a judgement call.\r\n\r\nI can remember how I first thought of this, but not find the conversation from back then (I think it was before we got a separate Meta site). The **question was which hotel he should choose.** My comment was that this was off-topic, he should go to Hotels.com or similar. He replied that he needed the hotel *because he was in town to pitch investors*; and so the question was *clearly startup related*. IMHO this is a good illustration of the slippery slope this line of thinking can lead to, and that some moderation is required."}

This is a Q&A site, and those questions do not fit this site's format. Those questions are designed to elicit opinions and discussions, not to find the right answer. I know we have a lot of subjective questions on this site, and that's fine with me, because that's the nature of the startups topic. However, I feel like the \"review my ...\" questions go way beyond simply being subjective, and can only be strictly discussion questions.\r\n 2. These questions lead to lots of spam. I'm sure there are plenty of folks out there that are truly interested in getting feedback on how to improve their product/website/etc (I'm one of them). The problem is that there are probably way more people out there that are simply interested in posting a link to their site to get traffic, and never plan on contributing to the site. I consider this to be spam, and it is very annoying to those of us that put so much effort into building this site.\r\n 3. If we ignore the above two points, and decide to allow these questions, my feeling is that we'll end up getting overrun with them. That's all we'll end up seeing on the main page, and as a result we'll end up pushing away the few experts left on this site. These types of questions are generally not interesting, and for the most part only benefit the person asking the question. Plus very few of us actually have the time it takes to review someone's website, or product, or whatever.\r\n\r\nI do see this as a genuine need for a lot of folks, but unfortunately I don't think we're the site to meet that need. I suggest we keep this question in mind, [Where can I get feedback or have my site reviewed?][2], and update it any time we discover a new review site.\r\n\r\n**My vote is that these questions remain as off-topic.**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/41/what-to-do-with-feedback-on-my-site-type-questions/\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/16543/where-can-i-get-feedback-or-have-my-site-reviewed"}

Although this is a \"startups\" Q&A site, not all questions have to be directly tied to startups.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I've since come to believe that these tags were created without any thought being given to them. I don't think there was an intended purpose for them."}

You're a gem, really.\r\n\r\nAbout what to do ... honestly, I don't know, and I despair at it.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I feel that Answers.Onstartups (AO) is drowning in low-quality questions. And my motivation to contribute answers is falling, hard.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is easily Google-able questions, but that's not the only problem. There is at least one important problem more: The Stack Exchange (SE) engine was built to avoid duplicates of the same question. But it was built on programming questions, which often have a narrow vocabulary; a specific set of words are set by the professional vernacular.\r\n\r\nAO deals with 'business' issues and 'human' issues, and the list of more-or-less synonym words that can be used is huge. We're seeing lots of fairly similar questions being asked again and again, and the SE engine isn't successfully stopping this. (To be fair, 'reading the users mind' is the very hardest problem there is in computer science!) (And before someone reminds me of the Close -> Exact Duplicate function, I just used it a few seconds ago.)\r\n\r\n**Back to easily Google-able questions:** Actually my first instinct is to go easy on them. They can work as Google-fodder, providing link bait which lures in other prospective entrepreneurs and helps grow this site.\r\n\r\nBut, this should be handled in context of how the site is currently doing. My personal view is that while many things are steadily improving, we are currently loosing a vital battle over the signal-to-noise ratio. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old-timer, but that's how I feel.\r\n\r\nSo, while I think that easily Google-able questions are essentially an asset, I would be all in favor of going hash on them until the community moderation is stronger. My main focus is that I'd like a stronger community moderation here."}

After listening to all the stories about startups, I get the sense that if you want to launch a successful startup, you MUST dedicate all your time and energy to it.\r\n\r\nI started a web hosting company over 10 years ago and it was very successful. I paid for everything from my own pocket. No funding of any kind, not even borrowing or taking a loan. I started with a single server and kept adding more hardware with more traffic, organically. I have no employees and I didn't pay myself. I had a day job. The web hosting was a one man shop and I did EVERYTHING; hardware and software support, billing and marketing. ALL THIS WHILE KEEPING MY DAY JOB! Yes it was hard work and nerve wrecking when a server would go down. I was nervous and tense whenever I traveled because I was in a \"what will I do if a server goes down or I need to be there to replace some hardware\" mode.\r\nI built the systems myself. My ISP has no idea and all they can do is push the reset or power buttons. \r\n\r\nHowever I gave great customer support. I would answer business calls during work, secretly.. oops! Business mail would forward to my phone. That's the only way to juggle between a day job and have a side business AND offer fast customer support. But it worked for YEARS and minus the hosting fee I paid my ISP, almost all my revenue was pure profit. It was nice, minus some stress.\r\n\r\nThen, I got married and had kids and got very busy. It affected my business. I was giving it less time and my customers felt it and they started moving to other hosting companies and I neglected all kinds of marketing so eventually I was bleeding customers. Customers left with no new customers signing up. I decided my family came first. The only time I could do any work was when everyone went to bed and I would stay up, coding and coding.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the web is that if you go to a web site offering a service, you have no idea if one person is behind it or a group of people. I used that to my advantage. As long as your web site looks professional and you offer a reliable affordable useful service, **you are in business!**.\r\n\r\nI understand that a lot of people are afraid to start a startup and to quit their day job. They don't want to lose the security of a dependable salary and the benefits like health insurance. If you have kids and a mortgage, it would be frightening to lose all that. Some take the leap and some people don't. I didn't. BUT what if you can just make both happen? A secure day job AND and a profitable online business.\r\n\r\nMy web hosting is dying now. That's OK and I understand. The business became a commodity and there are tons of companies offering free hosting, 59 cents hosting and other crazy figures. I can probably do the same and still be profitable but I think I had enough and I need a change.\r\n\r\nGuess what? I am still planning to keep my day job and I have THREE ideas for startups. I am very excited about them and each one can keep me busy for YEARS. I am on fire and I am full of energy to work on the first one. Because I am a web developer, I can build them myself. I can host them myself because I already have hosting experience. I know developing them myself might be too much for me so maybe I will outsource some work using services like rentacoder.com or eLance.com and be in charge because they are my ideas, I know how they should be built and I have the specs.\r\n\r\nIf an idea fails as a business, that's OK too. Because it will be a great learning experience from a technical side for me. I am a Windows developer. I want to learn WPF, Silverlight, MVC, .NET 4.0, WCF, JQuery.. and the rest of the latest coming out from the technical firehose. What's better than learning these cutting edge technologies, be proficient in them and build a concrete application that the whole world will use. You can put these in your resume and be more marketable. Remember.. I have a day job and want to be more marketable and earn more because I have practical modern skills.\r\n\r\nSo here's my final word, which I mentioned in the beginning, if you want to keep your job and work on a side online business, go for it. I did it and I am planning to do it again.. and again. If you are going to do it yourself, it will take A LOT of work. To make it happen faster, you will need to focus, have a cutting sharp concentration, adaptable, resourceful, flexible, manage your time with a determination, be able to cut the noise from the web (tweets, facebook, blogs, emails.. etc). Learn.. learn.. learn. I read a lot every day just trying to keep up with all the new technologies. When I code and I need help, I Google. if it looks like it will take me more than 5-10 minutes (I do my homework) to find an answer, I post a question on stackoverflow.com. SO is a great resource.

If I work for a company in a full-time job, I believe it is right to give my all.  During work time, that means I need to be **100% focused on the task in hand**, so that calls into question whether it is right to be taking support calls from your side business.  Also, as an employer, I take on smart people because of what they can as a **whole person** can contribute (for example, some of my best ideas have been in the shower), so I would feel slightly cheated if I found out their primary energy and intellect was going into somebody else's business.  (Please note I am not saying staff should work 24/7).\r\n\r\nMy point is not that what Tony is saying is wrong, but rather that it isn't universally true, and that people should be careful before jumping on the \"business in my spare time\" bandwagon.  As a transition strategy, I'm sure it has been useful for many start-ups, but I disagree it's a long-term proposition for too many people."}

There is no correct answer. You're asking people to do too much with one question.\r\n\r\n* They can be spam.

I was amazed at some of the questions that were being asked and even more so that they were getting upvoted. A majority of the questions were either really amateurish, or really badly phrased and required more details to answer properly. For example two questions I still remember are: *Where can I buy books?* and *How can I beat the competition?*. I expect to see some questions like that on all sites (including answers.onstartups.com), but it says a lot about the quality of the site when most of the questions are of that caliber. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the answers was just as bad. There were a lot of answers that were getting upvotes that were completely wrong. And I'm not talking about subjective answers where I had a different opinion, I'm talking about indisputable facts that were stated incorrectly!\r\n\r\nIt appears as though startups.com has more users than answers.onstartups.com, but I'm not so sure that is really the case.

This is a Q&A site, and those questions do not fit this site's format. Those questions are designed to elicit opinions and discussions, not to find the right answer. I know we have a lot of subjective questions on this site, and that's fine with me, because that's the nature of the startups topic. However, I feel like the \"review my ...\" questions go way beyond simply being subjective, and can only be strictly discussion questions.\r\n 2. These questions lead to lots of spam. I'm sure there are plenty of folks out there that are truly interested in getting feedback on how to improve their product/website/etc (I'm one of them). The problem is that there are probably way more people out there that are simply interested in posting a link to their site to get traffic, and never plan on contributing to the site. I consider this to be spam, and it is very annoying to those of us that put so much effort into building this site.\r\n 3. If we ignore the above two points, and decide to allow these questions, my feeling is that we'll end up getting overrun with them. That's all we'll end up seeing on the main page, and as a result we'll end up pushing away the few experts left on this site. These types of questions are generally not interesting, and for the most part only benefit the person asking the question. Plus very few of us actually have the time it takes to review someone's website, or product, or whatever.\r\n\r\nI do see this as a genuine need for a lot of folks, but unfortunately I don't think we're the site to meet that need. I suggest we keep the question [Where can I get feedback or have my site reviewed?][2] in mind, and update it any time we discover a new review site.

This is the place to come with specific questions or to seek specific advice from your peers.\r\n\r\nI realize the site is called OnStartups, but I've heard from a large number of individuals that the challenges that intrapeneurs face within Fortune 500 (and definitely Fortune 10 companies) are quite similar to entrepreneurs: financing, getting the right industry mentors, marketing new initiatives, proposal drafting and pitching - analogous to business case writing and pitching to VCs, and getting the right team together.\r\n\r\nOf course intrapreneurship comes with its own caveats in each of these dimensions and also has some of its own challenges in being more tightly entrenched in local politics. Recently, as an intern at a Fortune 10 company, I've been proposing a new position for myself and have been learning of numerous new initiatives that are looking for support and growth within the company. So, this may detract from the initial intentions of the creators, which I would completely understand.\r\n\r\nThis site might gain a large segment of the population that may be deterred by a definition fit for a glorified group of individuals willing to risk any form of stability to be entrepreneurs when many are truly \"starting and running new businesses\" within larger organizations all over the world. Also, I think intrapreneurship is a great gateway for entrepreneurship for many and vice-versa, as can be seen in a [post by someone](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/6495/how-to-start-a-business-and-not-destroy-your-marriage/6511#6511), who felt unable to contribute as openly for the reason that they're not an entrepreneur in the traditional sense.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the ideas bears any weight, thanks again for the great site, and I hope to continue being a part of the community!"}

It's a broad topic that has a lot of aspects including: keeping your idea secret, seed funding, angels, venture capitalists or boot-strapping.\r\n\r\nEach company is unique and so is the funding strategy. The common thread among all startups is they do need capital and obtaining that capital takes a lot of effort and focus -- something most technical founders hate to spend time on.\r\n\r\nThere are several great questions and answers on funding which are presented below:\r\n\r\n* [Funding: Where to Start?](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/2763/funding-where-do-i-start): We get this question a lot and this thread has several great answers. The main take-a-way is to answer the question Do you really need funding?\r\n* [Bootstrapping Your Startup](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/17843/savings-bootstrapping-starting-up): This whole thread is chalked full of great advice. The one take-a-way is that managing your cash flow is vital.\r\n* [What to Disclose to Investors](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/496/just-been-through-the-vc-process-i-love-to-be-transparent-but-wondering-how-muc): Shares an experience with giving some investor pitches and how much information is too much.\r\n* [Angel Investors and Debt](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/32/raising-angel-money-as-debt-note-or-equity): Quite a good post on the difference between debt and equity for an angel round.\r\n\r\nAlong with how to raise money, we often get the question **When to Raise Money**. This can be tricky and obviously highly dependent on what business you are in and your burn rate.\r\n\r\nSeveral questions deal with this topic that are worth looking at. They include:\r\n\r\n* [I don't Think I Need Funding, Should I Look Anyway](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/25452/i-dont-think-i-need-funding-should-i-shop-around-anyway/): Raises a great question and the answers reflect some hard choices startups need to make.\r\n\r\n* [Can a Startup With Little Expenses Benefit From Investors?](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/25996/can-a-startup-with-little-expenses-really-benefit-from-investors): Explores why an investor may be good for you even if you are breaking even or have a low burn rate.\r\n\r\n* [Savings, Bootstrapping, Startup](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/17843/savings-bootstrapping-starting-up): Discusses the savings required for a bootstrapped startup. A good rule of thumb was a year's salary but it was also discussed when to go get funding.\r\n\r\n* [Surviving Without a Paycheck](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/57/how-do-i-survive-when-starting-a-business-without-a-paycheck): Startups typically don't make money on day one. That's the primary reason to raise money -- so you can survive and not have to dip into savings.\r\n\r\n**Also see** the posts [tagged 'Funding'](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/funding), ['Seed-Funding'](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/seed-funding), ['Investors'](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/investors) and ['Bootstrapped'](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/bootstrapped) for more discussions of this.\r\n\r\n----\r\nIf your questions fall out of these answers, then feel free to post a question.

Whereas, if someone asks about how to best trade in child sex slaves, we can pretty much agree that that is universally abhorrent, at least by the standards of this community, and close or delete the question.\r\n\r\nFor the specific examples you gave (selling drugs, prohibited business activity, violating a visa), I don't think there is a strong reason to close the question. Why not just answer with a comment along the lines of \"That would be illegal and almost no sane startup owner would take the risk of their entire business jeopardized for something like this\".\r\n\r\nDo, however, be aware that these questions are often trolls. \"Should I give free samples of my hallucinogenic product to everyone or only high school kids?\" That question is \"not a real question\" and should be closed as such, not because the activity discussed is illegal, but because it's imaginary."}

For instance, I didn't close the question about having a better slogan for Coca-Cola, even though I found it naive.\r\n\r\nOne of my concerns is which community we want to build.

I believe this is the root cause for many issues. \r\n\r\nI, for example, often find myself spending time considering whether a question would be on or off-topic, and end up not asking the question because I am not up for the potentially lengthy discussion.\r\n\r\nI believe we could solve the problem that this site is hard to define in the following general ways:\r\n\r\n - Communicating the topic clearer. This also means creating technology, which would communicate this while one tries to submit a question, so off-topic questions are never asked.\r\n - Segmenting the site using new rules/technologies for tagging. The reason for this is to make it easier for experts to exclude questions they are tired of seeing. One way is to say that we demand that the submitter of a question either tags it as an \"advanced\" or \"newbee\" question. I am not saying this is a good idea, but it is an example of such an idea.\r\n - Changing the topic of this forum. This is a lot more drastic, but one could for example broaden or narrow the topic, to make it easier to communicate."}

Some valid reasons to ask a legal question on this site may include:\r\n\r\n - Doing initial research on a topic to get a better understanding of it.\r\n - Learn what questions to ask a lawyer on a specific topic when you meet with him/her.\r\n - Find other online resources that may help you in your research.\r\n - Get a better idea if this particular legal issue is something you should worry about now, or maybe put off for a later date.\r\n\r\nAgain, I agree, this site should never be used as a substitute for a lawyer, but I do think startup legal questions are within the scope of the site, and **if used responsibly**, this site can be a valid resource."}

So OnStartups attracts the bad as well as the good.\r\n\r\ntl;dr version:\r\n\r\nOnStartups exists primarily because there is high current interest in the tech startup phenomenon, driven by publicity about social networking, \"4 hour work weeks\", VCs, and technology IPOs. \r\n\r\nThe startup scene today resembles the dot com bubble of 1997-2000 but much smaller and with less free cash floating around. \r\n\r\nAnd, there is a high unemployment rate, and many younger technology people, especially those just graduated, may be having difficulty finding traditional employment. \r\n\r\nThe point I am making is that there is a great amount of \"effervescence\" of the startup scene - lots of people dabbling in it. You have people today who believe that they are attempting to create a new business who do not have the first clue about the landscape of self employment or business creation. \r\n\r\nIn a different period in history with more affluence, say 5 years ago, a startup is the last thing that many startup \"founders\" would have considered. They would be working in an entry level job.\r\n\r\nSo they come to OnStartups -drawn by the board's subject matter - and their questions tend to reflect an extreme \"newbie\" sensibility. \r\n\r\nIt's all about them and their needs, and they don't tend to be terribly appreciative of truly realistic advice that is provided. \r\n\r\nThat's my theory, anyway. I have had what I consider decent (and realistic) answers to fundamental questions blown off as \"too critical\" or too harsh. After a few of these I won't even participate in subjects that have a whiff of naivete'. It's not worth my time.\r\n\r\nHopefully the relatively few who do have meaty questions can buoy up the quality here. "}

And, as a general rule, we enjoy learning something from people, instead of books. Even better would be hands-on, with guidance. Shit, if I could get a 1 on 1 with Seth Godin, I would do anything within my power (no joke, *anything*). \r\n\r\nWant to test this theory? Remember yourself in the beginning, lost in the business book section at B&N. Weren't you thinking: \"How the hell am I going to figure out what to do with all this *noise*?\" or \"Man, which book should I choose?\"\r\n\r\nThe 'low quality' of questions reflects the *necessity* of our collective advice. The amount of repeat questions is a fantastic problem. It means we're still needed. The young entrepeneurs who ask 'stupid' questions are willing to listen to *you*. That's a big deal.\r\n\r\nThe big miss is that a lot of what we teach entrepreneurs, especially in traditional business school, is totally irrelevant to *actually starting a business* and being your own boss. Not only do you need technical knowledge, you also need to learn *a lot* about yourself. You need to develop personality traits like persistence, focus, and responsibility, that somebody who is just starting out simply will not have.\r\n\r\nCelebrate these 'bad questions'. Answering them is the only thing that will move our industry forward. "}

I suppose the reason for allowing this is the assumption that it needs more knowledge to answer questions than to ask, so why not allow beginners to ask, rather than force them to answer questions to reach a reputation limit first.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think this is a mistaken approach. Asking good questions needs a lot of knowledge, maybe even more than answering some easier ones. This knowledge can be easily collected even by browsing the web and reading about entrepreneurship. I'm definitely not an experienced entrepreneur, but could raise my reputation to 71 in 3 days by answering questions based on my readings.\r\n\r\nSo I don't see a reason why there shouldn't be at least a minimal reputation limit to reach before people can start asking questions. At least they should have the badge for reading the faq, and posting at least one answer. I would also limit the number of questions one can ask before reaching a higher reputation, as many newcomers start by flooding us with 6-8 pointless questions in a row. These limits could raise the quality of questions significantly.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"}

Stack Exchange has the ability to pull the low quality threads from the database for us, so we won't have to manually find these low quality posts. We will, however, have to manually go through the threads we get back from Stack Exchange to decide what we want to do with each thread.\r\n\r\n**Step 1**\r\n\r\nThe first step in this process is to come up with a list of criteria we believe are indicators of a thread that needs attention. Once we have this list, we can pass it along to the Stack Exchange team and they will query the database for us. This will result in a list of threads that meet the criteria we have identified. We will then go through those threads to remove the off-topic and low quality content.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have the list of criteria finalized by the end of this week, if possible. **My question is, what are indicators of a post that may need our attention?** What criteria do we want to pass along to the Stack Exchange team?\r\n\r\nHere is what I've come up with so far:\r\n\r\n - Questions with close votes\r\n - Questions and answers with a score of -2 or less\r\n - Questions tagged [tag:ask-onstartups]\r\n - Questions that have earned the [Tumbleweed badge][2]\r\n - [Unanswered questions][3] (including those with [0 answers][4])\r\n - Questions that have been closed\r\n - Users who have not visited the site in over 8 months (or some other timeframe), and have only posted once\r\n\r\n**What else should we add to this list?**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAlso, please take a look at @Joseph's related question, on [what to do with the feedback tag.][5]\r\n\r\nLastly, I created a [cleanup chat room][6] to discuss this effort in more detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/526/onstartups-clean-up-getting-started\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/badges/21/tumbleweed\r\n  [3]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=newest\r\n  [4]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers\r\n  [5]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/530/is-there-a-legitimate-use-of-the-feedback-tag-on-the-main-board\r\n  [6]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/552/onstartups-cleanup"}

It's not just that it drives away newcomers, it drives away engaged, qualified members. In the techie world it is acceptable that people are direct, often curt. The general business world does not have this \"brevity at the cost of civility\" bias. Before anyone goes off about my lack of tech credentials, I have a degree in Computer Science and have spent my entire 30 year career in programming, development, and development management and I am quite capable of taking it (and dishing it out). However this is not the appropriate place for such a communication style. I have been well ranked here at onstartups but I stopped my involvement a few months ago because of this problem -- it seemed like the darkness was dominating the light. However such questions in meta give me hope."}

People who downvote quality answers without comment.  I spent a fair amount of time on [this answer][1].

Perhaps the downvoter found the answer confusing or misleading or something but I will never know.\r\n\r\n 2. People who post strongly worded answers when they have no idea what they are talking about.  I notice this mostly in questions that have legal aspect to them.  I won't name names, but there are some very frequent posters who fall into this category.\r\n\r\nThese two things don't seem to happen nearly as often at StackOverflow.

Sorry, but learn to live with it.  While we encourage users to take the time to comment on content they downvote to indicate how it may be improved, it's not required.  Nobody has time to do it every time they see a bad question/answer, and some people don't like calling attention to their downvote or feeling like they are reprimanding the poster in public.\r\n\r\n Don't take downvotes personally -- they're about the content, not about the person posting it.  See if you can figure out what could have been better -- if not, move on with life until someone posts an explanatory comment.  Uncommented downvotes are *more* common on SO than on our other sites -- there are simply so many people voting that chances are higher *someone* will comment.\r\n\r\n2. Downvote and provide your own, better answer.  SO does get a ridiculous amount of garbage, but the community there is much more active in downvoting the garbage to oblivion than Onstartups is.  Content quality means producing quality content, but it also means constantly cleaning house.\r\n  - If you see good content poorly written, edit it.\r\n  - If you see content that just needs a tweak or two, edit or comment.\r\n  - If you see a bad answer, downvote it.  If you feel it can be saved and have time to do so, leave a comment.\r\n  - If you see a bad question, edit/downvote as you would with an answer.\r\n  - If you see a question that doesn't fit the format, either edit it to usefulness or vote to close.\r\n\r\n     *Note that closing a question is not permanent -- it's perfectly reasonable to leave a comment about what should be fixed, then vote to close the question.  If the OP fixes it (for example, with more specific info to make the question answerable) either the close votes will expire, or the already-closed question can receive votes to re-open.*\r\n\r\nI'd *love* to see more active housekeeping being done by the OnStartups community."}

For example, they would not be able to clear any of your flags. They could, however, view your spam flags and add their own flag to the post in question to bring more attention to it. "}

Beyond that there's no way to really salvage it either in expanding the question, or my answer.  So the whole exchange is probably line noise.\r\n\r\n[This question on reviews][2] is a fairly poor question, but brings two interesting answers - I'm more inclined to leave that as it _does_ bring something (despite the 4 close votes).  Even if it's expanded to become the canonical exchange on why onstartups isn't a venue for reviews, or why they;re inappropriate here.  But it does, to me, seem orders of magnitude better than the endless one or two liners we get with a few 1 line answers, like:\r\n\r\n[Oh dear][3], what's this a link bait thread?  The question is so vague that it's just show and tell for answers - and brings nothing to the site.  If it had a little more focus, perhaps.\r\n\r\nI don't have all the answers, but I am inclined to think we get much harsher with quality of questions.  It seems to work on programmers - sometimes they're way too harsh (imo), but the overall quality of the site is good.  Here is endlessly struggling with junk, and I think that's why especially the good people give up after a while.  It gets too tedious after a while to open yet another daft question that google can answer on the first search.\r\n\r\nIs it the internet marketing effect?  ie Too many people coming here in hope of finding the magic answer to be an internet \"sensation\" without the work.\r\n\r\nOr is it simply that business and startups are just harder to pin down than programming and grammar questions?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://answers.onstartups.com/q/34868/8784\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/q/30219/8784\r\n  [3]: http://answers.onstartups.com/q/29088/8784"}

Our goal is to reduce the number of unanswered questions by taking several actions. \r\n\r\nCurrently there are a total of 384 [unanswered questions][2], with 198 of those having [no answers][3]. Some of these unanswered questions will be off-topic or low quality questions that should be closed. Others will be good questions that have been missed somehow. And others will be good questions that require an expertise we\u2019re currently lacking on the site.\r\n\r\n**Procedure**\r\n\r\nGo through the list of [unanswered questions][4] at your leisure, and perform any of the following actions:\r\n\r\n- Answer the questions you can answer.\r\n- Upvote **good** answers. *Please don\u2019t go crazy upvoting stuff you normally wouldn\u2019t.* Stick to only upvoting good posts.\r\n- If it\u2019s a good question, and you know someone outside of the community that has the expertise to answer the question, share it. For example, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. \r\n- Edit those questions that can be improved.\r\n- If a question is unclear, leave a comment asking for clarification.\r\n- If the question is off-topic or otherwise not a good fit for the site, vote to close and/or downvote. And leave a comment if you feel inclined to do so.\r\n- Vote to delete some questions.*****\r\n\r\n*Questions that have been around for a while with no answers are candidates for deletion, even if it\u2019s [not a terrible question][5]. And obviously really bad threads should also be deleted.\r\n\r\nFor those questions you feel should be closed or deleted, leave a link to them in the answer below under the appropriate category. The reason for doing so is that we have 384 unanswered questions, and the odds of everyone going through all 384 questions is close to zero. By leaving the links below it makes it easier for people to find these questions.\r\n\r\nDoing it this way also opens up the contest to more people. Note that you need 4000 rep to have the ability to vote to delete. If you have less than 4000 rep and spot a question that you think should be deleted, leave a note in the answer below next to the question\u2019s link.\r\n\r\n**Final Points**\r\n\r\nWe are not looking to end phase 2 with 0 unanswered questions; we simply want to reduce the number of unanswered questions. The most important aspect is to answer good questions that have been missed, and close and delete the really bad questions.\r\n\r\nThis phase will last 1 week, starting today and ending on January 29. On January 30 we will move on to phase 3.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/717/clean-up-contest-is-getting-underway\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered\r\n  [3]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers\r\n  [4]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered\r\n  [5]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/537"}

Our goal is to reduce the number of unanswered questions by taking several actions. \r\n\r\nCurrently there are a total of 384 [unanswered questions][2], with 198 of those having [no answers][3]. Some of these unanswered questions will be off-topic or low quality questions that should be closed. Others will be good questions that have been missed somehow. And others will be good questions that require an expertise we\u2019re currently lacking on the site.\r\n\r\n**Procedure**\r\n\r\n***You do not have to act on all 384 unanswered questions; only what you feel comfortable with.***\r\n\r\n\r\nGo through the list of [unanswered questions][4] at your leisure, and perform any of the following actions:\r\n\r\n- Answer the questions you can answer.\r\n- Upvote **good** answers. *Please don\u2019t go crazy upvoting stuff you normally wouldn\u2019t.* Stick to only upvoting good posts.\r\n- If it\u2019s a good question, and you know someone outside of the community that has the expertise to answer the question, share it. For example, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. \r\n- Edit those questions that can be improved.\r\n- If a question is unclear, leave a comment asking for clarification.\r\n- If the question is off-topic or otherwise not a good fit for the site, vote to close and/or downvote. And leave a comment if you feel inclined to do so.\r\n- Vote to delete some questions.*****\r\n\r\n*Questions that have been around for a while with no answers are candidates for deletion, even if it\u2019s [not a terrible question][5]. And obviously really bad threads should also be deleted.\r\n\r\nFor those questions you feel should be closed or deleted, leave a link to them in the answer below under the appropriate category. The reason for doing so is that we have 384 unanswered questions, and the odds of everyone going through all 384 questions is close to zero. By leaving the links below it makes it easier for people to find these questions.\r\n\r\nDoing it this way also opens up the contest to more people. Note that you need 4000 rep to have the ability to vote to delete. If you have less than 4000 rep and spot a question that you think should be deleted, leave a note in the answer below next to the question\u2019s link.\r\n\r\n**Final Points**\r\n\r\nWe are not looking to end phase 2 with 0 unanswered questions; we simply want to reduce the number of unanswered questions. The most important aspect is to answer good questions that have been missed, and close and delete the really bad questions.\r\n\r\nThis phase will last 1 week, starting today and ending on January 29. On January 30 we will move on to phase 3.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/717/clean-up-contest-is-getting-underway\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered\r\n  [3]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers\r\n  [4]: http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered\r\n  [5]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/537"}

I apologize it took us this long to get to this point. I\u2019m excited because I think it will be a great exercise for us, and we will be giving away some prizes!\r\n\r\nFor those that may not know, a while back we started a discussion about cleaning up the site to remove low quality content, and we put together [a list][2] of items we thought would be indicators of low quality posts.\r\n\r\n**Contest Rules**\r\n\r\nWe will break up the contest into phases. (Thank you Jesper for the [suggestion][3].) Each phase will involve performing a different task. I\u2019ll post a new thread for each phase once the previous phase has been completed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the contest four winners will be randomly chosen from those that have actively participated in the cleanup effort.\r\n\r\n**Contest Prizes**\r\n\r\nOne winner will be selected to receive a **$100 Amazon gift certificate**. This is the person we think did the most good for the community. (Thank you [Dharmesh][4] for [sponsoring this prize][5].)\r\n\r\nThe other three winners will each get to choose two books from the following list:\r\n\r\n - [The Web Startup Success Guide][6]  \r\n\r\n - [Founders at Work][7] \r\n\r\n - [The E-Myth Revisited][8] \r\n\r\n - [Good to Great][9] \r\n\r\n - [Start Small, Stay Small][10] \r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 1**\r\n\r\nThe first phase will be to go through questions tagged [tag:ask-onstartups] and [tag:review] to close off-topic questions. See [here][11] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 2**\r\n\r\nThe second phase will be to go through the unanswered questions to reduce the number of them. See [here][12] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 3**\r\n\r\nThe third phase will be to continue working on phase 2, as well as to go through an additional list of questions. See [here][13] for details.\r\n\r\n**Long-term Goals**\r\n\r\nThe goal of this contest is twofold: \r\n\r\n 1. Improve the quality of the site \r\n\r\n 2. Increase community involvement on meta and with site moderation\r\n\r\nHopefully after the contest is over we will be at a better place to attract more experts to the site, and finally graduate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/526/onstartups-clean-up-getting-started\r\n  [2]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/532/what-are-indicators-of-a-thread-that-needs-attention\r\n  [3]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/533\r\n  [4]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users/4/dharmesh\r\n  [5]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/736\r\n  [6]: http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Success-Guide-Books-Professionals/dp/1430219858\r\n  [7]: http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Problem-Solution/dp/1430210788\r\n  [8]: http://www.amazon.com/-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280\r\n  [9]: http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996\r\n  [10]: http://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968\r\n  [11]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/718/clean-up-contest-phase-1\r\n  [12]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/734/clean-up-contest-phase-2\r\n  [13]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/739/clean-up-contest-phase-3"}

[You're not the first](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/27534/see-who-is-upvoting-downvoting-my-question-answer) to ask for this feature, and we've seen it [requested in various forms](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/12984/is-there-a-way-to-see-who-voted-on-your-posts) over the years. \r\n\r\nVoting is anonymous because *it shouldn't matter who downvoted you*. When one receives downvotes, it's a signal *from the community* that one's post is insufficient: it needs more research, it's too broad and needs to be refined, it's poor quality and needs to be edited, *something*. All these measures together make better users, overall. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, who's to say that the 1410 rep user is better than the 141 rep user? Maybe the 141 rep user flags, downvotes, and participates frequently in meta -- while the 1410 user writes a few good answers but isn't really engaged in the workings of the community. I'm not saying that's gospel truth (it's not) but it's also not unheard of.\r\n\r\nBasically: no, we're not going to de-anonymize voting. It's an integral part of our engine."}

I apologize it took us this long to get to this point. I\u2019m excited because I think it will be a great exercise for us, and we will be giving away some prizes!\r\n\r\nFor those that may not know, a while back we started a discussion about cleaning up the site to remove low quality content, and we put together [a list][2] of items we thought would be indicators of low quality posts.\r\n\r\n**Contest Rules**\r\n\r\nWe will break up the contest into phases. (Thank you Jesper for the [suggestion][3].) Each phase will involve performing a different task. I\u2019ll post a new thread for each phase once the previous phase has been completed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the contest four winners will be randomly chosen from those that have actively participated in the cleanup effort.\r\n\r\n**Contest Prizes**\r\n\r\nOne winner will be selected to receive a **$100 Amazon gift certificate**. This is the person we think did the most good for the community. (Thank you [Dharmesh][4] for [sponsoring this prize][5].)\r\n\r\nThe other three winners will each get to choose two books from the following list:\r\n\r\n - [The Web Startup Success Guide][6]  \r\n\r\n - [Founders at Work][7] \r\n\r\n - [The E-Myth Revisited][8] \r\n\r\n - [Good to Great][9] \r\n\r\n - [Start Small, Stay Small][10] \r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 1**\r\n\r\nThe first phase will be to go through questions tagged [tag:ask-onstartups] and [tag:review] to close off-topic questions. See [here][11] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 2**\r\n\r\nThe second phase will be to go through the unanswered questions to reduce the number of them. See [here][12] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 3**\r\n\r\nThe third phase will be to continue working on phase 2, as well as to go through an additional list of questions. See [here][13] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 4**\r\n\r\nThe fourth phase involves retagging those questions that are currently [tag:untagged]. See [here][14] for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Long-term Goals**\r\n\r\nThe goal of this contest is twofold: \r\n\r\n 1. Improve the quality of the site \r\n\r\n 2. Increase community involvement on meta and with site moderation\r\n\r\nHopefully after the contest is over we will be at a better place to attract more experts to the site, and finally graduate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/526/onstartups-clean-up-getting-started\r\n  [2]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/532/what-are-indicators-of-a-thread-that-needs-attention\r\n  [3]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/533\r\n  [4]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users/4/dharmesh\r\n  [5]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/736\r\n  [6]: http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Success-Guide-Books-Professionals/dp/1430219858\r\n  [7]: http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Problem-Solution/dp/1430210788\r\n  [8]: http://www.amazon.com/-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280\r\n  [9]: http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996\r\n  [10]: http://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968\r\n  [11]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/718/clean-up-contest-phase-1\r\n  [12]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/734/clean-up-contest-phase-2\r\n  [13]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/739/clean-up-contest-phase-3\r\n  [14]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/743/clean-up-contest-phase-4"}

But you're right, we could use a tag cleanup effort.\r\n\r\nOur tags are not very organized at the moment. I think the main reason is that we started as a 1.0 site, and not going through the normal Area 51 process resulted in us not putting too much thought into some of these things. I've slowly been trying to organize the tags as I find them, but there's still a lot that need to be cleaned up. Here's the current list of [tag synonyms][1].\r\n\r\nIf you find any other tags that you feel should be deleted, explained further, or are synonyms of each other, please post it on meta, as you've done here. Alternatively,\r\n\r\n> Users with more than 1250 reputation and a total answer score of 5 or more on the tag, can suggest tag synonyms. Users with a total answer score (total upvotes minus total downvotes) of 5 or more on the tag, can vote for tag synonyms. Suggestions will be automatically approved when they reach a score of 4, and automatically deleted when they reach a score of -2. \r\n\r\nAfter we finish the current cleanup contest we'll think about how we can implement something similar to clean up the tags. Feel free to post any ideas you have on how we can implement this.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAs for your tag synonym suggestion, I agree. I think [tag:incorporating] and [tag:incorporation] are essentially the same thing. Even if they're intended to have different meanings, I think the two are so similar that it would just cause confusion to keep both of them. I'll give it a few days to see if anyone disagrees. At the end of the week I'll create a synonym pair for these.\r\n\r\nI think the [tag:dba] tag is sufficiently different from the other two that we can keep it. Doing Business As is normally used by sole-proprietors which are not incorporated.\r\n\r\nThanks for pitching in to help the site :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://answers.onstartups.com/tags/synonyms"}

This will be very similar to [phase 1][2].\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nFeedback on my idea/startup/website/name questions have been deemed [off-topic][3] for this site. New questions related to these topics are closed, but we still have some old questions lingering on the site that should be closed. We should close them to avoid confusion among our new users that may take these open questions as an indicaton that they are on-topic. \r\n\r\nMost of these feedback questions were tagged with [tag:ask-onstartups], [tag:review], or [tag:ideas]. In phase 1 we looked at the [tag:ask-onstartups] and [tag:review] tags. In phase 5 we will finish this off by looking at questions tagged [tag:ideas]. \r\n\r\n**Procedure**\r\n\r\nWe need to go through these tags and vote to close the off-topic questions. To make it easier and minimize the need to revisit valid questions, this is how it will work:\r\n\r\nI posted an answer to this thread that contains links to the questions tagged with [tag:ideas]. Pick a question from the list, and perform one of the following actions.\r\n\r\n- If the question has already been closed or deleted, delete the link from the list. \r\n- If it is a valid on-topic question, delete the link from the list. \r\n- If the question is off-topic, vote to close and leave the link in the list for others to find.\r\n\r\nThis phase will last 1 week, starting today and ending on February 26. At the end of this phase all the links should have been deleted from the answer. \r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\n\r\nYou need a minimum of 500 rep to have the ability to vote to close questions. For those that have less than 500 rep you can still participate by leaving comments if you feel a question should be closed as off-topic. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/717/clean-up-contest-is-getting-underway\r\n  [2]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/718/clean-up-contest-phase-1\r\n  [3]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/41/should-we-allow-please-give-me-feedback-on-my-site-business-plan-startup-id"}

If I had to guess, it is perhaps from a non-native English speaker in a foreign country. Further since he has a reputation of one, presumably this is his first question.\r\n\r\nClearly he could have done a much better job of asking the question, particularly by breaking it down into multiple questions, each of which involved a single topic calling for a simple answer. He really had 3 different questions rolled into 1 which is not good.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to handle a question like this? \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/36388/using-brand-logos-for-polls-on-my-website"}

This will be very similar to [phase 1][2].\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nFeedback on my idea/startup/website/name questions have been deemed [off-topic][3] for this site. New questions related to these topics are closed, but we still have some old questions lingering on the site that should be closed. We should close them to avoid confusion among our new users that may take these open questions as an indicaton that they are on-topic. \r\n\r\nMost of these feedback questions were tagged with [tag:ask-onstartups], [tag:review], or [tag:ideas]. In phase 1 we looked at the [tag:ask-onstartups] and [tag:review] tags. In phase 5 we will finish this off by looking at questions tagged [tag:ideas]. \r\n\r\n**Procedure**\r\n\r\nWe need to go through these tags and vote to close the off-topic questions. To make it easier and minimize the need to revisit valid questions, this is how it will work:\r\n\r\nI posted an answer to this thread that contains links to the questions tagged with [tag:ideas]. Pick a question from the list, and perform one of the following actions.\r\n\r\n- If the question has already been closed or deleted, delete the link from the list. \r\n- If it is a valid on-topic question, delete the link from the list. \r\n- If the question is off-topic, vote to close and leave the link in the list for others to find.\r\n\r\nThis phase will last 1 week, starting today and ending on February 26. At the end of this phase all the links should have been deleted from the answer. \r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\n\r\nYou need a minimum of 500 rep to have the ability to vote to close questions. For those that have less than 500 rep, you can still participate by leaving comments if you feel a question should be closed as off-topic, and by removing the already closed and deleted threads from the list in the answer below. Removing the closed/deleted threads from the list is actually quite helpful because it helps the higher rep users concentrate on the open questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/717/clean-up-contest-is-getting-underway\r\n  [2]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/718/clean-up-contest-phase-1\r\n  [3]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/41/should-we-allow-please-give-me-feedback-on-my-site-business-plan-startup-id"}

Ideally, they should read the FAQ before asking their first question, but we can't enforce that. It's our job to kindly guide them into becoming productive members of the site. We should do this by leaving them comments explaining the site guidelines, not by answering their off-topic/low quality questions.\r\n\r\nI think there is a much smaller subset of folks who are aware of the site guidelines, yet ask off-topic questions anyways in hopes of getting some good answers before the question is closed. \r\n\r\nThere's also a small group of people that will answer any question, regardless of question quality, simply to earn as much reputation as possible (i.e. [Rep Whores][1]). Related question: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/738/why-do-so-many-users-with-closing-vote-privileges-entertain-off-topic-and-not-co\r\n\r\nOut of the three groups I mentioned, the last two are the most dangerous to the site. There's really not a whole lot we can do about the first group, other than help them understand how the site works. And in most cases these seem to be one off.\r\n\r\n**To answer your question**, I don't see anything wrong with downvoting answers to off-topic questions, even if it is a good answer. I've thought about doing the same thing myself several times before (though I've never done it). I think it can help fight the last two groups I mentioned.\r\n\r\nSome guidelines I would use:\r\n\r\n - **Only do it in cases of *obvious* off-topic and low quality junk.** There are different opinions on what is on-topic. Maybe the person answering thinks the question is valid. I would leave answers to boderline questions alone. Maybe take the approach of not voting at all, but I wouldn't downvote these answers.\r\n - **Only do it for high rep users.** I've noticed most answers to obvious off-topic questions come from low to mid rep users. These users may still be learning our site guidelines. There's no sense in possibly alienating them when they are only trying to be helpful. For low rep users, I would say leaving them a comment (or leaving a comment on the question itself) is the better approach. If after repeated comments, they continue answering junk, then downvoting is appropriate. High rep users, on the other hand, should really know better. I think downvoting in these cases is fine. The question is, where do we draw the line between low rep and high rep? I think anyone under 200 rep definitely gets a pass, and anyone over 1000 rep should definitely know better.\r\n - **Leave a comment, if you feel inclined to do so.** Voting is anonymous, so leaving a comment is **not** required. That said, leaving comments can be useful in helping people understand site rules. Especially in cases where the answer isn't bad and may cause some confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/19522"}

(Thank you Jesper for the [suggestion][3].) Each phase will involve performing a different task. I\u2019ll post a new thread for each phase once the previous phase has been completed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the contest four winners will be randomly chosen from those that have actively participated in the cleanup effort.\r\n\r\n**Contest Prizes**\r\n\r\nOne winner will be selected to receive a **$100 Amazon gift certificate**. This is the person we think did the most good for the community. (Thank you [Dharmesh][4] for [sponsoring this prize][5].)\r\n\r\nThe other three winners will each get to choose two books from the following list:\r\n\r\n - [The Web Startup Success Guide][6]  \r\n\r\n - [Founders at Work][7] \r\n\r\n - [The E-Myth Revisited][8] \r\n\r\n - [Good to Great][9] \r\n\r\n - [Start Small, Stay Small][10] \r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 1**\r\n\r\nThe first phase will be to go through questions tagged [tag:ask-onstartups] and [tag:review] to close off-topic questions. See [here][11] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 2**\r\n\r\nThe second phase will be to go through the unanswered questions to reduce the number of them. See [here][12] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 3**\r\n\r\nThe third phase will be to continue working on phase 2, as well as to go through an additional list of questions. See [here][13] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 4**\r\n\r\nThe fourth phase involves retagging those questions that are currently [tag:untagged]. See [here][14] for details.\r\n\r\n**Contest Phase 5**\r\n\r\nThe fifth phase will be to go through questions tagged [tag:ideas] to close off-topic questions. See [here][15] for details.\r\n\r\n**Long-term Goals**\r\n\r\nThe goal of this contest is twofold: \r\n\r\n 1. Improve the quality of the site \r\n\r\n 2. Increase community involvement on meta and with site moderation\r\n\r\nHopefully after the contest is over we will be at a better place to attract more experts to the site, and finally graduate!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/526/onstartups-clean-up-getting-started\r\n  [2]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/532/what-are-indicators-of-a-thread-that-needs-attention\r\n  [3]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/533\r\n  [4]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users/4/dharmesh\r\n  [5]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/736\r\n  [6]: http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Success-Guide-Books-Professionals/dp/1430219858\r\n  [7]: http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Problem-Solution/dp/1430210788\r\n  [8]: http://www.amazon.com/-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280\r\n  [9]: http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996\r\n  [10]: http://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968\r\n  [11]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/718/clean-up-contest-phase-1\r\n  [12]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/734/clean-up-contest-phase-2\r\n  [13]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/739/clean-up-contest-phase-3\r\n  [14]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/743/clean-up-contest-phase-4\r\n  [15]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/756/clean-up-contest-phase-5"}

When a post is deleted any reputation you may have accrued on that post is reversed. See [this thread][1]. It may not seem fair, but that's the way the Stack Exchange engine works. \r\n\r\nNote that this applies to both upvotes and downvotes. So if at the time a post is deleted it has downvotes, those downvotes will be removed from the OP's reputation, and the OP will actually *gain* rep.\r\n\r\nThis change in rep due to deleted posts happens right away, however, up until now, your displayed rep would not be updated to reflect this. As a result, displayed reputation tended to be \"inflated\" (i.e. it did not reflect your \"true\" reputation, according to SE's rules). Therefore, anytime SE performed a global reputation recalc most users would see a sharp drop in their reputation. \r\n\r\nSE just performed a network wide reputation recalculation, which is why a lot of us saw a drop in our reputation. I lost about 100 rep. [The last time][2] SE performed a global recalc my rep dropped by several hundred.\r\n\r\nMoving forward reputation changes due to deleted posts will be reflected in your displayed reputation, so we should no longer see these huge drops in rep. Instead we'll see smaller sized changes more frequently.

If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.\r\n\r\nSE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.\r\n\r\n**Why do we close a question?**\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask](http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#dontask) section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:\r\n\r\n* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.\r\n* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.\r\n* Some questions belong elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThese have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.\r\n\r\n**Is closing like deletion?**\r\n\r\nNo. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put \"into improve mode\" if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.\r\n\r\n**What are the requirements for closing a question?**\r\n\r\nIf you have 500 reputation on the site currently, or 3000 reputation on a graduated site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option \"this question does not belong here\". That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.\r\n\r\n**Why can anyone vote to close/reopen**?\r\n\r\nFirstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.\r\n\r\n**How are moderators different?**\r\n\r\nModerator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.\r\n\r\nInitially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.\r\n\r\n**Ok, so how does it work?**\r\n\r\n![Example close button][1]\r\n\r\nOk, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:\r\n\r\n * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.\r\n\r\n![Close vote reasons dialog][2]\r\n\r\n * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.\r\n\r\n![Other votes][3]\r\n\r\n * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.\r\n * The \"off topic\" page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.\r\n * The other options are straight out closes.\r\n * Once you pick your option and click \"close\", your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.\r\n * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.\r\n * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.\r\n\r\n![Close banner][4]\r\n\r\n**How does vote to re-open work?**\r\n\r\nA closed question has a \"reopen\" link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.\r\n\r\nBelow, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).\r\n\r\n![Re-open link][5]\r\n\r\n**What happens if I make a mistake?**\r\n\r\nDon't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. \r\n\r\n**I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?**\r\n\r\nWell, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. \r\n\r\n**My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?**\r\n\r\nActually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.\r\n\r\n**How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?**\r\n\r\nActually there are two tools for this. \r\n\r\n * [Review][6]. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes. You are then free to look at the question and decide if you agree.\r\n * [Tools][7]. Commonly referred to as the \"10k tools\", this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page. Here, you can see questions that might have been closed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png\r\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png\r\n  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png\r\n  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png\r\n  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png\r\n  [6]: http://answers.onstartups.com/review\r\n  [7]: http://answers.onstartups.com/tools"}

Though people with 2000+ rep have access to moderator tools, which override all those requirements. Yet again, many are inactive in the community.\r\n\r\nAs for tag creation, 150 is high enough for a \"beta\" site without a large group of regulars because it requires 15 upvotes for newbies and 5 upvotes for 200+ transfers.

Ideally, they should read the FAQ before asking their first question, but we can't enforce that. It's our job to kindly guide them into becoming productive members of the site. We should do this by leaving them comments explaining the site guidelines, not by answering their off-topic/low quality questions.\r\n\r\nI think there is a much smaller subset of folks who are aware of the site guidelines, yet ask off-topic questions anyways in hopes of getting some good answers before the question is closed. \r\n\r\nThere's also a small group of people that will answer any question, regardless of question quality, simply to earn as much reputation as possible (i.e. [Rep Whores][1]). Related question: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/738/why-do-so-many-users-with-closing-vote-privileges-entertain-off-topic-and-not-co\r\n\r\nOut of the three groups I mentioned, the last two are the most dangerous to the site. There's really not a whole lot we can do about the first group, other than help them understand how the site works. And in most cases these seem to be one off.\r\n\r\n**To answer your question**, I don't see anything wrong with downvoting answers to off-topic questions, even if it is a good answer. I've thought about doing the same thing myself several times before (though I've never done it). I think it can help fight the last two groups I mentioned.\r\n\r\nSome guidelines I would use:\r\n\r\n - **Only do it in cases of *obvious* off-topic and low quality junk.** There are different opinions on what is on-topic. Maybe the person answering thinks the question is valid. I would leave answers to boderline questions alone. Maybe take the approach of not voting at all, but I wouldn't downvote these answers.\r\n - **Only do it for high rep users.** I've noticed most answers to obvious off-topic questions come from low to mid rep users. These users may still be learning our site guidelines. There's no sense in possibly alienating them when they are only trying to be helpful. For low rep users, I would say leaving them a comment (or leaving a comment on the question itself) is the better approach. If after repeated comments, they continue answering junk, then downvoting is appropriate. High rep users, on the other hand, should really know better. I think downvoting in these cases is fine. The question is, where do we draw the line between low rep and high rep? I think anyone under 200 rep definitely gets a pass, and anyone over 1000 rep should definitely know better.\r\n - **Only do it for new answers.** During the early days of this site we allowed certain types of questions that we no longer allow. We've been working on removing these old off-topic questions from the site, but I'm sure there are some we haven't gotten to yet. If a question was answered in 2009 or 2010, when it was on-topic, I don't think it's fair to downvote someone who answered the question in good faith. In this case, it's better to vote to close the question, and flag it, if appropriate.\r\n - **Leave a comment, if you feel inclined to do so.** Voting is anonymous, so leaving a comment is **not** required. That said, leaving comments can be useful in helping people understand site rules. Especially in cases where the answer isn't bad and may cause some confusion.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/19522"}

Some examples are:\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/32632/help-me-with-software-licensing-models\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/23530/how-do-i-price-my-expensive-software-and-charge-100-000-in-a-presentable-way\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/23472/creating-non-profit-startup-from-open-source-software-project \r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/36800/how-do-i-decide-on-licensing-terms-for-my-popular-app\r\n- [tag:business-permit]: Questions related to permits required by your jurisdiction to legally run your business. I don't anticipate this tag will get used much, if at all, since most questions in this category will likely fall under \"too localized\", and end up getting closed. I went with \"business-permit\" instead of \"business-license\", because I don't want the tag to get confused with business or professional certifications (e.g. CISSP). Some examples are:\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/11456/would-you-need-an-online-gambling-license-that-uses-virtual-money-that-can-be-ex\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/31484/do-you-need-a-license-to-operate-a-bus-minibus-in-california (should probably be closed as \"too localized\")\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/31323/what-permits-and-insurances-do-i-need-to-open-a-taxi-company (should probably be closed as \"too localized\")\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/12996/looking-to-start-a-cpa-practice (should probably be closed as \"too localized\")\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/13367/starting-travel-business-in-massachusetts (should probably be closed as \"too localized\")\r\n\r\n- [tag:royalties]: Questions related to earning royalties from a product. It can be an intangible product (e.g. a brand, patent, etc) or a physical product. Some not so great examples are:\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/21162/computing-valuation-of-custom-software\r\n  - http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/19615/can-anyone-share-experiences-in-licensing-content\r\n\r\n**Now, what to do with the four tags we currently have?**\r\n\r\nI suggest we do the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Make [tag:software-licensing] a synonym of [tag:software-license]. This is really just a personal preference. We can just as easily keep [tag:software-licensing], but I think [tag:software-license] is a better choice. \r\n 2. Make [tag:licence] and [tag:licensing] synonyms of [tag:license]. This is just an intermediate step to reduce the duplicate tags, and make step three less painful.\r\n 3. Retag the questions tagged [tag:license] with our new, more descriptive tags. Questions tagged [tag:license] can fall into any of the three categories I described above, so I don't think we should make [tag:license] a synonym of any of the more descriptive tags. We'll need to manually go through all the questions and retag them with the appropriate tag (i.e. [tag:software-license], [tag:business-permit], or [tag:royalties]). At the end of this we shouldn't have any questions tagged [tag:license].\r\n\r\nPeople may still recreate the tag [tag:license], so we'll need to keep an eye on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n "}

It will likely lead to to discussions and likely will lead to more people posting yet more questions for requests of market research.\r\n\r\nI think we can agree that a single forum like this is NOT the best place to do unrestricted market research - we should be encouraging people to get out and talk to customers or potential customers - not pretend that this site is suitable for data for deciding whether to pursue a product or business.  Given that, market research on startups might be considered ON-TOPIC - or at least have a meta-site of its own.  Perhaps it is for this site or a new area 51?\r\n\r\nI am open to arguments to keep them - as they seem to be popular subjects here."}

In doing so, I realized that I was acting based on incorrect assumptions. It turns out that it only takes 300 rep to create tags on graduated SE sites. The only exceptions that I found were Stack Overflow ([requires 1500 rep][1]) and MSO ([requires 500 rep][2]). (I thought it was 1500 for all graduated sites.)\r\n\r\nBased on this, my original idea of requesting that the rep required to create tags be increased on all beta sites isn't going to fly (I was going to propose 500 rep). The privileges on beta sites need to be earned at lower reputation levels than on graduated sites, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nSo, the best we can hope for is that SE will agree to make this change just for our site. And even then, the best we're likely to get is that they will match the current level of graduated sites - 300 rep.\r\n\r\nIt is going to be almost impossible to convince SE that it makes sense to make this change for us. Plus, I don't think it is worth the effort for an increase of only 150 rep. However, I am willing to make the case if the community believes this is of benefit. \r\n\r\nIf you believe this is a worthwhile exercise, upvote Karlson's question. Sharing your thoughts, both in favor and against this proposal, in answers and/or comments would also be very helpful. If there is a **strong** desire for this change from the community I will contact SE.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Original Answer:**\r\n\r\nI **completely** agree with you. \r\n\r\nI think 150 is way too low. However, there is nothing we can do about that. The 150 rep needed to create tags is a network-wide rule applied by Stack Exchange to all beta sites. Only SE can change this, and if they do change it, it will likely be a network-wide change.\r\n\r\nThis is something that would need to be brought up on meta.stackoverflow.com to get any attention. I'll bring it up to the SE team to get an initial feeler, and we'll see where it takes us.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/faq#reputation\r\n  [2]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/faq#reputation"}

My understanding is the\r\n> site is just for startups.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be appropriate to consider an analogy to an accounting question:\r\n\r\nI would consider on topic:\r\n\r\nI am starting a small business, what low cost software is available to do accounting on my PC?\r\n\r\nI am starting a business and buying a new PC, do I need to capitalize it of can I expense it?\r\n\r\n\r\nand off topic (although) great accounting questions:\r\n\r\nWhich accounting software is best for handling inter-company eliminations and consolidation? (If you are managing a conglomerate you are not a startup)\r\n\r\nHow do I insure my accounting conforms to Sarbanes-Oxley? (SOX applies to public companies, once you've gone public you are no longer a startup)\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between single-entry and double entry bookkeeping? (nothing unique to a startup)\r\n\r\n**Marketing research in particular:** The particular issue with marketing research is that to be of value it needs to be done properly and does involve a bunch of math and statistics. consider a question as simple as:\r\n\r\nI am trying to decide whether I should sell Coke or Pepsi in my new store, how do I do market research to determine what my customers prefer?\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nI'm building a website for my new on-line business to sell widgets, how do I conduct market research to select colors and fonts for the website to optimize sales?\r\n\r\nThese type of questions on how to conduct research, while clearly startup related, do not permit simple yes/no answers. In fact a complete answer to either of these questions would probably run to several pages and include terms like \"double-blind study\", \"confidence intervals\", \"sample size\" etc.\r\n\r\nViewed from the point of view of which marketing research questions permit simple answers, they pretty much boil down to the type  referenced by Zuly in her question. While the referenced question are far from examples of great questions, they definitely could be edited and improved. Personaly I like questions like:\r\n\r\nWhere can I get population data for US counties? (census bureau for free)\r\n\r\nI want to sell coffee beans online, is there any data on which countries buy the most coffee per-capita?\r\n\r\nIn the US who spends more on books, men or women?\r\n\r\nbut that's just my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://stats.stackexchange.com"}

As Zuly states, she's asked a related question:\r\n\r\n[Should we allow market research questions?][2]\r\n\r\nThough that question I believe assumes it's understood why \"market research\" questions are being closed, and her question is asking if they should now be allowed. That said, as an asker of such a question it is unclear why market research questions are being closed.  At first I misunderstood her question as an attempt to address why the question was closed, though it's now clear that her question is about if the question should be allowed. I'm not attempting to be argumentative, tricky, or for that matter lazy -- I just do not follow beyond \"that's just the way it is\" why my question was closed.\r\n\r\nMeaning per the OnStartups FAQs, my question is on a topic that allowed (that being marketing), and is practical, answerable questions based on actual problems faced by me.

Yes, there are lots of metrics that one can use to \"measure\" a site, but we don't really care about those as much as we care about a site providing expert answers to good questions. To that end, we're encouraging self-evaluations on our sites!\r\n\r\nMeta sites often see people discussing specific questions that have been closed to determine whether or not they can (or should) be reopened, but it's rare that anyone looks at questions that are open and answered. Are they better than what the Internet has to offer? Are we making the Internet better?\r\n\r\nHere's a rough guide:\r\n\r\n- Below, you'll find ten questions randomly selected from your site.\r\n- For each question, search the internet for the question as if you were the asker!\r\n- If our answer is good (complete, well-written, answers the question, found in search results, etc) then **vote it up**!\r\n- If our answer is bad (incomplete, poorly-written, off-topic, unfindable, etc) then **vote it down**!\r\n\r\nComment with anything you feel is worth noting, or to explain your voting choice. We have a rough guide to better/par/worse [right here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EQxi7.png). If your result is par, make a choice to vote up or down. \r\n\r\nRemember that our goal is to make the internet a better place. If you find yourself unable to decide how to vote, ask yourself: does this question and/or answer make the internet better? How you answer that question should determine your vote.\r\n\r\nTalk to your fellow community members about how your site is doing and what you all can improve. Above all else, remember: this is a *team effort!*"}

The question appears to ask a question that can't be answered in a way that it would be beneficial or relate to start-ups. Am I being pedantic about this, or are my concerns about the validity of this question valid?\r\n\r\nThe reason I bring it up is because I feel like the last few months the quality of this site has started to deteriorate. A lot of the questions I've seen are heavily subjective and only result in answers that are based on opinion and not fact."}

I normally leave a comment myself when closing a question.\r\n\r\n**From the perspective of the person asking the question:**\r\n\r\n - As you state in your question, it comes off much nicer when someone leaves a comment explaining their reason behind their close vote. The standard template that comes up when a question is closed is useful and serves a purpose, but it's not very personal, and it can sometimes leave people with more questions than it answers, especially for new users.\r\n\r\n - Leaving a comment gives them a chance to edit their question to address the problems/concerns before the question is closed. If the person can improve their question before the fifth vote to close is cast, they can save their question from being closed, which provides them with a better experience. Again, this is especially important for new users.\r\n\r\n**From my perspective as a moderator:**\r\n\r\n - As I mentioned, I normally leave a comment when closing a question. If someone else has already left a comment explaining the problem with the post, it saves me from having to do it. This lets me focus my time on other areas of site moderation. In some cases, I will add a comment even if someone else has already left a comment, if I think it's important to mention something that hasn't already been said.  \r\n\r\n - Sometimes people vote to close a question, and it's not immediately clear to me why. Leaving a comment helps me (and the rest of the community) determine whether we should also add our close vote. If I disagree with the close vote, it gives me an opportunity to respond with my own comment.\r\n\r\nAs @blunders mentions, we can't make comments a requirement for voting to close. However, I would encourage everyone to do so whenever they can. As people see others leaving comments, my hope is that it will also encourage them to follow along and do the same."}

Migrations should only be used when you are 100% certain that not only does the question not belong on the site where it was asked, but that it **absolutely does** belong on the site you are targeting with the migration. It is not our responsibility to migrate everything that kinda has something to do with another site.\r\n\r\nHere are two examples of why we need to use some caution when migrating:\r\n\r\n- [Please don't migrate low-quality questions to other sites][1]\r\n- [Please stop using Programmers.SE as your toilet bowl][2]\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain the background on migrations, and then I'll answer your question. You can skip down to Migration Procedure to see how to do it. \r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nThe migration tool was created to help users who asked *good* questions on the wrong site. It is not meant to be used to offload bad questions to other sites. The golden rule of question migration is [**don't migrate crap**][3].\r\n\r\nWhat that means is if it's a well thought out question, but it's off-topic for our site, we can migrate it to the appropriate SE site. If the question is off-topic for us, but it also happens to be a low quality question, then we should close it as off-topic, and leave it here. We need to keep in mind the SE guidelines regarding [Not a Real Question and Not Constructive][4] before migrating a question. A poll type of question is a bad question on any SE site. An overly broad question is a bad question on any SE site. Etc.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we don't have domain expertise in all of the SE sites. Without domain knowledge it's hard to judge whether a question is good or not. On top of that, we're not intimately familiar with the scope of all the SE sites. Not everything that has to do with programmers, for example, is on-topic for Programmers.SE. \r\n\r\nBecause of this, what some moderators have resorted to is [asking each other][5] whether a question can be migrated, or not. This is why you may have seen some of my comments referring to asking other site mods about a possible question migration. This isn't an optimal solution, but it prevents a lot of frustrations. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about migrations on the [Stack Exchange blog][6].\r\n\r\n**Migration Procedure**\r\n\r\nWith all of that in mind, here's the procedure to migrate a question.\r\n\r\nFirst, please take a moment to judge the question. If it is a bad question, vote to close as off-topic and let it be. If you feel it is a good question, then flag it for moderator attention. \r\n\r\nOn beta sites, only moderators can migrate a question. The only exception to this is the site's meta, where any user with close vote privileges can vote to migrate to the site's meta.\r\n\r\n**To migrate to our meta site:**\r\n\r\n1. Select off topic as the close reason.\r\n2. Select \"belongs on meta.answers.onstartups.com\".\r\n\r\n![belongs on meta.answers.onstartups.com][7]\r\n\r\n**To migrate to another SE site:**\r\n\r\n1. (optional) Ask the destination site if the question is a good fit for their site. You can either post a question on their meta site, as was done [here][8] and [here][9]. Or you can pop into their chatroom and ask there, if the site has an active chatroom. *Please don't do this every single time you see a marginal question. Reserve this for good questions.* If the other site wants the question, move to step 2.\r\n\r\n2. Flag the question for moderator attention.

When a post is deleted any reputation you may have accrued on that post is reversed. See [this thread][1].

So if at the time a post is deleted it has downvotes, those downvotes will be removed from the OP's reputation, and the OP will actually *gain* rep.\r\n\r\nThis change in rep due to deleted posts happens right away, however, up until now, your displayed rep would not be updated to reflect this. As a result, displayed reputation tended to be \"inflated\" (i.e. it did not reflect your \"true\" reputation, according to SE's rules). Therefore, anytime SE performed a global reputation recalc most users would see a sharp drop in their reputation. \r\n\r\nSE just performed a network wide reputation recalculation, which is why a lot of us saw a drop in our reputation. I lost about 100 rep. [The last time][2] SE performed a global recalc my rep dropped by several hundred.\r\n\r\nMoving forward reputation changes due to deleted posts will be reflected in your displayed reputation, so we should no longer see these huge drops in rep. Instead we'll see smaller sized changes more frequently. These new changes are explained [here][3].\r\n\r\n**Update:** SE changed the way reputation is calculated on deleted posts. [The new rules][4] are:\r\n\r\n> If you\u2019ve contributed something worthwhile to the site, you should keep the reputation for that even if it eventually gets deleted. \u201cWorthwhile\u201d here is defined as,\r\n>\r\n- A score of 3 or greater\r\n- Visible on the site for at least 60 days\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/18308/how-do-deleted-posts-affect-rep\r\n  [2]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/80865\r\n  [3]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/123319/recent-reputation-history-changes\r\n  [4]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/reputation-and-historical-archives/"}

I'm not a big fan of theory in entrepreneurship, which is why MBA programs are so ineffective at teaching entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, it makes sense that the most useful questions would be in the form of \"How did Pinterest scale to 1M users in their first month\". The answer could be factual and enlightening. Even better, it's easy to see that the best answers would be provided by people who worked at Pinterest at the time. And it's a draw for viewers to find out behind the scenes stories. Kind of like a \"people\" magazine for startups.\r\n\r\nInstead, due to our current rules, we are limited to generic questions such as \"How do I scale my startup to 1M users in the first month\". I don't feel like spending any effort to answer that question. They feel too beginner-oriented.\r\n\r\nGuess who is doing a great job of asking the right questions? Quora. So what do we do?"}

The entrepreneurs participating on Quora seem to be of higher quality, and thus the discussions are of better quality. Don't get me wrong, we have some great people participating on this site, but the number of wannabe entrepreneurs here is overwhelming compared to the small number of \"experts\".\r\n\r\nWe get a lot of ridiculously dumb questions from 1 rep users that never come back. A lot of these questions can easily be answered by doing a simple Google search, or are so incredibly broad they're impossible to answer without writing an entire book on it. These users aren't asking these questions because of our rules, they're asking these questions because they are completely clueless and/or too lazy to figure things out on their own. (I realize that's harsh, but it's the only explanation I've been able to come up with.)\r\n\r\nWhy are we attracting people like that, instead of the YC crowd, Scoble, etc? Even Spolsky, our CEO, doesn't spend any time on this site. So, the question is how do we attract more experienced, smart entrepreneurs? \r\n\r\nSorry, I know this isn't much of an answer.

Yes, since lots of startup strategies are very situation-specific, it often makes good sense to discuss a topic from a *case*. I agree with that part.\r\n\r\nBut most of the \"how did startup *x* achieve *y*\" questions don't seem like well considered research to me. They seem more like \"please spend *lots of time* answering this short question\".\r\n\r\nI'm sure people will learn from the answer to questions like that. But I don't feel they're good questions because:\r\n\r\n - Of the considerable amount of time they will require to *answer* well. Answering \"How did Pinterest scale to 1M users\" well could be a long, time-consuming answer to write.\r\n - That these questions might be less find-able on Google etc, because the hot startup names continuously change, and few people search for old startups.\r\n\r\n**Just to get a feel for the actual numbers,** I used the site search to search for \"how did\" and looked over the first handful of questions. There were some good ones -- but also many which were asked by low-rep users who seemed to have left our site shortly after asking.\r\n\r\n**I'm not convinced** that allowing \"how did startup *x* achieve *y*\" questions here would improve the situation. However, if others feel differently, we could always run an experiment and try to get data... And I do agree that Answers.Onstartups is struggling.\r\n\r\n"}
{"Id": 2126, "PostHistoryTypeId": 2, "PostId": 861, "RevisionGUID": "8afeaaf6-de7a-4bb7-8076-8011dcba4c98", "CreationDate": "2012-04-30T01:12:21.393", "UserId": 15284, "Text": "Quality usualy diminishes when the barrier to entry lowers. In the case of starting a business, it really is the situation. People get a lot of misinformation from the media and think anyone can make millions with their latest software idea without understanding the necessary work. Their next step is to open their favorite search engine and look a few things up. Once they hit the slightest barrier, their query will be \"startup questions\", or \"startup help\", or anything of that nature but not the description of their problem in proper terms because they don't know it. In the end, they get to this site and hit the \"Ask a question\" button posting their assinine problem without even reading the rules or trying to search the archives.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the problem is that people think that legal & accounting advice always costs money and is hard to comprehend. Most people don't even try to search for an answer to their problem because asking someone a question is always easier than finding out yourself. That's why we get so many very basic questions that are answered time & time again in one for or another.\r\n\r\nAs for community quality, part of it is how the site is being promoted. Quora is the Silicon Valley darling. It started there, attracted the local audience, and stayed there. This site started with Dharmesh (who is relatively known in SV, too) but for some reason it never gained as much traction (I wish I knew a bit more about the history here). As a result, Quora is synonymous with \"Q&A\" in the SV and that's where people go when they need an answer. However, it doesn't mean all the questions there are good. Some of them are as stupid as things we get here, such as \"Who are the 2012 summer interns in Silicon Valley?\" or \"Start up help! Need ideas. Who will be my target market for these products?\"\r\n\r\nStartups isn't the only site in SE ecosystem that suffers from hit-and-run users who don't even come back to accept an answer. There're plenty of them. The cause of such behavior is in the inherent reason why people come to such sites: they come to *resolve their own problem* not to help others or not thinking they could receive any additional value from participation. Only the few who poke around and/or come back to check the answers stick around. For everyone else, it become \"K. Thanx. Bye.\"\r\n\r\nSo what can we do to remedy all of this? The easiest thing is to step up moderation and close & delete all bad questions on sight without waiting for community response. We can also try to request more moderator slots to make sure there's at least one sweep of the site every hour of the day. (I know some will object but there's no way to keep a house clean without forcing everyone to clean up after themselves.) The second part of the solution is to work with SE HQ and figure out whether they want to promote the site among experienced entrepreneurs & investors to bring more quality answers as well as street buzz (one of the reasons for Quora's success was that you could answer a question and get a high-profile expert's answer to it)."}

There were 3 questions migrated here from Econ.SE. \r\n\r\n- I deleted one question on site because it was way off-topic for us. My deletion resulted in the migration being reversed, and the question is now back on the Econ.SE site. Here is the question: http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/40/is-greshams-law-relevant-for-modern-online-games-that-allow-the-use-of-real-mon?noredirect=1\r\n- The second question migrated here was IMO borderline, but mostly off-topic. I thought about it for a while, and then decided to delete it as well after it received a close vote. Again, this caused the migration to be reversed, and that question is here: http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/135/are-large-companies-more-profitable-than-small-ones?noredirect=1 (I'm open to hearing arguments for it staying here.) \r\n- The third migrated question is on-topic, and is here: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/38628/social-entrepreneurship-vs-commercial-entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nAfter the first 2 off-topic questions were migrated here I left the Econ.SE folks a [comment][1] asking if they could ask us before migrating any further questions, and I [suggested][2] that they could compile a list of the questions they think are potential candidates for OnStartups, then posting a question on our meta site listing those questions for our review.\r\n\r\nBTW, I did take a cursory look at the Econ.SE site, but did not find anything relevant to our site.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.economics.stackexchange.com/questions/165/salvaging-questions-by-migration#comment215_167\r\n  [2]: http://meta.economics.stackexchange.com/questions/165/salvaging-questions-by-migration#comment218_167"}

I can pretty much guarantee that \"people who worked at Pinterest\" would not stop by to answer the question.  \r\n\r\nQuora has a lot of backing from Silicon Valley. The entrepreneurs participating on Quora seem to be of higher quality, and thus the discussions are of better quality. Don't get me wrong, we have some great people participating on this site, but the number of wannabe entrepreneurs here is overwhelming compared to the small number of \"experts\".\r\n\r\nWe get a lot of ridiculously dumb questions from 1 rep users that never come back. A lot of these questions can easily be answered by doing a simple Google search, or are so incredibly broad they're impossible to answer without writing an entire book on it. These users aren't asking these questions because of our rules, they're asking these questions because they are completely clueless and/or too lazy to figure things out on their own. (I realize that's harsh, but it's the only explanation I've been able to come up with.)\r\n\r\nWhy are we attracting people like that, instead of the YC crowd, Scoble, etc? Even Spolsky, our CEO, doesn't spend any time on this site. So, the question is how do we attract more experienced, smart entrepreneurs? \r\n\r\nSorry, I know this isn't much of an answer. I just don't know how to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n "}

I was amazed at some of the questions that were being asked and even more so that they were getting upvoted. A majority of the questions were either really amateurish, or really badly phrased and required more details to answer properly. For example two questions I still remember are: *Where can I buy books?* and *How can I beat the competition?*. I expect to see some questions like that on all sites (including answers.onstartups.com), but it says a lot about the quality of the site when most of the questions are of that caliber. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the answers was just as bad. There were a lot of answers that were getting upvotes that were completely wrong. And I'm not talking about subjective answers where I had a different opinion, I'm talking about indisputable facts that were stated incorrectly!\r\n\r\nIt appears as though startups.com has more users than answers.onstartups.com, but I'm not so sure that is really the case. There is some suspicion that [startups.com users create various accounts][2] to populate their site and vote each other up.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I haven't been to startups.com in several months, so it's totally possible that things have changed over there. But if the quality is still the same, **I think merging them with us is a big mistake, and will only bring down the quality of our site.

Seems a bit harsh? Ok, well, this guide is here to help explain *why* your question has been closed. This has been covered briefly [in the FAQ](http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#close) too.\r\n\r\n**Is closure permanent?**\r\n\r\nAbsolutely not. Closed questions are only prevented from receiving additional answers; they're even still visible to all members of the site.\r\n\r\nThis might sound like a bad thing - it isn't. The concept of closure is that we prevent answers coming in that make guesses or assumptions based on an incomplete question, or are just plain bad, *until* the question has been improved. We are all about quality and question closure is out way to ensure users spend their time generating quality answers.\r\n\r\n**Does a closed question count against me?**\r\n\r\nNot in a reputation sense (unless you have also been downvoted). However, if a sufficient number of your questions are closed, the system may automatically ban you from asking additional questions. Similarly, a moderator may take action before then.\r\n\r\nIf a moderator takes action, they will likely contact you, explain the problem and what you need to do to improve. Take note and all should be fine.\r\n\r\nIf the system takes action, you will receive an orange bar notification. Moderators have no way to tell if you have been banned from asking questions via this mechanism and we cannot lift it, either. You will have to have had a sufficient quantity of questions closed to trigger this, however.\r\n\r\n**Ok, so why was my question closed?**\r\n\r\nUnderneath each question, there is a banner which explains why your question was closed, giving a few short reasons. Here, I will expand on these:\r\n\r\n * Exact duplicate - this type of closure is exactly what it sounds. We already have a question covering that material and it would be better if the material is to be revisited for those answers to be edited and improved on, rather than creating a whole set of duplicate answers.\r\n * Not constructive - some questions are just not suited to the format we use here. These include lists, polling or opinion questions that eat up the time of our members, who are here to help people with their problems and learn about startups in a constructive, problem-by-problem manner.\r\n * Not a real question - questions closed as NARQ fit into two categories; the first is that your question simply doesn't make sense or is so poorly worded it's almost a crime people are reading it. The second is that your question, whilst valid, is just too broad to be covered over the internet and really needs to be broken into manageable chunks.\r\n * Too localized - questions closed with this reason refer to a very narrow scenario, or are, for example, only useful to you and in no way would be useful to other people with the same problem.\r\n\r\n**What about off topic questions?**\r\n\r\nSometimes, a question is good, but just doesn't fit here on OnStartups. In this case two things will happen:\r\n\r\n * The question will be migrated to another Stack Exchange site.\r\n * The question will be closed as purely off topic.\r\n\r\n[Migration is a privilege][1], not a right. If your question has been migrated, a moderator has gone to the effort to get it moved; however, there is no onus on us to migrate questions anywhere. If your question is poorly formatted, we are unlikely to move it.\r\n\r\n**How do I get my question re-opened?**\r\n\r\nOccasionally, questions are closed by mistake. This is a rare occurrence and will usually be rectified pretty quickly when we realise this has happened.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of steps you can take to get your question improved and increase your chances of re-opening:\r\n\r\n 1. Read about what questions are [on topic](http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#questions) and [off topic](http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#dontask) in the FAQ.\r\n 2. Decide if your question was really a fit for SE in the first place. Not all questions are. However, you may well be able to re-word it into such a way that it *does* fit. Do have a ready of point 3:\r\n 3. Work through each of the articles on the [how to ask](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/how-to-ask) page. Specifically, I would highlight the following:\r\n    * Is your question properly formatted?\r\n    * Have you checked your spelling and punctuation?\r\n    * Have you explained your problem sufficiently?\r\n 4. Underneath your question there is an edit link:\r\n\r\n    ![Screenshot of edit link][2]\r\n\r\n    Use this to improve your question. **Take your time** and ensure you put sufficient effort in. \r\n 5. When you are sure you have edited the question and framed it in the best possible way, you may do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    * Contact us in [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1293/onstartups). Users capable of re-opening are not always around, but it may help to ask for feedback and get other user's opinions.\r\n    * A moderator should have commented on your post. You can reply to them using the following format:\r\n\r\n            @moderator_name Hello, I've edited my question, can \r\n            you please let me know if it is suitable for re-opening?\r\n\r\n    * Alternatively, you can flag for moderator attention using the flag link underneath your question and filling out the custom reason box:\r\n\r\n    ![Flag dialog][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/831\r\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/T9Z3Y.png\r\n  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lKBoW.png"}

You can read about the program here: [**Moderators Pro Tempore**](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/).\r\n\r\nI am pleased to announce that these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that each community\u2019s issues are properly addressed:\r\n\r\n![alt text][1] ![alt text][2] ![alt text][3]  \r\n![alt text][4] ![alt text][5] ![alt text][6]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want to make this site a huge success, and these members are great examples of exactly the type of people we need to make this site succeed. Please welcome them for the hard work and time they contribute.\r\n\r\n###Did I overlook anyone? \r\n\r\nAlmost certainly. There are members who are actively involved and very deserving of recognition. My failure to account for everyone this early on is in *no way* a slight against them. Ideally, Moderators are elected by the community and that's why **you'll have your elections after the Beta period.**\r\n\r\nMost of all, be respectful and understanding of the Moderators Pro Tem. Members of your community are volunteering their time and learning on the job. It\u2019s a learning experience for everyone. \r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Please welcome your two newest mods!\r\n\r\n[![jesper][7]][8]\r\n\r\n[![timj][9]][10]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/RKyvW.png\r\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4va6.png\r\n  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NMBV0.png\r\n  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/kIEc4.png\r\n  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/nkcqK.png\r\n  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/V36Nl.png\r\n  [7]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users/flair/1261.png\r\n  [8]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users/1261/jesper-mortensen\r\n  [9]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users/flair/1172.png\r\n  [10]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users/1172/timj"}

Many sites propose using community wiki to allow content that is on-topic and useful, but can be considered borderline or questionable in other ways. Someone notes that a certain class of question has problems, and proposes using community wiki as a quick fix.\r\n\r\n> If a question is valuable enough that you believe it belongs on the site, chances are you don\u2019t need it to be community wiki! We welcome all contributions which improve the quality of a site and advertise its greatness to the rest of the world. If you allow a certain class of questions, but only under the stipulation that no one can earn reputation from them, you\u2019ve strongly discouraged these sorts of questions. People aren\u2019t going to put in nearly as much effort to ask them.\r\n\r\n> Instead, strive for quality. If you\u2019re unsure a certain question class belongs on the site, don\u2019t tolerate the worst examples \u2014 demand that these questions be awesome. Questions shouldn\u2019t be swept under the rug with community wiki; they should get the same respect and treatment as the rest of your Q&A. If those questions are something you are uncomfortable showing to visitors \u2026 they probably don\u2019t belong on your site.\r\n\r\n_If_ the OnStartups community decides that reference requests are valuable for the site, there's no point in marking them Community Wiki. If not, then there's no point in hosting those questions all together, Community Wiki or not. The problem here is not that these questions generate cheap rep for the participants, but that they don't add to the overall quality of the site, and Community Wiki is only meant to lower the editing threshold and not as an excuse for poor questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://answers.onstartups.com/faq\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/a/25667/18021\r\n  [3]: http://answers.onstartups.com/a/25650/18021\r\n  [4]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/8259/162704\r\n  [5]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/\r\n  [6]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/01/the-trouble-with-popularity/\r\n  [7]: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/books\r\n  [8]: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bbooks%5D%20closed:1\r\n  [9]: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&q=%5Bbooks%5D%20closed:0\r\n  [10]: http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/2003/are-book-recommendations-on-topic\r\n  [11]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/"}

Whenever someone is searching on one or more tags, the platform should weave in questions that have the anti-tag (so there's a **scoring** algorithm needed, because a tag may have multiple anti-tags)\r\n\r\n1.

There is still a lack of community engagement. That looks to us like one of the biggest problems with the site right now - a bunch of users are MIA and inactive, and user retention seems to be slowing down.\r\n\r\nMost of the issues from the previous evaluation seem to still apply. This site needs strong leadership to emerge from its users and help out those who have already stepped up. But even beyond that, every little bit of help ...well... helps. Anybody can submit edits, flag inappropriate questions, and so on. The moderators on this site are doing an admirable job keeping it going, but they can always use a hand and any help they get will make this community stronger."}

I'm looking for community feedback.*\r\n\r\nThe [Business of Software conference](http://businessofsoftware.org) is a couple of months away. In the past, Stack Exchange has sponsored community members to relevant community events, and I'd like to try to get someone from the OnStartups community a sponsorship to this year's Business of Software conference.\r\n\r\n**How It Will Work**\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the Stack Exchange conference sponsorships is to increase awareness of the site and recruit new members. So with that in mind, here's my idea:\r\n\r\nWe'll run a contest here on the OnStartups site to choose one winner to attend the conference. To be eligible, the OnStartups community member must write a blog post related to a question and answer thread from this site. The community member must link to the Q&A thread related to their blog post, and expand on what has already been mentioned or add a new perspective to it. \r\n\r\nThe blog post will be hosted on the [Business of Software blog][1] as a guest post.* Once a blog post has been published on the BoS blog, we'll post a link to it here on meta. Each blog post will be listed as a separate answer, then the community can vote for each blog post individually. The author of the blog post with the most votes will get the conference sponsorship.\r\n\r\n**Benefit**\r\n\r\nThe idea is to get in front of a large audience of business and startup enthusiasts, and hopefully encourage some of them to become active participants of our community.\r\n\r\n**Details To Work Out**\r\n\r\nSince the goal is to attract experts to participate on our site, we'll want to showcase good, quality content. Therefore, we'll want to make sure we are picking good Q&A threads from our site, and not old threads that are no longer good examples of Q&A on the site. We'll have to figure out a way to vet the threads being selected for the blog posts. I'm not sure on the best way to do this, so I'm looking for feedback from you all.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are probably other issues I haven't thought of. **I'm looking for ideas, thoughts, or feedback on this idea.**\r\n\r\nI have not approached Stack Exchange about this yet. I'd like to get community involvement before I approach them with this idea. If SE sees that the OnStartups community is strongly behind this, odds are they will agree to this. **That means you need to comment, answer, and vote on this thread if you want it to happen.** \r\n\r\n**What do you think of this? Would you be willing to write a blog post for a chance at a conference sponsorship? Any details I'm overlooking?** Please discuss.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n*This won't be a problem.

It could be that we as a community did not do a good job answering their questions, or that their questions are badly worded and could use some editing help. I think it's fairly obvious that the example you cite in your question is a case of a bad citizen, and not a reflection of our community's expertise. In fact, according to that user's profile he has voted 0 times! But let's put that aside for the moment. \r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nA lot of folks on Meta Stack Overflow dislike seeing comments regarding accept rates, even if it's done in a friendly manner. On Stack Overflow, accept rate comments are routinely [flagged and deleted][2]. There is even a feature request to [eliminate displaying a user's accept rate][3]. I think the disdain for accept rate comments stems from the fact that some of the comments may have come across as rude, but I can't say for sure.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think this is one of those areas where we have the freedom to come up with our own guidelines as a community.\r\n\r\n**What should be the OnStartups policy?**\r\n\r\nWe should decide as a community how we want to handle these type of comments, but personally, I don't see anything wrong with leaving new users guidance on how accepting an answer works, as long as it is done in a friendly manner. We are encouraged to teach new users how our site works in every other area, so why not with accepting answers?\r\n\r\nI can tell you that as of right now the OnStartups community does not flag these type of comments. And if I see them, I do not delete them, assuming the comments aren't rude. (I'm currently following the [advice here][4], which says that friendly comments are fine.) To me these comments are in the same category as comments explaining what constitutes an answer and why non-answers are deleted, comments explaining why a question is off-topic for our site, or any other comment that aims to instruct a new user on how our somewhat unique rules work.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is that it is fine to leave comments on accepting answers as long as:\r\n\r\n- It is a friendly comment.\r\n- It focuses on **how** accepting an answer works, and not on the individual's current accept rate.\r\n- [optional] It contains a link to http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work.\r\n\r\nMaybe something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n> Welcome to OnStartups! I noticed that you have a low accept rate. You may not be aware of it, but our site gives you ability to choose which was the best answer you received. It's a nice way of saying \"thank you\" to those that helped you. It also serves as an indicator to others that are having a similar problem. You can learn about how accepting an answer works [here](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work). \r\n\r\n**What shouldn't we do?**\r\n\r\nWhat we don't want to do is badger people about their accept rates, or encourage people to [accept a wrong or non-useful answer][5] just for the sake of getting their accept rate up. The point of accepting an answer is to signal to the rest of the Internet that, that was the most helpful answer. We don't want others to base their business decisions on bad advice. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/23321/is-it-appropriate-to-comment-on-peoples-accept-rate\r\n  [2]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/110644/comment-regarding-accept-rate-removed\r\n  [3]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/136951/lets-stop-displaying-a-users-accept-rate\r\n  [4]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/66782/152571\r\n  [5]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/134069/should-i-accept-wrong-answers-to-boost-my-accept-rate"}

I need a few more people to come forward before I can take this to SE for approval.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n*(**This is just an idea at the moment. I'm looking for community feedback.**)*\r\n\r\nThe [Business of Software conference](http://businessofsoftware.org) is a couple of months away. In the past, Stack Exchange has sponsored community members to relevant community events, and I'd like to try to get someone from the OnStartups community a sponsorship to this year's Business of Software conference.\r\n\r\n**How It Will Work**\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the Stack Exchange conference sponsorships is to increase awareness of the site and recruit new members. So with that in mind, here's my idea:\r\n\r\nWe'll run a contest here on the OnStartups site to choose one winner to attend the conference. To be eligible, the OnStartups community member must write a blog post related to a question and answer thread from this site. The community member must link to the Q&A thread related to their blog post, and expand on what has already been mentioned or add a new perspective to it. \r\n\r\nThe blog post will be hosted on the [Business of Software blog][1] as a guest post.* Once a blog post has been published on the BoS blog, we'll post a link to it here on meta. Each blog post will be listed as a separate answer, then the community can vote for each blog post individually. The author of the blog post with the most votes will get the conference sponsorship.\r\n\r\n**Benefit**\r\n\r\nThe idea is to get in front of a large audience of business and startup enthusiasts, and hopefully encourage some of them to become active participants of our community.\r\n\r\n**Details To Work Out**\r\n\r\n- Since the goal is to attract experts to participate on our site, we'll want to showcase our good, quality content. Therefore, we'll want to make sure we are picking good Q&A threads from our site, and not old threads that are no longer good examples of Q&A on the site. We'll have to figure out a way to vet the threads being selected for the blog posts. I'm not sure on the best way to do this, so I'm looking for feedback from you all.\r\n\r\n- Since this is an OnStartups community event, we want to reward someone from the community. So, do we want to set a minimum rep required to participate? I think we should in order to prevent people who have no interest in the community from showing up, entering the contest, and never coming back. If we do set a minimum rep, what should it be? I'm thinking it should be something low, like less than 300 rep.\r\n\r\n- In addition, there are probably other issues I haven't thought of. **I'm looking for suggestions and feedback on this idea.**\r\n\r\nI have not approached Stack Exchange about this yet. I'd like to get community involvement before I approach them with this idea. If SE sees that the OnStartups community is strongly behind this, odds are they will agree to this. That means you need to comment, answer, and vote on this thread if you want it to happen. \r\n\r\n**What do you think of this? Would you be willing to write a blog post for a chance at a conference sponsorship? Any details I'm overlooking?** Please discuss.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n*This won't be a problem. The BoS organizer has already approved the use of the BoS blog for this. \r\n\r\n  [1]: http://businessofsoftware.org/blog"}

Fourth is merely a \"me too\" statement \u2013 adds nothing of value. If the only problem with the code is OP's clumsiness or if it's a dupe, they should be closed as \"Too localized\" or \"Exact duplicate\" respectively. If the former, the question should also be deleted (either by a mod or by 10k+ users). While #7 is helpful, it still doesn't answer the _question_. It is good practice to let the OP know that things have changed. If they don't respond, downvote and either move on or write a better answer if you know.\r\n\r\nResponses #8,9 and 11 are what we'd like to see on this site. They are to the point, precise and informative. If you're referencing an earlier answer (could also be an external link), provide a crucial summary so as to make the answer self sufficient. This is important for two reasons: having the summary helps in the case of link rot (i.e., external links are dead because their site shut down) and to not have to make people click through a whole bunch of links just to get to the answer. They can proceed if they like what they see. It always helps to link to the relevant documentation/authoritative sources (quoting the important information) in your answers. Remember, in all these cases, you should cite the source(s) that you quoted (it is a good practice to make it explicit that you're quoting yourself). Feel free to edit them in an answer (not yours) if the OP hasn't done so, for after all, this is a collaboratively edited site.\r\n\r\nResponses #10 and #12 are curt, and perhaps the most contentious of all. These are quite tricky as they do in fact answer the question, but not in a way that is considered a good answer. Moderators and frequent users generally try to encourage these users to expand on them or quote relevant parts. True, it is tempting to just leave a link and walk off as in #12. However, remember that the answers that you're leaving are not just for the person who asked the question, but for practically anyone who visits that page. If you're not willing do that, then it probably is a good idea to not post that link in the first place. #10, while technically the solution to the question, gives no indication or explanation as to _why_ that is the solution. Beyond this, there is nothing much that can be done other than let the votes speak for itself. However, if you flag these as \"Not an answer\", you better be prepared for a loss in flag-weight. The only time it's acceptable to bring these to a moderator's attention is if the link is dead and there's nothing to indicate what might've been there.\r\n\r\nResponses #13\u201315 are self explanatory, but please, do not encourage users who post #15 to ask questions here.\r\n\r\n"}

It's a concern, for sure, but the big problem with legal questions is that they can't be answered authoritatively.\r\n\r\nStack Exchange answers should strive to *be* the authoritative answer. When people come from Google searches, the answers they see should hopefully provide them with the answers they seek.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do believe legal issues are part of the Startup space; therefore, I propose doing what some sites have done with subjective questions:  Implement  the \"back it up\" rule for any answers that have a legal component to them. If you're going to answer the question, you either need to quote a source or explain how you dealt with the same issue in your own experience.\r\n\r\nAnswers that don't comply with the \"back it up\" rule could, and probably should, be downvoted, and a comment could be left encouraging the answerer to make an edit and improve the post.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, at the end, it's also wise to add a disclaimer, just to let anyone know that they really *do* need to talk to a lawyer for maximum risk-reduction."}

The FAQ here is pretty broad:\r\n\r\n> Answers.onstartups.com is a site for entrepreneurs starting and running new businesses.\r\n\r\n> Topics include financing, hiring employees, legal, marketing, sales, compensation plans, banking, payroll, benefits, and more. This is the place to come with specific questions or to seek specific advice from your peers.\r\n\r\nIf you're a freelancer, and your question is about a problem you're facing starting your freelancing business, it's probably on-topic. With that said, I'd strongly suggest avoiding anything that leans towards discussions, unless you do it in [OnStartups Chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1293/onstartups). Also, make sure your question has plenty of detail about *your* particular problem. This typically means your question will need to be more than just a mere sentence or two.\r\n\r\nLastly, consider that the purpose of Stack Exchange sites, such as OnStartups, is to be a resource of knowledge not just for you, but for future visitors, so if your question is something that others may Google for, and the answers would help those people as well, then that would be a great question for the site!\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"}

If you have a specific question, that's fine, but if you want feedback on your business, ask your friends and colleagues, and, even better, ask some people who might be your customers.\r\n> - \"Help me come up with a business idea\" or \"Help me come up with a company name\".\r\n\r\nThe close reason on your post states (with my own added emphasis): \r\n\r\n> As it currently stands, this question is not a good fit for our Q&A format. We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or specific expertise, but this question will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or **extended discussion**. If you feel that this question can be improved and possibly reopened, see the FAQ for guidance.\r\n\r\nWhile you aren't wrong -- analyzing the movements of major players can prove beneficial to entrepreneurs, *this is not the place for those questions*. Here, we are focused on the launching and running of a brand new enterprise. Your question, about an established and market-dominant company's actions, fits neither requirement. \r\n\r\nWhat you're asking is something an MBA seminar might tackle. While your question is *in no way invalid*, it also isn't the type of question that we are built for. Stack Exchange is a platform where concrete, answerable questions can find a home. A question like yours, which is good for a forum, group discussion, web-/seminar, or podcast, is too broad for what we do here.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps; if not, let me know and I'll do my best to clarify."}

We should get rid of the advice tag. That tag has been on my radar for some time now. I just haven't had the time to take on that task. \r\n\r\n**Why should it be removed?**\r\n\r\n[tag:advice] is a meta tag that does nothing to help you figure out what the question is about. As you said, in essence all questions on this site are seeking advice in some form or another. \r\n\r\nThere's a [blog post][1] that explains what meta tags are and why they're not allowed.\r\n\r\n**How can we remove it?**\r\n\r\nWe have two options for eliminating the tag:\r\n\r\n- **Manual:** We would need to manually go into every question tagged [tag:advice] and remove the tag from the question. Sadly, [tag:advice] is the second most popular tag on this site, currently with 805 instances. Going the manual route is a huge undertaking, especially when you consider that only a handful of us will be working on this. Another downside to the manual approach is that even if we manage to remove it from all current questions, it can still be recreated in the future.\r\n- **Automatic:** Stack Exchange has the ability to blacklist tags. This would automatically remove the tag from all questions, and prevent it from being used in the future. Moderators do not have the power to blacklist tags, so we would need to ask one of the Stack Exchange developers to do this for us.\r\n\r\nMy preference is to ask Stack Exchange to blacklist the tag. However, they're not big fans of blacklisting tags, so I'm not sure if they will agree to it.

(assuming others here are fine with my suggestion)\r\n\r\nThe rules for [suggesting and creating tag synonyms]( http://answers.onstartups.com/tags/ideas/synonyms) are:\r\n\r\n> Users with more than 1250 reputation and a total answer score of 5 or more on the tag, can suggest tag synonyms. Users with a total answer score (total upvotes minus total downvotes) of 5 or more on the tag, can vote for tag synonyms. Suggestions will be automatically approved when they reach a score of 4, and automatically deleted when they reach a score of -2.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, moderators have the ability to immediately create tag synonyms. Since we currently don't have too many active users with the ability to suggest and approve tag synonyms, all tag synonyms so far have been done by moderators. We usually try to get consensus on meta before creating the synonyms, so if you get support for your suggestions here, I\u2019ll be happy to create the synonyms.\r\n\r\n> \"customer-feedback\" should be a synonym to \"feedback\"\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not a fan of [tag:feedback]. I think it\u2019s too generic and ambiguous, and doesn\u2019t really help identify the topic of the question, which is the purpose of tags. It may also give new users the false impression that it\u2019s OK to ask for feedback on startup ideas, business names, pitches, etc. We even discussed [eliminating the tag altogether]( http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/530/is-there-a-legitimate-use-of-the-feedback-tag-on-the-main-board) during our last cleanup effort. \r\n\r\nI would prefer to see [tag:feedback] as a synonym to [tag:customer-feedback], although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a good idea to make a broad tag a synonym of a much narrower tag. Are there other types of feedback, other than customer feedback, that would be on-topic for this site? I can\u2019t think of any off the top of my head right now, but there might be. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to leave [tag:customer-feedback] as is, and manually remove [tag:feedback] from the five questions that are currently tagged with it. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n> Make \"product-launch\" a synonym to \"launch\".\r\n\r\nI\u2019m fine with this suggestion if others agree.\r\n\r\n"}

Maybe we can try again next year. I posted summaries of all the presentations on the Business of Software blog. You can get to them from [here][1].\r\n\r\n**Update (Aug 9):** This has received a lot of upvotes, but so far only two people have said they are willing to write a blog post. I need a few more people to come forward before I can take this to SE for approval.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n*(**This is just an idea at the moment. I'm looking for community feedback.**)*\r\n\r\nThe [Business of Software conference](http://businessofsoftware.org) is a couple of months away. In the past, Stack Exchange has sponsored community members to relevant community events, and I'd like to try to get someone from the OnStartups community a sponsorship to this year's Business of Software conference.\r\n\r\n**How It Will Work**\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the Stack Exchange conference sponsorships is to increase awareness of the site and recruit new members. So with that in mind, here's my idea:\r\n\r\nWe'll run a contest here on the OnStartups site to choose one winner to attend the conference. To be eligible, the OnStartups community member must write a blog post related to a question and answer thread from this site. The community member must link to the Q&A thread related to their blog post, and expand on what has already been mentioned or add a new perspective to it. \r\n\r\nThe blog post will be hosted on the [Business of Software blog][2] as a guest post.* Once a blog post has been published on the BoS blog, we'll post a link to it here on meta. Each blog post will be listed as a separate answer, then the community can vote for each blog post individually. The author of the blog post with the most votes will get the conference sponsorship.\r\n\r\n**Benefit**\r\n\r\nThe idea is to get in front of a large audience of business and startup enthusiasts, and hopefully encourage some of them to become active participants of our community.\r\n\r\n**Details To Work Out**\r\n\r\n- Since the goal is to attract experts to participate on our site, we'll want to showcase our good, quality content. Therefore, we'll want to make sure we are picking good Q&A threads from our site, and not old threads that are no longer good examples of Q&A on the site. We'll have to figure out a way to vet the threads being selected for the blog posts. I'm not sure on the best way to do this, so I'm looking for feedback from you all.\r\n\r\n- Since this is an OnStartups community event, we want to reward someone from the community. So, do we want to set a minimum rep required to participate? I think we should in order to prevent people who have no interest in the community from showing up, entering the contest, and never coming back. If we do set a minimum rep, what should it be? I'm thinking it should be something low, like less than 300 rep.\r\n\r\n- In addition, there are probably other issues I haven't thought of. **I'm looking for suggestions and feedback on this idea.**\r\n\r\nI have not approached Stack Exchange about this yet. I'd like to get community involvement before I approach them with this idea. If SE sees that the OnStartups community is strongly behind this, odds are they will agree to this. That means you need to comment, answer, and vote on this thread if you want it to happen. \r\n\r\n**What do you think of this? Would you be willing to write a blog post for a chance at a conference sponsorship? Any details I'm overlooking?** Please discuss.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n*This won't be a problem. The BoS organizer has already approved the use of the BoS blog for this. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://businessofsoftware.org/2012/12/index-of-the-2012-presentations\r\n  [2]: http://businessofsoftware.org/blog"}

Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, so be it. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers. \r\n>\r\nIf a huge percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons. Our advertising rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad sales team for details. We also offer free community promotion ads for open source projects and non-profit organizations. \r\n\r\nSo there are two components to this:\r\n\r\n- Disclosure\r\n- Percentage\r\n\r\nDisclosing their affiliation with the product or service is a must. If they do that, that's great, however there is still the issue of excess:\r\n\r\n> ... and if some (**but not all**) happen to be about your product or website, so be it.\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n> If a huge percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nSo, even if they disclose their affiliation with the product or service, if a majority of their posts are designed to promote their product/service, I would consider it to be spam.\r\n\r\nHow the post is handled depends.\r\n\r\n- If all of their posts include a link to their website and there is very little useful content, flag as spam. We usually delete these. \r\n- If all, or most, of their posts include an advertisement for their product/service, but the posts contain useful information, leave the user a comment with a link back to the self-promotion section of FAQ (or this meta thread), and edit out the promotional parts of the post. You may also want to explain that the user profile is the place to advertise themselves. Alternatively, you can flag for moderator attention explaining that most of the user's posts contain self-promotion.\r\n- If this is a user's first post, leave them a comment and edit out the promotional part.\r\n\r\nWhat I've found is that if a user's first couple of posts contain some kind of self-promotion, they are usually here for the wrong reasons. And as soon as they find out overt self-promotion is not welcomed here, they leave.\r\n\r\n"}

The US works on the [Uniform Commercial Code][2] where state attorney generals butt heads on the substantive portions, then leave minor tinkering to individual states. What IMHO should definitely be knocked on head are tax/accounting issues as there are so many (and changing) policies that a full answer wouldn't be coherent or so lengthly to deserve a book. \r\n\r\nI'm fortunate in that my specialty of Intellectual property and to a large extent IT is global (thanks to [WIPO][3]) but for other questions (eg labor laws) there are broad distinctions between US, European, Anglo-saxon (the commonwealth countries) and civil jurisdictions like India/China.

If an action is taken on something after you've flagged it, the action is attributed to the moderator that processed your flag, and perhaps a few people who had also voted to take the same action that the moderator ultimately took.\r\n\r\nWhen you use your close votes, you are one of five users that decided a question isn't a good fit for the site, and for the purposes of transparency and accountability - the question will list those who voted to close it once closed. Transparency is something we really value, it is a cornerstone when it comes to trusting the resources that we provide.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what exactly happened away from the site that you think might have been sparked by your involvement in closing a question. It's obviously not something that we can control, other than [working to make question closings more positive](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/173497/every-close-has-its-thorn-replace-close-with-on-hold-for-the-first-five-d), which we're actively doing. A lot of people mistake 'closed' as some kind of final state when in fact it's not - many questions can be edited to be a great fit and reopened. Taking away some of the angst and sting that comes with a closing will hopefully go a long way toward _not_ frustrating new users that aren't familiar with our system or communities. But, harassment is never okay.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd love for you to do is contact us at `team@stackexchange.com` and provide us with a little more detail regarding the harassment you're seeing. If it's gotten to this point, I suspect it's not exactly trivial, and I'd like to discuss it with you. Feel free to point to this meta post when you contact us, which I hope you'll do."}

We're looking for people that are _passionate_ about this site and its eventual success with the following qualities:\r\n\r\n - Patience and professionalism\r\n - A desire to lead\r\n - A few hours of free time each week that can be spent moderating\r\n - Creative approaches to solving problems the site faces as it grows\r\n - A grasp of most topics asked on the site that is sufficient to allow you to judge the quality of questions and answers that it receives\r\n - Has participated in most aspects of community moderation (editing, closing, reopening, deleting, undeleting, commenting, etc)\r\n\r\nModeration is a _strictly_ volunteer job, you will be in no way obligated to spend time that you don't have to spend on any given day, or any given week. We ask only that you let us know if you're going to be away for more than a week or two, and that you remain reasonably active in your position.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does the job entail, you ask? I'm glad you did. The time that you're able to spend on the site will ideally go into:\r\n\r\n - Handling flags raised by the community, [with the least amount of intervention possible](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/)\r\n\r\n - Participating in Meta discussions and providing support to users that need it from time to time\r\n\r\n - Helping the community with maintenance tasks such as reorganizing tags, merging questions and occasional edits to close reasons or help center pages after a discussion\r\n\r\n - Working on new ways to promote the site and attract the kind of experts and questions the community wants\r\n\r\n - Spending some very enjoyable time with other Stack Exchange moderators from all over the network - the finest bunch of folks you'd ever want to work with. You'll have access to a special chat room where you can go to get support from them.\r\n\r\n - Interfacing directly with us, Stack Exchange to tell us what your community needs and what we might be able to do to help them get it, you'll have our ear.\r\n\r\nThis position is open to any user in good standing that meets the above criteria. If you're interested in stepping up to help this community grow and continue to move forward, please leave an answer to this question indicating your interest and a short overview of why you want the job. \r\n\r\nWhile we're currently looking for one moderator, I'm not opposed to considering two if more than one strong candidate emerges. If you think you'd enjoy the job and do it well, I strongly encourage you to nominate!\r\n\r\nBest of luck, and we'll be in touch with folks after most have had time to read this, and decide if they'd like to step up. \r\n\r\n"}

For the sake of this question, let's define this as businesses that may be illegal in some parts of the world, or that while perhaps not illegal, many people would consider unethical or immoral.\r\n\r\nSome examples might include the adult entertainment world, drug dealing, or perhaps even just a startup whose business model involves highly questionable activities.\r\n\r\nIn practice, I've seen these questions/answers get punished with down votes and harsh comments, so perhaps we've already subconsciously made a decision here. **So my question is, what do we do about these types of shady questions?**\r\n\r\n* Should they just get closed?\r\n\r\n* If there's a question that is questionable  (no pun intended) but could be edited to still ask the underlying question while removing discussion about the aforementioned shady business, should that be done? \r\n\r\n* If it's about a shady business tactic, should we answer it and tell them it's a bad idea?\r\n\r\n* Should I just relax, and let them be? (I.e., we allow these types of questions, as long as they're still startup related?)\r\n\r\nAlong a related note, and what made me think to ask the question, **what if a question or answer is mostly fine, but has a point or two that goes into this territory?** [This answer][1] is what got me thinking about this. It's a good answer to the question, but in the middle is that link to an adult themed website. It's not link spam or anything (at least, I really don't think it is), but my gut reaction was to edit it out and leave the rest of the question alone. \r\n\r\nBut then I started second guessing myself. I don't want to just go edit posts because something didn't completely jive with my own personal ethics, but at the same time, it still feels odd for our site to be linking to a site like that.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/1424/sales-for-my-startup-job-portal/2975#2975"}

We don't have any hard rules on this, and I think how we treat the question will depend on the intent of the OP and how far it goes into the illegal/shady territory. Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n- The problem we'll run into is that some activities are illegal in some jurisdictions, but not others. So it's hard to say we're going to close all questions on X, if X is legal in certain jurisdictions (e.g. gambling sites). That said, there are certain things that while legal in certain parts of the world, are repulsive to most people. I think we can go ahead and close those questions.\r\n\r\n- I think questions with the sole purpose of asking for advice on breaking the law should be closed. For example, \"I'm located in jurisdiction X, where it is illegal to do Y. How can I do Y without getting caught?\"\r\n\r\n- There are some questions that are a little more grey. Or where the OP is unsure about something and is looking to answer \"is X legal?\" In these cases we'll have to use our judgement to determine if the question is asked in good faith, or if the intent is to figure out a way to break the law. If the question seems to be in good faith, I would tend to leave it open, and if necessary, edit it so that the tone clearly reflects that.\r\n\r\n- Questions that are of a pure legal nature and don't apply to the general audience of people starting or running a new business should be closed, regardless of whether the activity is legal or illegal.\r\n\r\n- I'm not opposed to mentions of adult entertainment as long as it is done in good taste and is within the scope of this site. Off-topic, too broad, etc. questions will be closed regardless. With respect to the post you mention in your question, I think it's fine. It is included with several other examples and is used to provide context to his answer. That said, I didn't click on the link. If the destination site bombards you with images of naked people, I would consider that to be in poor taste and would edit out the link. \r\n\r\nSorry, I realize I probably left you just as unsure as you were. But I don't think we can come up with a hard rule on this. I think we'll have to take each question on a case by case basis, and the decisions will be less binary and more gut feeling and opinion based. I will answer one of your questions directly:\r\n\r\n> If there's a question that is questionable (no pun intended) but could be edited to still ask the underlying question while removing discussion about the aforementioned shady business, should that be done?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nThe one area I struggle with is questions where the OP is obviously asking for help on how to spam people. We tend to get those type of questions every now and then. If the question doesn't cleanly fall under one of our close reasons, I always struggle with what to do. On one hand, I absolutely hate spam and don't want to encourage or help others in that pursuit. On the other hand, if it's a valid question for the site, we can't close it. I usually just downvote those questions.\r\n\r\nSee also http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/610/policy-faq-on-questions-which-allude-to-illegal-activity\r\n"}

(Example: http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/51323/)\r\n\r\n**Is this kind of question the kind of thing we want to keep open?**\r\n\r\nSome things to consider:\r\n\r\n1. On one hand, there's probably a definitive answer to these questions. The company itself knows it exactly. (One would hope.) So it's not necessarily subjective or opinion-based, and I don't know if I feel comfortable closing the question on those grounds.\r\n\r\n  But on the other hand, **that company isn't likely to be here to answer the question definitively**, so even though it has a correct answer, the answers that are likely to come up *are* going to be opinion-based--a guess at what the company does.\r\n\r\n2. **Because they're asking about a specific company, would this be \"too localized\"?** How many other people will this question be useful to if we leave it open?\r\n\r\n3. To further complicate the matter, these questions usually reference an established company. The business model of an established company may not apply to a small startup. Thinking along these lines, **this question could be closed on the grounds of being off-topic** (not about startups).\r\n\r\n4. As a follow up to #3, thinking along broader lines, answers to these questions may be misleading. Just because company X does activity Y and has success, doesn't mean that company A would be successful doing Y as well. It doesn't even mean company X has success as a result of doing Y.\r\n\r\n  **It really feels like the user is unwittingly asking the wrong question**. Should we simply vote to close, and help them sort through things to find what their real question is, and tell them to ask that instead?\r\n\r\n5. In my opinion, it feels like these are not good questions, but I'm not sure any of the existing close reasons cover it very well. **Would it be meaningful to have another specialized close option for things like this?** Perhaps something like, \"Asking how a specific other company makes money or functions is not a good fit for this site. Please edit your question to focus on the specific problem your startup is trying to solve instead.\"? (I haven't thought that through very well... that's just a stab in the dark.)\r\n\r\n**TL;DR: Should we allow these questions, and if not, what reasoning should be given for closing them?**"}

Unfortunately, our chat doesn't get used much.\r\n\r\nUnder the old close reasons, this question would have been closed under the \"not constructive\" close reason. Under the new close reasons, it translates to the \"primarily opinion-based\" close option.\r\n\r\nSE recently revamped their close reasons and removed \"too localized\" as an option altogther, because apparently it was being abused on some of the bigger SE sites. However, it makes sense for some questions, like this one. I've found myself wishing \"too localized\" still existed on a couple of occasions. \r\n\r\nWe are allowed some wiggle room in interpreting the general SE rules to best fit our site. There may be a handful of exceptions, but in general SE sites don't allow these type of questions. What I've found is that in the early days of a site folks tend to be more lenient, and allow questions that they probably should close. As the site matures, they become more strict. Some sites have started by allowing polls in the beginning, but later on close them. Questions that were asked early on will get lost and remain open, while new questions are closed. That's why you may find these type of questions lurking on some sites even though they are not allowed. \r\n\r\nThis is the situation we are in. We started by allowing polls, but don't anymore. If you look hard enough, I'm sure you will find some poll type questions that are still open on our site from our early days. We close them as we stumble upon them. We even have a [tag:recommendations] tag that I've been trying to get rid of for forever. So just because we may find these type of questions on other SE sites, and even some tags that give the appearance they are accepted, it doesn't mean that they really are."}

It aims at addressing the absence of a visa category for entrepreneurs raising outside funding.\r\n\r\nThe [tag:visa] tag is meant for general visa questions not specifically related to the Startup Visa. The question is, should questions not specifically related to the Startup Visa be allowed? I took a real quick glance at a few of the questions tagged [tag:visa]. In general they seem on-topic, although I would say that most of them require an immigration lawyer to answer properly, which we don't have on this site.\r\n\r\nSo, I wouldn't merge the two tags because they are sufficiently different.

What sets this site apart from the rest is something quite unique: it's changed hands, or rather changed communities over the course of the last year and a half. The site remains as it was initially defined, but has an almost completely new group of people using it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while many people continue to use the site, the actual _community_ has become quite small. \r\n\r\nThe last [community self-evaluation][1] validated some concerns that we've had for some time now, the quality of questions that the site receives has diminished, along with the number of people taking ownership of this community and the content it serves. We suspect it is because of this that we're losing interest from established users, and not successfully engaging new users that arrive and begin to participate. To put this in context:\r\n\r\n - 264 out of 387 users at the 150 to 199 reputation level (68%) have been gone for 180+ days\r\n - 72 out of 132 users at the 500 to 1000 reputation level (55%) have been gone for 180+ days \r\n - 2 out of 6 10k+ users (33%) have been gone for 180+ days\r\n\r\nThese numbers continue to plummet, leaving the burden of community self-moderation on just a few. We don't track how long it's been since someone visited the site past 180 days, as experience has taught us that they're basically gone at that point.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work, care and dedication that the Answers OnStartups [moderation team][2] has put into this site can not be overstated, and we _do_ see their efforts paying off to a degree, but we've not been able to really engage new and many existing users with the idea of _joining a community_ in addition to asking questions.\r\n\r\n###What is going to happen now?\r\n\r\nGiven that there is still a small core of enthused users that want this community and resource to thrive, we think that the best thing to do at this point is to put the topic back through the [Area 51][3] process in order to ensure that we have the critical mass of people needed to make this site successful.\r\n\r\nWe'll be closing answers.onstartups.com on Tuesday, November 12, 2013. This leaves _ample_ time for this community to [propose the topic again][4] at Area 51, and link to it here so that all interested can find it easily.\r\n\r\nFeel free to take additional advantage of this time by identifying discussions that need to take place on a new proposal. For instance\u2026\r\n\r\n- ...Where should the line between questions about general or small business administration and questions about a start-up business be drawn? \r\n- ...When does *How do I market my new web service?* fall into the on or off-topic category?\r\n\r\n\u2026 all questions that really need consensus from an interested _community_ before the site is ready to launch.\r\n\r\nLaunching a successful Q&A site in a subset of a much larger topic can be difficult _unless_ you\u2019ve got a large enough community committed to making it work, and that\u2019s what this topic needs. We encourage you to try again, and invite experts that you know into the formation of a _new_, _better_ and _much more focused_ resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/1042/lets-get-critical-sep-2013-site-self-evaluation\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users?tab=moderators\r\n  [3]: http://area51.stackexchange.com\r\n  [4]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/create?category=business\r\n"}

If the decision to close the site down is final, and there's no room for negotiation (and I'd say it probably is) then this question and this answer are moot. But I don't really care. Since the site is still open for the time being, I'm going to climb up on the soap box and say my piece.\r\n\r\n## Presume There Exists a Place for a Startups-Based Stack Exchange\r\n\r\nThere is a broader question here that I'm not going to directly answer. That question is, \"Is there room on the Stack Exchange network and within the overall constraints of Stack Exchange for a Q&A site about startups?\" I think that's a discussion worth having, but it's not what I'm trying to get at with this question. So I want to start off by simply making the presumption that there is value in a startups-related Stack Exchange.\r\n\r\n## Presume That This Isn't Quite It\r\n\r\nThis site has been incredibly helpful to me over the years. But there are some problems with the site as it stands. I think we've all felt and seen it. Definitely, the fact that the SE Admins are in the process of shutting things down should be a strong sign that this is the case. So let's also make the assumption that this site is broken in at least one meaningful way. We could make a list, but that's beyond the scope of this question.\r\n\r\n## The <strike>Three</strike> Two Paths Forward\r\n\r\nAs I see it, there are three pathways forward, given the assumption that what we're trying to do here *could* work, but *isn't*:\r\n\r\n1. **Continue on as we have in the past.** This is what we've been doing for a while. Months at least, if not years. We're not growing. We've stalled. It's been the easy choice in the past, I assume because no one actually wants to shut things down, but also because nobody was entirely willing to try to make the radical changes that are needed to fix things. Of course, this option is now off the table, because of the looming site shut down.\r\n\r\n2. **Reboot the site through Area 51.** This second option is to pull the plug on things here, and push the site back through Area 51 to allow things to be redefined, users to recommit, and then to start from scratch. (I assume we could reseed the site with some of the questions and answers from here.) This is what the SE Admins are currently aiming for.\r\n\r\n3. **\"Refactor\" the current site into the site it should be.** This final pathway would be to put in effort (by lots of people in the community, probably over months) to gradually make changes to the site to try to put it on a course that will get it to the desired destination.\r\n\r\n## Why I Think Refactoring is Better Than Rebooting\r\n\r\nI'm a strong supporter of going with option #3, to refactor instead of reboot. Here are my reasons:\r\n\r\n1. **Rebooting means losing a lot of the current community.** I've seen some people express interest in continuing to support this site, even if it goes back to Area 51. But there is little doubt that we'll lose a lot of people. It's the demotivation factor. People working on startups have little time to dedicate to helping people. If you take their efforts and trash them, many people will leave and find their own ways to help others.\r\n\r\n  As an example, the [initial 3D modeling proposal][1] on Area 51 had enough support to get to a private beta where it was declared dead, and sent back to start. The second iteration, under the name \"CG Artists\" was slower to gain popularity. It hit a year in the definition phase and was very close to enough users and enough questions to advance, but the year elapsed and it was closed as well. This Round #2 was actually weaker than Round #1. It lost support in the reboot. It's now on [Round #3][2]. It's three months into it, and it only has 6 followers. It's most certainly not going to make it in the end. Again, more lost support. The people who are interested in these sites lose their motivation to keep pushing it forward when it goes through a reboot.\r\n\r\n2. **Rebooting means lost down time.** We get lots of... um... how do I say this gently... less useful questions here. But we also got lots of great questions. There will be time that the proposal sits in Area 51 that we aren't going to be able to help people like we want to. Likely months, not days. They'll find other communities to get their answers instead. So we potentially lose these people forever.\r\n\r\n3. **You can't make the assumption that what you build the second time will be better than the first.** This site, problems and all, is what it is because of the growth and learning process that has happened over years of time. Some of the problems we have are there because we learned that doing it differently causes bigger problems. Going through a reboot, we're likely to make many, if not all of the same mistakes as we did this time. Especially if we've lost some of our most active members from point #1.\r\n\r\n4. **We're in better shape to get to our destination starting from where we're at, than from scratch.** If you haven't read it before, go read what Joel Spolsky, the CEO of Stack Exchange said [you should never do: trash something and start over][3]. Sure, we have a long way to go, and I can understand why it might feel nice to start from a clean slate. But despite the problems, we have a lot going for us as well. I think we'd be fools to throw that away without at least first *attempting* an in-place fix.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5022/\r\n  [2]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/59088/\r\n  [3]: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"}

With Stackoverflow, answers are binary: the code either works or it doesn't.

(And I think that behavior is at the core of what's wrong with this site.) So, thanks for stepping up!\r\n\r\nI agree with you that refactoring the site is a much better approach than shutting it down and forcing it to go through Area 51. Let's assume that we've convinced the powers that be that this is the best path forward for OnStartups, now what?\r\n\r\nObviously, the site can't continue to operate like it has for the last year and a half or so. It's just not working. I'm a believer that this site has to undergo a drastic change, but I think that if we try to tackle all of the issues at the same time, it's going to be too much for the handful of folks actively participating. I think we need to discuss the issues and take each one at a time.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest problem with the site is that there is no community. Everyone wants a destination they can go to for their startup related questions, but nobody wants to put the effort into maintaining a **quality** site. This is a hard problem to solve and one that's not going to be solved overnight. My hope is that if we fix some of the other issues with the site, in time this issue will work itself out.\r\n\r\n**I propose that as a first step we get together as a community and define the scope of this site.** One of the issues we face is that we never actually went through the exercise of defining our site, so everyone has their own opinion of what is a startup question. What is a startup for the purpose of this site? Is it strictly high-tech companies? Freelancers? Small businesses? Without a common definition it's hard for us to come together as a community. [This question was asked once before][1], but instead of getting a discussion going, it garnered some negative and unnecessarily rude comments. I say we give it another try and clearly define our scope. Once we've got that, we can tackle some of the other problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/705/is-onstartups-for-tech-software-businesses-only"}

The _majority_ of our decision to close the site is due to the fact that only _very_ few people are taking on these aspects of the site; that's not healthy and it simply won't scale to the amount of drive-by traffic that the site is currently seeing. \r\n\r\nThe user retention here is quite frankly, for lack of a better word, abysmal. People come and ask their questions which are either closed or answered, then they go on about what they were doing, mostly coming from search engines. Right now:\r\n\r\n - 270 out of 393 users around the 150 rep mark are gone\r\n - 75 out of 133 users around the 500 rep mark are gone\r\n - 5 out of 17 users around the 3k rep mark are gone\r\n - 2 out of 6 users around the 10k rep mark are gone\r\n\r\nThis paints a _very_ troubling picture. The established users we have are leaving in percentages greater than or equal to 1/3 of what we had, and they're not being replenished by new members that find the site and become engaged with the concept of _community_ and more importantly _community moderation_. You can't put this task on the shoulders of just a few, and that's what it has boiled down to - it's simply not a tenable situation, and it's continuing to deteriorate. \r\n\r\nOur decision to put the site back through area 51 was _mostly_ aimed at ensuring that the topic was defined better, _and had a substantial more involved community behind it_. We could talk about the scope of the site, come up with better custom close reasons and tweak our help center articles but _that doesn't work well when we don't have very many users interested in maintaining the site_. Additionally, after 3+ years in beta, the site positively _can't_ sustain a democratic moderator election - there just aren't enough active users to do it.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to get too oddly-specific regarding this when I wrote the post saying that the site was going to close, because those of you that remained _have_ been doing what you could for the site despite overwhelming evidence that it just wasn't working.\r\n\r\nOnly now, after the notice has been posted did we begin _talking about what to talk about_, and there aren't many people at this table. This _could_ be a great site and a great topic, but it's going to need quite a few more people behind it to make it work.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the _community_ taking moderation into their hands, the moderators had to make quite a few unilateral decisions. That's not their fault - and it can't continue. "}

What sets this site apart from the rest is something quite unique: it's changed hands, or rather changed communities over the course of the last year and a half. The site remains as it was initially defined, but has an almost completely new group of people using it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while many people continue to use the site, the actual _community_ has become quite small. \r\n\r\nThe last [community self-evaluation][1] validated some concerns that we've had for some time now, the quality of questions that the site receives has diminished, along with the number of people taking ownership of this community and the content it serves. We suspect it is because of this that we're losing interest from established users, and not successfully engaging new users that arrive and begin to participate. To put this in context:\r\n\r\n - 264 out of 387 users at the 150 to 199 reputation level (68%) have been gone for 180+ days\r\n - 72 out of 132 users at the 500 to 1000 reputation level (55%) have been gone for 180+ days \r\n - 2 out of 6 10k+ users (33%) have been gone for 180+ days\r\n\r\nThese numbers continue to plummet, leaving the burden of community self-moderation on just a few. We don't track how long it's been since someone visited the site past 180 days, as experience has taught us that they're basically gone at that point.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work, care and dedication that the Answers OnStartups [moderation team][2] has put into this site can not be overstated, and we _do_ see their efforts paying off to a degree, but we've not been able to really engage new and many existing users with the idea of _joining a community_ in addition to asking questions.\r\n\r\n###What is going to happen now?\r\n\r\nGiven that there is still a small core of enthused users that want this community and resource to thrive, we think that the best thing to do at this point is to put the topic back through the [Area 51][3] process in order to ensure that we have the critical mass of people needed to make this site successful.\r\n\r\nWe'll be closing answers.onstartups.com on Tuesday, November 12, 2013. This leaves _ample_ time for this community to [propose the topic again][4] at Area 51, and link to it here so that all interested can find it easily.\r\n\r\nFeel free to take additional advantage of this time by identifying discussions that need to take place on a new proposal. For instance\u2026\r\n\r\n- ...Where should the line between questions about general or small business administration and questions about a start-up business be drawn? \r\n- ...When does *How do I market my new web service?* fall into the on or off-topic category?\r\n\r\n\u2026 all questions that really need consensus from an interested _community_ before the site is ready to launch.\r\n\r\nLaunching a successful Q&A site in a subset of a much larger topic can be difficult _unless_ you\u2019ve got a large enough community committed to making it work, and that\u2019s what this topic needs. We encourage you to try again, and invite experts that you know into the formation of a _new_, _better_ and _much more focused_ resource.\r\n\r\n***Update (11/27/13)***\r\n\r\nWe're still working with Dharmesh to make sure that a reboot of the topic is truly the best course of action to take. We're still rather certain that it is, but we want to make sure that we've explored all possibilities prior to doing so. We do sincerely apologize for the confusion that the delay has caused, we just want to make _absolutely_ certain that we're proceeding in the best possible manner.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/1042/lets-get-critical-sep-2013-site-self-evaluation\r\n  [2]: http://answers.onstartups.com/users?tab=moderators\r\n  [3]: http://area51.stackexchange.com\r\n  [4]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/create?category=business\r\n"}

Second, why haven't we started a discussion about this *since* the announcement?**\r\n\r\n**For the former case, I never felt like I had the power or the clout on the site to try to push through real change.** It always felt like something that could have and should have been initiated by somebody with more clout, more reputation, or perhaps just more moderator-y. I couldn't be sure if I was the only one who felt like the site had problems, or if everyone else was seeing it too.\r\n\r\nOf course, once the announcement was made, the rules suddenly changed. If the death of the side was impending, who cares how much clout or reputation you have. But **on this side of that kind of revelation, it's hard to feel *motivated* to start the discussion going.** Heck, it's even hard to want to *participate* in the discussion even if somebody else gets it started. It feels futile. \r\n\r\nWe need to feel like our efforts could pay off before investing in that path forward. In fact, we've *tried* to start this discussion, and when we do, it's not long before the Stack Exchange admins/moderators come along to reiterate that, \"no, the site is still going to be shut down.\" (Let's not confuse the SE admins with the moderators for this specific site, who *do* seem interested in fixing things.)\r\n\r\n**Since the decision, I've been doing what I can to try to fight the battle to allow us some time to try to work things out. For me, that's the battle to win first, before we can start figuring out *how* to change.**\r\n\r\nI, for one, am more than willing to try to get this site working. I've found it fun to be a part of this community, and I feel like I've learned a lot from smart people that I have a lot of respect for. I want that to be around for myself and for other people who try to build their own startups. **If we can convince them to keep the site around on life support for a while longer, I'd be more than happy to help in the rebuilding process.**"}

This assumes, to a degree, that the site still hangs around for us to refactor/cleanup, instead of getting shut down, but it may be relevant even then.\r\n\r\nTrying my best to be an impartial observer, **the problem I see is that there seems to be two emerging sides as to where to go next, and they don't appear to play nice together**.\r\n\r\nOne one hand, you have **the \"Moderator Reductionists\" (yes, it's just a silly name I invented, don't anybody be too offended or anything) that feel the biggest problem here is over-zealous moderation, or perhaps rules that are too restrictive**. For these people, the best way to fix the problem is to relax all of the rules as far as they can reasonably be relaxed, and then tighten them again where we see problems. Their reasoning is that the biggest problem is that we're turning away too many new people by shutting down their questions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you have **the people who say, \"Noobs always ask, 'How does I do the strat up?'\" (again, don't be offended, I'm just trying to be lighthearted.)** For them, the biggest issue is that there are a lot of people who are asking really simple, really basic questions (which they should have just Googled first), or are asking questions with no correct answer. The concern is that there is massive amounts of low quality questions.\r\n\r\nIn all of this, I have a few questions. Feel free to answer any or all of them in your responses.\r\n\r\n1. Does this seem like a fair assessment? Do other people see this happening too, or am I pulling this problem out of thin air?\r\n2. Are these two sides as opposite as it feels?\r\n3.
