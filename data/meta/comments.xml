I don't know why that happened, it could just have been that they got busy with their startups around the same time we merged with SE. But whatever the reason was, it happened. Their active participation kept the quality of the site up. They attracted true entrepreneurs to the site, not these &quot;tell me the secret to success&quot; wannapreneurs we get now."

  <row Id="1440" PostId="1090" Text="2) OnStartups got a lot more visibility and the traffic increased. The problem is that these were the wrong users. One of our users likes to blame the low retention rate to the rules, but that's just not the case. We follow the same rules as the other SE sites, yet we're the one with this problem. Secondly, it doesn't matter whether a new user's question is closed or remains open and is answered. The result is still the same - they leave &amp; never come back. My answer here http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/859 goes into more detail on my opinion on this. The whole thread is worth reading too." CreationDate="2013-11-29T23:53:41.603" UserId="2692" />
  <row Id="1441" PostId="1090" Text="3) The rules changed. IMO, _if_ this is part of the problem, it only accounts for a small portion of the problem. We didn't have these rules when the site first started, but it was a much smaller group. As the site grew, it was necessary to put some rules in place to prevent the site from turning into Yahoo Answers. When we first merged with SE we didn't enforce the SE rules. We started enforcing them **after** the quality of the site went down." CreationDate="2013-11-29T23:56:15.380" UserId="2692" />

  <row Id="1443" PostId="1090" Text="For me, the quality is the #1 issue, but the rules (or format) don't help. I tend to believe that startups are easier to learn by example. How did AirBnB solve the chicken and egg problem? I can learn from that. Answering the general question of &quot;how do I get my first customers&quot; is such a vague and open-ended question, I would have to write a encyclopedia. Quora did a great job of gathering those very specific and very insightful questions. The problem with startup questions is that the answers depend on a lot of context, unlike programming questions."

  <row Id="1444" PostId="1090" Text="@Zuly, Alain, and Liam, one suggestion, assuming the site doesn't get closed, is to adopt the policy of *aggressively* editing anything that is put on hold, even if it risks not being exactly what the asker is looking for. It may be possible to take so-so questions and make them okay/good questions. This could help improve the quality of new questions *and* still make most people happy. At least they'll get some kind of answer and not feel completely shutdown. Also, that's really what the closing/on hold process is all about is coming together to create great content.

  <row Id="1445" PostId="1090" Text="Sure, but that would be a lot of work from the moderators/editors. Last time I was actively editing, we were no more than 5, not enough for this kind of rewrite. But good idea." CreationDate="2013-12-06T03:56:13.253" UserId="502" />

  <row Id="1447" PostId="1096" Text="I guess you'd put me in the second category (noobs). For startup topics (and business topics) as well, I don't think exact answers exist as long as the questions are formulated as &quot;tell me what I should do, my startup problem is...&quot;. As I said before, Quora worked well because they used specific questions (&quot;how did LinkedIn get started&quot;), which have best answers. StackOverflow's pieces of code all have a best solution. We don't. By the way, TheFunded.com had similar problems: the general discussions didn't go very far, but the specific VC ratings were very insightful."
