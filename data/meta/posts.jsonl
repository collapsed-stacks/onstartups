But typically an undeserved down-vote creates an indignation that causes what can be termed as \"pity up-votes.\" Down-voting is often met with an accompanying up-vote, unless the down-vote is truly deserved.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that the occasional random (even undeserved) down-vote can sting a bit. But, as you use the system and gain a bit of reputation, accounting for each and every point becomes less of a concern and you can better enjoy the use of the site. Consider for a moment that, for every undeserved down-vote, you've probably also received the occasional up-vote you didn't deserve either. Remember:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Up-vote = +10 points</li>\n<li>Down-vote = -2 points</li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": 4255, "LastEditorUserId": 4255, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-14T16:48:26.930", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-14T16:48:26.930", "CommentCount": 1}

The lack of voting has been an issue with this site for a while. I have yet to figure out why people don't upvote. I don't think it has anything to do with being #1, but I could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I think it's a lot more important to upvote new users than it is to upvote us oldtimers with high rep. Upvoting new users will hopefully encourage them to stick around. It will also let them reach important rep milestones that will allow them to help keep the community organized (e.g. editing, retagging, voting to close/open questions). So I would hope, and encourage, people to upvote the newbies more than those on the first page.</p>\n\n<p>I think it boils down to different people having different philosophies on voting. Why our site tends to have a lower rate of voting than other SE sites, I don't know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The best thing you can do is lead by example.</strong> Upvote as you see fit, and hopefully others will follow. Also leave comments when appropriate.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and only 3 (!!!) people have earned the sportsmanship badge for consistent upvoting competing answers. (Really, none of the other answers to the questions you answered added significant value?) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Something to keep in mind about the sportsmanship badge is that it is awarded when you upvote <strong>100</strong> competing answers. I would imagine that a lot of people have upvoted competing answers, but upvoting <strong>100</strong> competing answers is not necessarily an easy task. I, myself, have upvoted several competing answers, but I haven't been able to reach the 100 mark yet. At one point I even went back to some of my old answers looking for competing answers I could upvote just so I could get the badge ;-)</p>\n\n<p><em>Here's what makes getting this badge a challenge:</em> When I see a question I am able to answer, if the question already has answers, I read the answers first before posting an answer of my own. If I find that the posted answers address the question, then I upvote the answers, and move on. There's no point in answering the question if there is nothing for me to add. If however, I find that the already posted answers don't address the question adequately, or if I think there is something else I can add to the discussion, then I post an answer of my own. In this case, if the current answers don't address the question adequately it makes it harder for me to upvote them. It's not to say that it's impossible, but the opportunities for this are limited.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of this is that there are times that people get so carried away answering a question that they forget to upvote altogether (including the question itself). This has happened to me on several occasions.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastEditorUserId": 2692, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-09T18:14:16.527", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-09T18:14:16.527", "CommentCount": 1}

It's that virtual guarantee of sustained, future success that indicates when it is time to graduate.</p>\n\n<p>OnStartups isn't <em>quite</em> there, yet.</p>\n\n<p>I say <strong>\"quite\"</strong> because, in recent weeks, there have been some promising signs of more substantial growth. Those periodic up-ticks in traffic followed by small-but-sustained increases is promising. That means you are retaining users once they find the site. But more users and more traffic means we really <em>should</em> be seeing on-going, <em>steady</em> growth&hellip; and we're not quite seeing that, yet.</p>\n\n<p>On a more subjective note, there seems to be a disproportionately small group of \"prolific <em>EXPERT</em> users\" who assure that the site continues to provide top-quality content. There are simply fewer users in that <em>core group</em> than we like to see. That leaves the site vulnerable to decline, should a few users decide to leave. </p>\n\n<p>But the overall quality of new questions <em>HAS</em> gotten notably better over the past several weeks. If this move-to-quality continues and new users keep finding the site, OnStartups should graduate soon. <strong>Quality is job-one at this stage</strong>; much more important than asking <em>lots</em> of questions. </p>\n\n<p>Rigorous community self-moderation is key to sustaining and promoting that quality. This site can use a burst of community cleanup activity to clear out the old cruft cluttering up the darker corners of this site. </p>\n\n<p>When those top questions appear on your site, you can attract new users by highlighting your most intriguing questions.  Use those social bookmarks!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/puZgD.png\" alt=\"Social Bookmarks\"></p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 4255, "LastEditorUserId": 4255, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-27T17:47:43.267", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-27T17:47:43.267", "CommentCount": 2}

Here are a few of mine:</p>\n\n<p>Badges/Buttons-The badges here are used internally to this site (which is fine) but you could implement a public badge creator that enables people to embed an OnStartups Answers badge/button on their blog or website that links to this site. This would be similar to the many <a href=\"http://www.twitterbuttons.com/twitter-badges.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter button creators</a>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Email Newsletter- Although many people use RSS feeds, some people prefer to subscribe to forums via email and receive a weekly or monthly round-up of top questions and answers. This is a great way for people to opt-in to receive information (even if they don't register with the Answers site), and emails are often forwarded to others. To increase email subscriptions, or just offer on its own without registration form if you want to take a more viral approach, offer a relevant, useful eBook, video, or other type of content that they immediately receive. This content should be optimized to be shared via social media, furthering its reach.</p>\n\n<p>Video Campaign- Create a series (start with one video, test it, analyze results, create second video, and so on) of short videos and post to YouTube and the OnStartups blog. Include a strong call-to-action, for example the \"Google inbound marketing\" CTA that HubSpot used in <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/4437/You-Oughta-Know-Inbound-Marketing.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">You Oughta Know Inbound Marketing\"</a> video.</p>\n\n<p>SEO Press Release-Simple, short press release announcing two successful software entrepreneurs started free community to help other startups. Do some keyword research and be sure to include keywords in release and provide link to Answers site. <a href=\"http://www.prlog.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">PRLog</a> is my preferred free or low-cost release distribution site.</p>\n\n<p>Contest- The person that submits a question that gets the most community votes during a specific month, and the person that has the top answer during that specific month, each receive a free 1 hour conference call with you and Dharmesh to receive valuable advice on their most challenging problems. Since only active community users with high enough internal badges can vote, this would prevent cheating.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-02-10T06:27:39.047", "CommentCount": 1}

Thank you for your voting. I have enjoyed watching your engagement over the last 10 days.</p>\n\n<p>I am also new -- about 40-ish days or something -- I would have to go check to be exact.

(there are some exceptions, see my comments below)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Things to Consider</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Based on my \"look\" at the other sites and a quick comparison -- the percentage of voting/views is about the same as on the other sites. The number of views on this site is simply significantly lower. This is not because of a lower number of registered users -- but a lower percetange of active users that are viewing the questions. </li>\n<li>There are relatively few active users with moderation privileged. There are two type -- the chosen moderators, and those that have earned limited moderating privileged. Of those that are active-- I have found them to be very diligent on the issues that you mention like closing off-topic questions. (The lack of transparency around these processes do make that engagement difficult to assess) I have also found that they (we) are sensitive to not \"shutting down\" new members for slightly off topic questions in order to encourage them to improve and remain engaged with the site. (For example <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/q/24295/8791\">this</a> one that you questioned this morning that lots of people really enjoyed.) One of the challenges is that most of the theresholds (for \"closing\" for example) by moderators with earned privileges have been set up system-wide and do not seem to be indexed according to the specific site activity. </li>\n<li>There is very poor community member retention. While there is/was an extenuating circumstance (see below) the poor level of participation by the moderators and reputation leaders in the site, as well as the sharp drop off after a certin point of these folks seems to have had a significant negative impact on the sites ability to mature. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Extenuating Circumstances</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am sure you see lots of \"answers\" to questions on this \"meta\" site referencing both the beta nature of the site, as well as the fact that it is a transfer from another site model which was determined not to work. This answer is used as an explanation to the general poor level of development of the community. </p>\n\n<p>It also seems to me to be an excuse. The site is a beta. It is migrated from another model. And all of the issues you identified are still true and still should be proactively addressed. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My Experience</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have found that -- in contrast to other online communities of which I am part -- the challenge of OnStartups (perhaps the Stack's model) are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of transparency by the \"owners/leaders\" of the site </li>\n<li>Lack of delegation of responsibilities </li>\n<li>Lack of direct member-member communications</li>\n<li>Lack of discernible plan to build or grow the community  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>So what's the answer?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The general precept of the site is that it is a member driven community. (Whether or not it really is an authentically member driven site is a separate discussion I suppose) <strong>Within that context the responsibility to make it what we want or hope it could/should/would be rests with us</strong>. As individuals. Taking the baby steps needed. </p>\n\n<p>The best way to improve the quality of questions -- is to ask high quality questions. i see that you have asked a great question about selling investors. It did not get any answers or votes. My experience is that folks like questions that are very specific rather than general. I bet if you were to have asked that question to be very specific to a situation you were facing right now there would have been lots of answers and votes. (Well, its for this site-- which will be between 5-7 votes!)</p>\n\n<p>The best way to increase voting -- is to increase your number of votes. Go back to old questions and answers and find ones that you like. I see that you have been active voting in your first ten days (an average of 4.5 or so a day is more than the average bear) If more of us do this the positive feedback will encourage more involvement. We can increase the level of discernment on \"quality\" as the activity improves. If you \"write off\" questions with only 1-2 votes as being suspect with acknowledgement of the low voting, then you might be missing some great questions that your experience could add a great answer. Even if it is an old question, your answer will move it back into the active list and reintroduce it to people who might have missed it.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to reach out directly to lots of members. following up with their questions. Offering to review marketing decks or read executive summaries. I have become friends with several site members and am learning much from their experience. It is unfortunate that the site does not encourage or really support that level of community building. But for folks that do fill out their profile to include a site, that has a link for emailing/im-ing or the like -- it is possible to reach out. </p>\n\n<p>I am still trying to figure out how to engage the site members in the development of a real plan which would include delegation of responsibilities, proactively engage new members, reach out to targeted folks that we want to join us -- and all of the other great things that should/could be done. </p>\n\n<p><em>Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.</em> </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 8791, "LastActivityDate": "2011-05-02T18:22:58.823", "CommentCount": 2}

Because of that, I encourage our more experienced members to leave these new users feedback on what they can do to improve their question/answer - <em>I think you've done a particularly good job of this.</em></p>\n\n<p>The software could make it eaiser to leave a comment, maybe by popping up a box if you perform a certain action (although this can get annoying). This already happens in some cases, so it shouldn't be too difficult to expand, but <strong>I think we can work with what we currently have to improve new users' experience.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why remain anonymous?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well because not everyone is as mature as most of us - this is the internet afterall. Some people will actually get mad, and try to get revenge. I know that sounds silly, immature, and unprofessional, but believe it or not, it happens. To give you an example, a few weeks ago, I closed a question as off-topic. The poster got mad, and left a couple of nasty comments about me, and then downvoted two of my questions. That's extremely childish, but those people exist, so I can understand why some people may want to remain anonymous in certain situations. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I found this <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/135/encouraging-people-to-explain-down-votes\">related thread</a> on meta.SO discussing the pros and cons of this approach.

Those questions are designed to elicit opinions and discussions, not to find the right answer. I know we have a lot of subjective questions on this site, and that's fine with me, because that's the nature of the startups topic. However, I feel like the \"review my ...\" questions go way beyond simply being subjective, and can only be strictly discussion questions.</li>\n<li>These questions lead to lots of spam. I'm sure there are plenty of folks out there that are truly interested in getting feedback on how to improve their product/website/etc (I'm one of them). The problem is that there are probably way more people out there that are simply interested in posting a link to their site to get traffic, and never plan on contributing to the site. I consider this to be spam, and it is very annoying to those of us that put so much effort into building this site.</li>\n<li>If we ignore the above two points, and decide to allow these questions, my feeling is that we'll end up getting overrun with them. That's all we'll end up seeing on the main page, and as a result we'll end up pushing away the few experts left on this site. These types of questions are generally not interesting, and for the most part only benefit the person asking the question.

You're a gem, really.</p>\n\n<p>About what to do ... honestly, I don't know, and I despair at it.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I feel that Answers.Onstartups (AO) is drowning in low-quality questions. And my motivation to contribute answers is falling, hard.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the problem is easily Google-able questions, but that's not the only problem. There is at least one important problem more: The Stack Exchange (SE) engine was built to avoid duplicates of the same question. But it was built on programming questions, which often have a narrow vocabulary; a specific set of words are set by the professional vernacular.</p>\n\n<p>AO deals with 'business' issues and 'human' issues, and the list of more-or-less synonym words that can be used is huge. We're seeing lots of fairly similar questions being asked again and again, and the SE engine isn't successfully stopping this. (To be fair, 'reading the users mind' is the very hardest problem there is in computer science!) (And before someone reminds me of the Close -> Exact Duplicate function, I just used it a few seconds ago.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Back to easily Google-able questions:</strong> Actually my first instinct is to go easy on them. They can work as Google-fodder, providing link bait which lures in other prospective entrepreneurs and helps grow this site.</p>\n\n<p>But, this should be handled in context of how the site is currently doing. My personal view is that while many things are steadily improving, we are currently loosing a vital battle over the signal-to-noise ratio. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old-timer, but that's how I feel.</p>\n\n<p>So, while I think that easily Google-able questions are essentially an asset, I would be all in favor of going hash on them until the community moderation is stronger. My main focus is that I'd like a stronger community moderation here.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 1261, "LastActivityDate": "2011-07-04T23:23:32.087", "CommentCount": 6}

Sorry for the long post.]</p>\n\n<p>If you want to keep your job and work on a side online business, go for it. I did it and I am planning to do it again.. and again (note: this will not be a marketing pitch!)</p>\n\n<p>I follow and read a lot about startups. I listen to <a href=\"http://thisweekninstartups.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">thisweekninstartups.com</a> &amp;  and read Hacker News plus others. I read books like \"Founders at Work\". I am web a developer and have a full time job. Always have been. After listening to all the stories about startups, I get the sense that if you want to launch a successful startup, you MUST dedicate all your time and energy to it.</p>\n\n<p>I started a web hosting company over 10 years ago and it was very successful. I paid for everything from my own pocket. No funding of any kind, not even borrowing or taking a loan. I started with a single server and kept adding more hardware with more traffic, organically. I have no employees and I didn't pay myself. I had a day job. The web hosting was a one man shop and I did EVERYTHING; hardware and software support, billing and marketing. ALL THIS WHILE KEEPING MY DAY JOB! Yes it was hard work and nerve wrecking when a server would go down. I was nervous and tense whenever I traveled because I was in a \"what will I do if a server goes down or I need to be there to replace some hardware\" mode.\nI built the systems myself. My ISP has no idea and all they can do is push the reset or power buttons. </p>\n\n<p>However I gave great customer support. I would answer business calls during work, secretly.. oops! Business mail would forward to my phone. That's the only way to juggle between a day job and have a side business AND offer fast customer support. But it worked for YEARS and minus the hosting fee I paid my ISP, almost all my revenue was pure profit. It was nice, minus some stress.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I got married and had kids and got very busy. It affected my business. I was giving it less time and my customers felt it and they started moving to other hosting companies and I neglected all kinds of marketing so eventually I was bleeding customers. Customers left with no new customers signing up. I decided my family came first. The only time I could do any work was when everyone went to bed and I would stay up, coding and coding.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of the web is that if you go to a web site offering a service, you have no idea if one person is behind it or a group of people. I used that to my advantage. As long as your web site looks professional and you offer a reliable affordable useful service, <strong>you are in business!</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that a lot of people are afraid to start a startup and to quit their day job. They don't want to lose the security of a dependable salary and the benefits like health insurance. If you have kids and a mortgage, it would be frightening to lose all that. Some take the leap and some people don't. I didn't. BUT what if you can just make both happen? A secure day job AND and a profitable online business.</p>\n\n<p>My web hosting is dying now. That's OK and I understand. The business became a commodity and there are tons of companies offering free hosting, 59 cents hosting and other crazy figures. I can probably do the same and still be profitable but I think I had enough and I need a change.</p>\n\n<p>Guess what? I am still planning to keep my day job and I have THREE ideas for startups. I am very excited about them and each one can keep me busy for YEARS. I am on fire and I am full of energy to work on the first one. Because I am a web developer, I can build them myself. I can host them myself because I already have hosting experience. I know developing them myself might be too much for me so maybe I will outsource some work using services like rentacoder.com or eLance.com and be in charge because they are my ideas, I know how they should be built and I have the specs.</p>\n\n<p>If an idea fails as a business, that's OK too. Because it will be a great learning experience from a technical side for me. I am a Windows developer. I want to learn WPF, Silverlight, MVC, .NET 4.0, WCF, JQuery.. and the rest of the latest coming out from the technical firehose. What's better than learning these cutting edge technologies, be proficient in them and build a concrete application that the whole world will use. You can put these in your resume and be more marketable. Remember.. I have a day job and want to be more marketable and earn more because I have practical modern skills.</p>\n\n<p>So here's my final word, which I mentioned in the beginning, if you want to keep your job and work on a side online business, go for it. I did it and I am planning to do it again.. and again. If you are going to do it yourself, it will take A LOT of work. To make it happen faster, you will need to focus, have a cutting sharp concentration, adaptable, resourceful, flexible, manage your time with a determination, be able to cut the noise from the web (tweets, facebook, blogs, emails.. etc). Learn.. learn.. learn. I read a lot every day just trying to keep up with all the new technologies. When I code and I need help, I Google. If it looks like it will take me more than 5-10 minutes (I do my homework) to find an answer, I post a question on stackoverflow.com. SO is a great resource. Ask for help, don't spin your wheels.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>[I know people will ask. Sorry I can't name my company nor mention my new ideas]</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2590, "LastEditorUserId": 2692, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-07-06T02:21:12.370", "LastActivityDate": "2011-07-06T02:21:12.370", "Title": "YES... you can build a profitable startup while keeping your day job", "Tags": ["discussion", "motivation"], "AnswerCount": 5, "FavoriteCount": 1}

So OnStartups attracts the bad as well as the good.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr version:</p>\n\n<p>OnStartups exists primarily because there is high current interest in the tech startup phenomenon, driven by publicity about social networking, \"4 hour work weeks\", VCs, and technology IPOs. </p>\n\n<p>The startup scene today resembles the dot com bubble of 1997-2000 but much smaller and with less free cash floating around. </p>\n\n<p>And, there is a high unemployment rate, and many younger technology people, especially those just graduated, may be having difficulty finding traditional employment. </p>\n\n<p>The point I am making is that there is a great amount of \"effervescence\" of the startup scene - lots of people dabbling in it. You have people today who believe that they are attempting to create a new business who do not have the first clue about the landscape of self employment or business creation. </p>\n\n<p>In a different period in history with more affluence, say 5 years ago, a startup is the last thing that many startup \"founders\" would have considered. They would be working in an entry level job.</p>\n\n<p>So they come to OnStartups -drawn by the board's subject matter - and their questions tend to reflect an extreme \"newbie\" sensibility. </p>\n\n<p>It's all about them and their needs, and they don't tend to be terribly appreciative of truly realistic advice that is provided. </p>\n\n<p>That's my theory, anyway. I have had what I consider decent (and realistic) answers to fundamental questions blown off as \"too critical\" or too harsh. After a few of these I won't even participate in subjects that have a whiff of naivete'. It's not worth my time.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully the relatively few who do have meaty questions can buoy up the quality here. </p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-09-18T01:02:37.363"}

So different. And it's so important that you get that.</p>\n\n<p>We, as start-up entrepreneurs, are <strong>clueless</strong> until we learn about something.

Our goal is to reduce the number of unanswered questions by taking several actions. </p>\n\n<p>Currently there are a total of 384 <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered\">unanswered questions</a>, with 198 of those having <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers\">no answers</a>. Some of these unanswered questions will be off-topic or low quality questions that should be closed. Others will be good questions that have been missed somehow. And others will be good questions that require an expertise we\u2019re currently lacking on the site.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>You do not have to act on all 384 unanswered questions; only what you feel comfortable with.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Go through the list of <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/unanswered\">unanswered questions</a> at your leisure, and perform any of the following actions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Answer the questions you can answer.</li>\n<li>Upvote <strong>good</strong> answers. <em>Please don\u2019t go crazy upvoting stuff you normally wouldn\u2019t.</em> Stick to only upvoting good posts.</li>\n<li>If it\u2019s a good question, and you know someone outside of the community that has the expertise to answer the question, share it. For example, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. </li>\n<li>Edit those questions that can be improved.</li>\n<li>If a question is unclear, leave a comment asking for clarification.</li>\n<li>If the question is off-topic or otherwise not a good fit for the site, vote to close and/or downvote. And leave a comment if you feel inclined to do so.</li>\n<li>Vote to delete some questions.<strong>*</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Questions that have been around for a while with no answers are candidates for deletion, even if it\u2019s <a href=\"http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/537\">not a terrible question</a>. And obviously really bad threads should also be deleted.</p>\n\n<p>For those questions you feel should be closed or deleted, leave a link to them in the answer below under the appropriate category. The reason for doing so is that we have 384 unanswered questions, and the odds of everyone going through all 384 questions is close to zero. By leaving the links below it makes it easier for people to find these questions.</p>\n\n<p>Doing it this way also opens up the contest to more people. Note that you need 4000 rep to have the ability to vote to delete. If you have less than 4000 rep and spot a question that you think should be deleted, leave a note in the answer below next to the question\u2019s link.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Points</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are not looking to end phase 2 with 0 unanswered questions; we simply want to reduce the number of unanswered questions. The most important aspect is to answer good questions that have been missed, and close and delete the really bad questions.</p>\n\n<p>This phase will last 1 week, starting today and ending on January 29. On January 30 we will move on to phase 3.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastEditorUserId": 2692, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2012-02-06T18:42:57.400", "LastActivityDate": "2012-02-24T00:25:08.373", "Title": "Clean-up contest - Phase 2", "Tags": ["discussion", "contest"], "AnswerCount": 1}

Pick a question from the list, and perform one of the following actions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the question has already been closed or deleted, delete the link from the list. </li>\n<li>If it is a valid on-topic question, delete the link from the list. </li>\n<li>If the question is off-topic, vote to close and leave the link in the list for others to find.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This phase will last 1 week, starting today and ending on February 26. At the end of this phase all the links should have been deleted from the answer. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>You need a minimum of 500 rep to have the ability to vote to close questions. For those that have less than 500 rep, you can still participate by leaving comments if you feel a question should be closed as off-topic, and by removing the already closed and deleted threads from the list in the answer below. Removing the closed/deleted threads from the list is actually quite helpful because it helps the higher rep users concentrate on the open questions.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastEditorUserId": 2692, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2012-03-19T05:18:47.727", "LastActivityDate": "2012-05-15T06:33:40.793", "Title": "Clean-up contest - Phase 5", "Tags": ["discussion", "contest"], "AnswerCount": 1, "CommentCount": 0}

There's really not a whole lot we can do about the first group, other than help them understand how the site works. And in most cases these seem to be one off.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To answer your question</strong>, I don't see anything wrong with downvoting answers to off-topic questions, even if it is a good answer. I've thought about doing the same thing myself several times before (though I've never done it). I think it can help fight the last two groups I mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Some guidelines I would use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Only do it in cases of <em>obvious</em> off-topic and low quality junk.</strong> There are different opinions on what is on-topic. Maybe the person answering thinks the question is valid. I would leave answers to boderline questions alone. Maybe take the approach of not voting at all, but I wouldn't downvote these answers.</li>\n<li><strong>Only do it for high rep users.</strong> I've noticed most answers to obvious off-topic questions come from low to mid rep users. These users may still be learning our site guidelines. There's no sense in possibly alienating them when they are only trying to be helpful. For low rep users, I would say leaving them a comment (or leaving a comment on the question itself) is the better approach. If after repeated comments, they continue answering junk, then downvoting is appropriate. High rep users, on the other hand, should really know better. I think downvoting in these cases is fine. The question is, where do we draw the line between low rep and high rep? I think anyone under 200 rep definitely gets a pass, and anyone over 1000 rep should definitely know better.</li>\n<li><strong>Only do it for new answers.</strong> During the early days of this site we allowed certain types of questions that we no longer allow. We've been working on removing these old off-topic questions from the site, but I'm sure there are some we haven't gotten to yet. If a question was answered in 2009 or 2010, when it was on-topic, I don't think it's fair to downvote someone who answered the question in good faith. In this case, it's better to vote to close the question, and flag it, if appropriate.</li>\n<li><strong>Leave a comment, if you feel inclined to do so.</strong> Voting is anonymous, so leaving a comment is <strong>not</strong> required. That said, leaving comments can be useful in helping people understand site rules. Especially in cases where the answer isn't bad and may cause some confusion.</li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastEditorUserId": 2692, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2012-03-09T00:54:49.000", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-09T00:54:49.000"}

If you've been on any of the <code>.moderated</code> newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.</p>\n\n<p>SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. <em>Anyone</em> can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question <em>back into review/improve mode</em>. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... <em>happen</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do we close a question?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on <em>problems you face</em> or things you are trying to understand. The <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#dontask\">don't ask</a> section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.</li>\n<li>Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.</li>\n<li>Some questions belong elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, <em>broadly speaking</em> true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is closing like deletion?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put \"into improve mode\" if you like, and are still visible for <em>anyone</em> to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the requirements for closing a question?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you have 500 reputation on the site currently, or 3000 reputation on a graduated site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option \"this question does not belong here\". That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why can anyone vote to close/reopen</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is <em>your site</em>. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are moderators different?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ok, so how does it work?</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png\" alt=\"Example close button\"></p>\n\n<p>Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png\" alt=\"Close vote reasons dialog\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png\" alt=\"Other votes\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.</li>\n<li>The \"off topic\" page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.</li>\n<li>The other options are straight out closes.</li>\n<li>Once you pick your option and click \"close\", your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.</li>\n<li>If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.</li>\n<li>Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png\" alt=\"Close banner\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>How does vote to re-open work?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A closed question has a \"reopen\" link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.</p>\n\n<p>Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png\" alt=\"Re-open link\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>What happens if I make a mistake?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Actually there are two tools for this. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/review\">Review</a>. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes.

In doing so, I realized that I was acting based on incorrect assumptions. It turns out that it only takes 300 rep to create tags on graduated SE sites. The only exceptions that I found were Stack Overflow (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/faq#reputation\">requires 1500 rep</a>) and MSO (<a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/faq#reputation\">requires 500 rep</a>). (I thought it was 1500 for all graduated sites.)</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, my original idea of requesting that the rep required to create tags be increased on all beta sites isn't going to fly (I was going to propose 500 rep). The privileges on beta sites need to be earned at lower reputation levels than on graduated sites, for obvious reasons.</p>\n\n<p>So, the best we can hope for is that SE will agree to make this change just for our site. And even then, the best we're likely to get is that they will match the current level of graduated sites - 300 rep.</p>\n\n<p>It is going to be almost impossible to convince SE that it makes sense to make this change for us. Plus, I don't think it is worth the effort for an increase of only 150 rep. However, I am willing to make the case if the community believes this is of benefit. </p>\n\n<p>If you believe this is a worthwhile exercise, upvote Karlson's question. Sharing your thoughts, both in favor and against this proposal, in answers and/or comments would also be very helpful.

However, there is nothing we can do about that. The 150 rep needed to create tags is a network-wide rule applied by Stack Exchange to all beta sites. Only SE can change this, and if they do change it, it will likely be a network-wide change.</p>\n\n<p>This is something that would need to be brought up on meta.stackoverflow.com to get any attention.

This is really just a personal preference. We can just as easily keep <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/software-licensing\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'software-licensing'\" rel=\"tag\">software-licensing</a>, but I think <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/software-license\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'software-license'\" rel=\"tag\">software-license</a> is a better choice. </li>\n<li>Make <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/licence\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'licence'\" rel=\"tag\">licence</a> and <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/licensing\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'licensing'\" rel=\"tag\">licensing</a> synonyms of <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/license\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'license'\" rel=\"tag\">license</a>.

Questions tagged <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/license\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'license'\" rel=\"tag\">license</a> can fall into any of the three categories I described above, so I don't think we should make <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/license\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'license'\" rel=\"tag\">license</a> a synonym of any of the more descriptive tags. We'll need to manually go through all the questions and retag them with the appropriate tag (i.e. <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/software-license\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'software-license'\" rel=\"tag\">software-license</a>, <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/business-permit\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'business-permit'\" rel=\"tag\">business-permit</a>, or <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/tagged/royalties\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'royalties'\" rel=\"tag\">royalties</a>).

(SOX applies to public companies, once you've gone public you are no longer a startup)</p>\n\n<p>What is the difference between single-entry and double entry bookkeeping? (nothing unique to a startup)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marketing research in particular:</strong> The particular issue with marketing research is that to be of value it needs to be done properly and does involve a bunch of math and statistics. consider a question as simple as:</p>\n\n<p>I am trying to decide whether I should sell Coke or Pepsi in my new store, how do I do market research to determine what my customers prefer?</p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p>I'm building a website for my new on-line business to sell widgets, how do I conduct market research to select colors and fonts for the website to optimize sales?</p>\n\n<p>These type of questions on how to conduct research, while clearly startup related, do not permit simple yes/no answers. In fact a complete answer to either of these questions would probably run to several pages and include terms like \"double-blind study\", \"confidence intervals\", \"sample size\" etc.</p>\n\n<p>Viewed from the point of view of which marketing research questions permit simple answers, they pretty much boil down to the type  referenced by Zuly in her question.

Migrations should only be used when you are 100% certain that not only does the question not belong on the site where it was asked, but that it <strong>absolutely does</strong> belong on the site you are targeting with the migration. It is not our responsibility to migrate everything that kinda has something to do with another site.</p>\n\n<p>Here are two examples of why we need to use some caution when migrating:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/82941/please-dont-migrate-low-quality-questions-to-other-sites\">Please don't migrate low-quality questions to other sites</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/73382/please-stop-using-programmers-se-as-your-toilet-bowl\">Please stop using Programmers.SE as your toilet bowl</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm going to explain the background on migrations, and then I'll answer your question. You can skip down to Migration Procedure to see how to do it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n\n<p>The migration tool was created to help users who asked <em>good</em> questions on the wrong site. It is not meant to be used to offload bad questions to other sites. The golden rule of question migration is <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/91446/152571\"><strong>don't migrate crap</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>What that means is if it's a well thought out question, but it's off-topic for our site, we can migrate it to the appropriate SE site. If the question is off-topic for us, but it also happens to be a low quality question, then we should close it as off-topic, and leave it here. We need to keep in mind the SE guidelines regarding <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#close\">Not a Real Question and Not Constructive</a> before migrating a question. A poll type of question is a bad question on any SE site. An overly broad question is a bad question on any SE site. Etc.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that we don't have domain expertise in all of the SE sites. Without domain knowledge it's hard to judge whether a question is good or not. On top of that, we're not intimately familiar with the scope of all the SE sites. Not everything that has to do with programmers, for example, is on-topic for Programmers.SE. </p>\n\n<p>Because of this, what some moderators have resorted to is <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/119115/152571\">asking each other</a> whether a question can be migrated, or not. This is why you may have seen some of my comments referring to asking other site mods about a possible question migration. This isn't an optimal solution, but it prevents a lot of frustrations. </p>\n\n<p>You can read more about migrations on the <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/respect-the-community-your-own-and-others/\">Stack Exchange blog</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Migration Procedure</strong></p>\n\n<p>With all of that in mind, here's the procedure to migrate a question.</p>\n\n<p>First, please take a moment to judge the question. If it is a bad question, vote to close as off-topic and let it be. If you feel it is a good question, then flag it for moderator attention. </p>\n\n<p>On beta sites, only moderators can migrate a question. The only exception to this is the site's meta, where any user with close vote privileges can vote to migrate to the site's meta.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To migrate to our meta site:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select off topic as the close reason.</li>\n<li>Select \"belongs on meta.answers.onstartups.com\".</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/iCKc2.jpg\" alt=\"belongs on meta.answers.onstartups.com\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>To migrate to another SE site:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>(optional) Ask the destination site if the question is a good fit for their site. You can either post a question on their meta site, as was done <a href=\"http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/660/a-question-on-programmers-has-been-flagged-for-migration-here-do-you-want-it/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://meta.money.stackexchange.com/questions/353/are-questions-about-starting-an-investment-club-company-on-topic\">here</a>. Or you can pop into their chatroom and ask there, if the site has an active chatroom. <em>Please don't do this every single time you see a marginal question. Reserve this for good questions.</em> If the other site wants the question, move to step 2.</p></li>\n<li><p>Flag the question for moderator attention. State which site it should be migrated to, and <strong>include a link to the discussion where the other site agrees with the migration</strong>. It's important that you include the link, if the discussion took place. Otherwise there is no guarantee that the migration will actually take place. Without any information to go on, the moderator has to decide whether they know the other site well enough to make a decision, and if not, do they want to take the time to ask the other site. </p></li>\n</ol>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-23T22:49:08.350"}

In the case of starting a business, it really is the situation. People get a lot of misinformation from the media and think anyone can make millions with their latest software idea without understanding the necessary work. Their next step is to open their favorite search engine and look a few things up. Once they hit the slightest barrier, their query will be \"startup questions\", or \"startup help\", or anything of that nature but not the description of their problem in proper terms because they don't know it. In the end, they get to this site and hit the \"Ask a question\" button posting their assinine problem without even reading the rules or trying to search the archives.</p>\n\n<p>The other part of the problem is that people think that legal &amp; accounting advice always costs money and is hard to comprehend. Most people don't even try to search for an answer to their problem because asking someone a question is always easier than finding out yourself. That's why we get so many very basic questions that are answered time &amp; time again in one for or another.</p>\n\n<p>As for community quality, part of it is how the site is being promoted. Quora is the Silicon Valley darling. It started there, attracted the local audience, and stayed there. This site started with Dharmesh (who is relatively known in SV, too) but for some reason it never gained as much traction (I wish I knew a bit more about the history here). As a result, Quora is synonymous with \"Q&amp;A\" in the SV and that's where people go when they need an answer. However, it doesn't mean all the questions there are good. Some of them are as stupid as things we get here, such as \"Who are the 2012 summer interns in Silicon Valley?\" or \"Start up help! Need ideas. Who will be my target market for these products?\"</p>\n\n<p>Startups isn't the only site in SE ecosystem that suffers from hit-and-run users who don't even come back to accept an answer. There're plenty of them. The cause of such behavior is in the inherent reason why people come to such sites: they come to <em>resolve their own problem</em> not to help others or not thinking they could receive any additional value from participation. Only the few who poke around and/or come back to check the answers stick around. For everyone else, it become \"K. Thanx. Bye.\"</p>\n\n<p>So what can we do to remedy all of this? The easiest thing is to step up moderation and close &amp; delete all bad questions on sight without waiting for community response. We can also try to request more moderator slots to make sure there's at least one sweep of the site every hour of the day. (I know some will object but there's no way to keep a house clean without forcing everyone to clean up after themselves.) The second part of the solution is to work with SE HQ and figure out whether they want to promote the site among experienced entrepreneurs &amp; investors to bring more quality answers as well as street buzz (one of the reasons for Quora's success was that you could answer a question and get a high-profile expert's answer to it).</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 15284, "LastActivityDate": "2012-04-30T01:12:21.393", "CommentCount": 1}

You will have to have had a sufficient quantity of questions closed to trigger this, however.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ok, so why was my question closed?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Underneath each question, there is a banner which explains why your question was closed, giving a few short reasons. Here, I will expand on these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Exact duplicate - this type of closure is exactly what it sounds. We already have a question covering that material and it would be better if the material is to be revisited for those answers to be edited and improved on, rather than creating a whole set of duplicate answers.</li>\n<li>Not constructive - some questions are just not suited to the format we use here. These include lists, polling or opinion questions that eat up the time of our members, who are here to help people with their problems and learn about startups in a constructive, problem-by-problem manner.</li>\n<li>Not a real question - questions closed as NARQ fit into two categories; the first is that your question simply doesn't make sense or is so poorly worded it's almost a crime people are reading it. The second is that your question, whilst valid, is just too broad to be covered over the internet and really needs to be broken into manageable chunks.</li>\n<li>Too localized - questions closed with this reason refer to a very narrow scenario, or are, for example, only useful to you and in no way would be useful to other people with the same problem.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What about off topic questions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, a question is good, but just doesn't fit here on OnStartups. In this case two things will happen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The question will be migrated to another Stack Exchange site.</li>\n<li>The question will be closed as purely off topic.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/a/831\">Migration is a privilege</a>, not a right. If your question has been migrated, a moderator has gone to the effort to get it moved; however, there is no onus on us to migrate questions anywhere. If your question is poorly formatted, we are unlikely to move it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I get my question re-opened?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Occasionally, questions are closed by mistake. This is a rare occurrence and will usually be rectified pretty quickly when we realise this has happened.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a list of steps you can take to get your question improved and increase your chances of re-opening:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read about what questions are <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#questions\">on topic</a> and <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#dontask\">off topic</a> in the FAQ.</li>\n<li>Decide if your question was really a fit for SE in the first place. Not all questions are. However, you may well be able to re-word it into such a way that it <em>does</em> fit. Do have a ready of point 3:</li>\n<li>Work through each of the articles on the <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/how-to-ask\">how to ask</a> page. Specifically, I would highlight the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Is your question properly formatted?</li>\n<li>Have you checked your spelling and punctuation?</li>\n<li>Have you explained your problem sufficiently?</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Underneath your question there is an edit link:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/T9Z3Y.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of edit link\"></p>\n\n<p>Use this to improve your question. <strong>Take your time</strong> and ensure you put sufficient effort in. </p></li>\n<li><p>When you are sure you have edited the question and framed it in the best possible way, you may do one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Contact us in <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1293/onstartups\">chat</a>. Users capable of re-opening are not always around, but it may help to ask for feedback and get other user's opinions.</li>\n<li><p>A moderator should have commented on your post. You can reply to them using the following format:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@moderator_name Hello, I've edited my question, can \nyou please let me know if it is suitable for re-opening?\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Alternatively, you can flag for moderator attention using the flag link underneath your question and filling out the custom reason box:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lKBoW.png\" alt=\"Flag dialog\"></p></li>\n</ol>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastActivityDate": "2012-05-16T01:24:55.660"}

Don't get me wrong, when I say poor I mean in a Stack Exchange context, the suggested books may be wonderful, but right now the Stack Exchange model and format has no way of vetting such answers. How do we now which answer (or very small set of answers) is the best? Why would anyone down vote someone's favourite book? Questions that ask for lists of stuff can not be evaluated, every answer is equal, and thus are considered not constructive all across the <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/\">Stack Exchange network</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I realize this is a lot of rules, a lot of guidelines, a lot of thinking.

Popularity alone however is not really what we aim for, it's always nice when a useful question is popular, but a <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/01/the-trouble-with-popularity/\">completely different story when it's just popular</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Popularity is a tough thing. I\u2019m tempted to call it a curse, but what we try to do at Stack Exchange is <strong>make sure that questions and answers are popular for the right reasons \u2014 because they are amazing resources for learning from your peers</strong>. If you want to slip a few jokes in there with the learning, that\u2019s fine, but when the question devolves into little more than entertainment, I hope you can understand why our community moderators are obliged to step in and protect the community from, well \u2026 itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every Stack Exchange community can shape those generic guidelines (to a point) depending on the unique characteristics of the community's expertise, but there's little chance that questions that have failed repeatedly on several sites will work on another. You mention that such questions are welcome and well-received on Programmers (where I'm a moderator), but that's not a very accurate statement: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/books\">324 questions tagged [book]</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bbooks%5D%20closed:1\">116 of which are closed</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And if you sort the 208 open ones by votes, you'll see that most of the <a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&amp;q=%5Bbooks%5D%20closed:0\">high voted [book] questions</a> aren't really requests for lists of books / references, <em>or</em> are questions on canonical books on very specific topics. In fact, <a href=\"http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/2003/are-book-recommendations-on-topic\">we consider book recommendation questions that aren't on specialized and specific topics off topic</a>, and close them asap. </p>\n\n<p>Questions that are asking for external resources / references / books, and worst, a list of, are not questions that have much chance of building up to an amazing resource, for quite a few reasons: External resources get outdated, links rot, people tend to just post their favourite without much explanation, and they are extremely easy questions to answer, which explains their popularity. Thus, not constructive.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>If you insist on raising the question of not being able to choose the best answer, the most common solution is to turn the thread into community Wiki as the other sites do.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, Community Wiki is not a <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/\">\"get out of jail, free\" card</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Community wiki isn\u2019t only abused for \u201cfun\u201d or \u201cgetting-to-know-you\u201d stuff, though.

We welcome all contributions which improve the quality of a site and advertise its greatness to the rest of the world. If you allow a certain class of questions, but only under the stipulation that no one can earn reputation from them, you\u2019ve strongly discouraged these sorts of questions. People aren\u2019t going to put in nearly as much effort to ask them.</p>\n  \n  <p>Instead, strive for quality. If you\u2019re unsure a certain question class belongs on the site, don\u2019t tolerate the worst examples \u2014 demand that these questions be awesome.

If those questions are something you are uncomfortable showing to visitors \u2026 they probably don\u2019t belong on your site.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>If</em> the OnStartups community decides that reference requests are valuable for the site, there's no point in marking them Community Wiki. If not, then there's no point in hosting those questions all together, Community Wiki or not. The problem here is not that these questions generate cheap rep for the participants, but that they don't add to the overall quality of the site, and Community Wiki is only meant to lower the editing threshold and not as an excuse for poor questions.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-05-28T18:00:49.500", "CommentCount": 6}

State that you don't want this to turn into a poll, and that <strong>the answer <em>must</em> include the reason why one option is better than the other</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>The key to getting good answers is that you provide details about your two options. If your question is <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/faq#please-avoid\">too open ended</a> you may end up with a poll, and that's not helpful to you, or anyone else on the site.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastActivityDate": "2012-05-30T17:00:49.537"}

The response was very light. We've seen these evaluations on other sites spark discussion in comments and improvements to the questions and answers on the list. That did not happen here on Startups. This is consistent with what I usually notice when visiting the site - there are many instances of a new user asking a question or giving an answer and not returning. The site members here are having trouble coming together as a cohesive community.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue we picked up on was that a good number of those sample questions on review were very difficult to find through Google. They were not necessarily bad questions or answers - such as <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/36129/my-webmaster-created-our-website-and-is-now-charging-me-a-licensing-fee\">this one</a> - but they're not attracting users to your site because they're difficult to find.</p>\n\n<p>To me, the first issue is the more important one. A healthy, engaged community can fix almost any issues with the content of questions or answers. However, when there <em>isn't</em> a community, the site starts hurting. I'm going to extend the length of the evaluation by a few days, since it took me longer than expected to get back to you guys with this feedback. It would be great to see if this new evaluation would boost the involvement some and get conversations going in the community about the future of this site.</p>\n\n<p><hr>\n<strong>Feedback on <em>this</em> evaluation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Q&amp;A quality in this sample set looks better than the last one, but we hesitate to say this means the site is in the clear scope-wise. There is still a lack of community engagement. That looks to us like one of the biggest problems with the site right now - a bunch of users are MIA and inactive, and user retention seems to be slowing down.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the issues from the previous evaluation seem to still apply. This site needs strong leadership to emerge from its users and help out those who have already stepped up. But even beyond that, every little bit of help ...well... helps. Anybody can submit edits, flag inappropriate questions, and so on. The moderators on this site are doing an admirable job keeping it going, but they can always use a hand and any help they get will make this community stronger.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 15676, "LastEditorUserId": 15676, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2012-07-16T20:42:30.833", "LastActivityDate": "2012-07-16T20:42:30.833", "ClosedDate": "2012-07-03T20:19:18.703", "Title": "answers.OnStartups self-evaluation: let's get critical!", "Tags": ["discussion", "status-completed", "quality-evaluation"], "AnswerCount": 10, "CommentCount": 4}

Therefore, we'll want to make sure we are picking good Q&amp;A threads from our site, and not old threads that are no longer good examples of Q&amp;A on the site. We'll have to figure out a way to vet the threads being selected for the blog posts. I'm not sure on the best way to do this, so I'm looking for feedback from you all.</p></li>\n<li><p>Since this is an OnStartups community event, we want to reward someone from the community. So, do we want to set a minimum rep required to participate? I think we should in order to prevent people who have no interest in the community from showing up, entering the contest, and never coming back. If we do set a minimum rep, what should it be? I'm thinking it should be something low, like less than 300 rep.</p></li>\n<li><p>In addition, there are probably other issues I haven't thought of. <strong>I'm looking for suggestions and feedback on this idea.</strong></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have not approached Stack Exchange about this yet. I'd like to get community involvement before I approach them with this idea. If SE sees that the OnStartups community is strongly behind this, odds are they will agree to this. That means you need to comment, answer, and vote on this thread if you want it to happen. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you think of this? Would you be willing to write a blog post for a chance at a conference sponsorship? Any details I'm overlooking?</strong> Please discuss.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*This won't be a problem.

It could be that we as a community did not do a good job answering their questions, or that their questions are badly worded and could use some editing help. I think it's fairly obvious that the example you cite in your question is a case of a bad citizen, and not a reflection of our community's expertise. In fact, according to that user's profile he has voted 0 times! But let's put that aside for the moment. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n\n<p>A lot of folks on Meta Stack Overflow dislike seeing comments regarding accept rates, even if it's done in a friendly manner. On Stack Overflow, accept rate comments are routinely <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/110644/comment-regarding-accept-rate-removed\">flagged and deleted</a>. There is even a feature request to <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/136951/lets-stop-displaying-a-users-accept-rate\">eliminate displaying a user's accept rate</a>. I think the disdain for accept rate comments stems from the fact that some of the comments may have come across as rude, but I can't say for sure.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I think this is one of those areas where we have the freedom to come up with our own guidelines as a community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What should be the OnStartups policy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We should decide as a community how we want to handle these type of comments, but personally, I don't see anything wrong with leaving new users guidance on how accepting an answer works, as long as it is done in a friendly manner. We are encouraged to teach new users how our site works in every other area, so why not with accepting answers?</p>\n\n<p>I can tell you that as of right now the OnStartups community does not flag these type of comments. And if I see them, I do not delete them, assuming the comments aren't rude. (I'm currently following the <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/66782/152571\">advice here</a>, which says that friendly comments are fine.) To me these comments are in the same category as comments explaining what constitutes an answer and why non-answers are deleted, comments explaining why a question is off-topic for our site, or any other comment that aims to instruct a new user on how our somewhat unique rules work.</p>\n\n<p>My recommendation is that it is fine to leave comments on accepting answers as long as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is a friendly comment.</li>\n<li>It focuses on <strong>how</strong> accepting an answer works, and not on the individual's current accept rate.</li>\n<li>[optional] It contains a link to <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work\">How does accepting an answer work?</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Maybe something along the lines of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Welcome to OnStartups! I noticed that you have a low accept rate. You may not be aware of it, but our site gives you ability to choose which was the best answer you received. It's a nice way of saying \"thank you\" to those that helped you. It also serves as an indicator to others that are having a similar problem. You can learn about how accepting an answer works <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work\">here</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>What shouldn't we do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What we don't want to do is badger people about their accept rates, or encourage people to <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/134069/should-i-accept-wrong-answers-to-boost-my-accept-rate\">accept a wrong or non-useful answer</a> just for the sake of getting their accept rate up. The point of accepting an answer is to signal to the rest of the Internet that, that was the most helpful answer. We don't want others to base their business decisions on bad advice. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastActivityDate": "2012-08-06T17:18:25.837", "CommentCount": 1}

Fourth is merely a \"me too\" statement \u2013 adds nothing of value. If the only problem with the code is OP's clumsiness or if it's a dupe, they should be closed as \"Too localized\" or \"Exact duplicate\" respectively. If the former, the question should also be deleted (either by a mod or by 10k+ users). While #7 is helpful, it still doesn't answer the <em>question</em>. It is good practice to let the OP know that things have changed. If they don't respond, downvote and either move on or write a better answer if you know.</p>\n\n<p>Responses #8,9 and 11 are what we'd like to see on this site. They are to the point, precise and informative. If you're referencing an earlier answer (could also be an external link), provide a crucial summary so as to make the answer self sufficient. This is important for two reasons: having the summary helps in the case of link rot (i.e., external links are dead because their site shut down) and to not have to make people click through a whole bunch of links just to get to the answer. They can proceed if they like what they see. It always helps to link to the relevant documentation/authoritative sources (quoting the important information) in your answers. Remember, in all these cases, you should cite the source(s) that you quoted (it is a good practice to make it explicit that you're quoting yourself). Feel free to edit them in an answer (not yours) if the OP hasn't done so, for after all, this is a collaboratively edited site.</p>\n\n<p>Responses #10 and #12 are curt, and perhaps the most contentious of all. These are quite tricky as they do in fact answer the question, but not in a way that is considered a good answer. Moderators and frequent users generally try to encourage these users to expand on them or quote relevant parts. True, it is tempting to just leave a link and walk off as in #12. However, remember that the answers that you're leaving are not just for the person who asked the question, but for practically anyone who visits that page. If you're not willing do that, then it probably is a good idea to not post that link in the first place. #10, while technically the solution to the question, gives no indication or explanation as to <em>why</em> that is the solution. Beyond this, there is nothing much that can be done other than let the votes speak for itself. However, if you flag these as \"Not an answer\", you better be prepared for a loss in flag-weight. The only time it's acceptable to bring these to a moderator's attention is if the link is dead and there's nothing to indicate what might've been there.</p>\n\n<p>Responses #13\u201315 are self explanatory, but please, do not encourage users who post #15 to ask questions here.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 2692, "LastActivityDate": "2012-09-20T14:53:15.273"}

You also tend to post link-only posts as answers when they should be comments. If the only thing in your post is \"here's a link to something that answers your question\", then it's not considered an answer by SE standards.

For example, \"I'm located in jurisdiction X, where it is illegal to do Y. How can I do Y without getting caught?\"</p></li>\n<li><p>There are some questions that are a little more grey. Or where the OP is unsure about something and is looking to answer \"is X legal?\" In these cases we'll have to use our judgement to determine if the question is asked in good faith, or if the intent is to figure out a way to break the law. If the question seems to be in good faith, I would tend to leave it open, and if necessary, edit it so that the tone clearly reflects that.</p></li>\n<li><p>Questions that are of a pure legal nature and don't apply to the general audience of people starting or running a new business should be closed, regardless of whether the activity is legal or illegal.</p></li>\n<li><p>I'm not opposed to mentions of adult entertainment as long as it is done in good taste and is within the scope of this site. Off-topic, too broad, etc. questions will be closed regardless. With respect to the post you mention in your question, I think it's fine.

So it's not necessarily subjective or opinion-based, and I don't know if I feel comfortable closing the question on those grounds.</p>\n\n<p>But on the other hand, <strong>that company isn't likely to be here to answer the question definitively</strong>, so even though it has a correct answer, the answers that are likely to come up <em>are</em> going to be opinion-based--a guess at what the company does.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Because they're asking about a specific company, would this be \"too localized\"?</strong> How many other people will this question be useful to if we leave it open?</p></li>\n<li><p>To further complicate the matter, these questions usually reference an established company. The business model of an established company may not apply to a small startup. Thinking along these lines, <strong>this question could be closed on the grounds of being off-topic</strong> (not about startups).</p></li>\n<li><p>As a follow up to #3, thinking along broader lines, answers to these questions may be misleading. Just because company X does activity Y and has success, doesn't mean that company A would be successful doing Y as well. It doesn't even mean company X has success as a result of doing Y.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It really feels like the user is unwittingly asking the wrong question</strong>. Should we simply vote to close, and help them sort through things to find what their real question is, and tell them to ask that instead?</p></li>\n<li><p>In my opinion, it feels like these are not good questions, but I'm not sure any of the existing close reasons cover it very well. <strong>Would it be meaningful to have another specialized close option for things like this?</strong> Perhaps something like, \"Asking how a specific other company makes money or functions is not a good fit for this site. Please edit your question to focus on the specific problem your startup is trying to solve instead.\"? (I haven't thought that through very well... that's just a stab in the dark.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Should we allow these questions, and if not, what reasoning should be given for closing them?</strong></p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 15024, "LastActivityDate": "2013-10-13T00:43:12.217", "Title": "Should questions asking how other companies' business model works be allowed?", "Tags": ["discussion"], "AnswerCount": 3, "CommentCount": 1}

If the decision to close the site down is final, and there's no room for negotiation (and I'd say it probably is) then this question and this answer are moot. But I don't really care. Since the site is still open for the time being, I'm going to climb up on the soap box and say my piece.</p>\n\n<h2>Presume There Exists a Place for a Startups-Based Stack Exchange</h2>\n\n<p>There is a broader question here that I'm not going to directly answer. That question is, \"Is there room on the Stack Exchange network and within the overall constraints of Stack Exchange for a Q&amp;A site about startups?\" I think that's a discussion worth having, but it's not what I'm trying to get at with this question. So I want to start off by simply making the presumption that there is value in a startups-related Stack Exchange.</p>\n\n<h2>Presume That This Isn't Quite It</h2>\n\n<p>This site has been incredibly helpful to me over the years. But there are some problems with the site as it stands. I think we've all felt and seen it. Definitely, the fact that the SE Admins are in the process of shutting things down should be a strong sign that this is the case. So let's also make the assumption that this site is broken in at least one meaningful way. We could make a list, but that's beyond the scope of this question.</p>\n\n<h2>The <strike>Three</strike> Two Paths Forward</h2>\n\n<p>As I see it, there are three pathways forward, given the assumption that what we're trying to do here <em>could</em> work, but <em>isn't</em>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Continue on as we have in the past.</strong> This is what we've been doing for a while. Months at least, if not years. We're not growing. We've stalled. It's been the easy choice in the past, I assume because no one actually wants to shut things down, but also because nobody was entirely willing to try to make the radical changes that are needed to fix things. Of course, this option is now off the table, because of the looming site shut down.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Reboot the site through Area 51.</strong> This second option is to pull the plug on things here, and push the site back through Area 51 to allow things to be redefined, users to recommit, and then to start from scratch. (I assume we could reseed the site with some of the questions and answers from here.) This is what the SE Admins are currently aiming for.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>\"Refactor\" the current site into the site it should be.</strong> This final pathway would be to put in effort (by lots of people in the community, probably over months) to gradually make changes to the site to try to put it on a course that will get it to the desired destination.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Why I Think Refactoring is Better Than Rebooting</h2>\n\n<p>I'm a strong supporter of going with option #3, to refactor instead of reboot. Here are my reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Rebooting means losing a lot of the current community.</strong> I've seen some people express interest in continuing to support this site, even if it goes back to Area 51. But there is little doubt that we'll lose a lot of people. It's the demotivation factor. People working on startups have little time to dedicate to helping people. If you take their efforts and trash them, many people will leave and find their own ways to help others.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, the <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5022/\">initial 3D modeling proposal</a> on Area 51 had enough support to get to a private beta where it was declared dead, and sent back to start. The second iteration, under the name \"CG Artists\" was slower to gain popularity. It hit a year in the definition phase and was very close to enough users and enough questions to advance, but the year elapsed and it was closed as well. This Round #2 was actually weaker than Round #1. It lost support in the reboot. It's now on <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/59088/\">Round #3</a>. It's three months into it, and it only has 6 followers. It's most certainly not going to make it in the end. Again, more lost support. The people who are interested in these sites lose their motivation to keep pushing it forward when it goes through a reboot.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Rebooting means lost down time.</strong> We get lots of... um... how do I say this gently... less useful questions here. But we also got lots of great questions. There will be time that the proposal sits in Area 51 that we aren't going to be able to help people like we want to. Likely months, not days. They'll find other communities to get their answers instead. So we potentially lose these people forever.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>You can't make the assumption that what you build the second time will be better than the first.</strong> This site, problems and all, is what it is because of the growth and learning process that has happened over years of time. Some of the problems we have are there because we learned that doing it differently causes bigger problems. Going through a reboot, we're likely to make many, if not all of the same mistakes as we did this time. Especially if we've lost some of our most active members from point #1.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>We're in better shape to get to our destination starting from where we're at, than from scratch.</strong> If you haven't read it before, go read what Joel Spolsky, the CEO of Stack Exchange said <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">you should never do: trash something and start over</a>. Sure, we have a long way to go, and I can understand why it might feel nice to start from a clean slate. But despite the problems, we have a lot going for us as well. I think we'd be fools to throw that away without at least first <em>attempting</em> an in-place fix.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "OwnerUserId": 15024, "LastActivityDate": "2013-11-20T19:58:16.467", "CommentCount": 4}

Right now:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>270 out of 393 users around the 150 rep mark are gone</li>\n<li>75 out of 133 users around the 500 rep mark are gone</li>\n<li>5 out of 17 users around the 3k rep mark are gone</li>\n<li>2 out of 6 users around the 10k rep mark are gone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This paints a <em>very</em> troubling picture. The established users we have are leaving in percentages greater than or equal to 1/3 of what we had, and they're not being replenished by new members that find the site and become engaged with the concept of <em>community</em> and more importantly <em>community moderation</em>. You can't put this task on the shoulders of just a few, and that's what it has boiled down to - it's simply not a tenable situation, and it's continuing to deteriorate. </p>\n\n<p>Our decision to put the site back through area 51 was <em>mostly</em> aimed at ensuring that the topic was defined better, <em>and had a substantial more involved community behind it</em>. We could talk about the scope of the site, come up with better custom close reasons and tweak our help center articles but <em>that doesn't work well when we don't have very many users interested in maintaining the site</em>. Additionally, after 3+ years in beta, the site positively <em>can't</em> sustain a democratic moderator election - there just aren't enough active users to do it.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't want to get too oddly-specific regarding this when I wrote the post saying that the site was going to close, because those of you that remained <em>have</em> been doing what you could for the site despite overwhelming evidence that it just wasn't working.</p>\n\n<p>Only now, after the notice has been posted did we begin <em>talking about what to talk about</em>, and there aren't many people at this table. This <em>could</em> be a great site and a great topic, but it's going to need quite a few more people behind it to make it work.</p>\n\n<p>In the absence of the <em>community</em> taking moderation into their hands, the moderators had to make quite a few unilateral decisions. That's not their fault - and it can't continue. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 1343, "LastActivityDate": "2013-11-25T16:47:36.167", "CommentCount": 6}

Second, why haven't we started a discussion about this <em>since</em> the announcement?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For the former case, I never felt like I had the power or the clout on the site to try to push through real change.</strong> It always felt like something that could have and should have been initiated by somebody with more clout, more reputation, or perhaps just more moderator-y. I couldn't be sure if I was the only one who felt like the site had problems, or if everyone else was seeing it too.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, once the announcement was made, the rules suddenly changed. If the death of the side was impending, who cares how much clout or reputation you have. But <strong>on this side of that kind of revelation, it's hard to feel <em>motivated</em> to start the discussion going.</strong> Heck, it's even hard to want to <em>participate</em> in the discussion even if somebody else gets it started. It feels futile. </p>\n\n<p>We need to feel like our efforts could pay off before investing in that path forward. In fact, we've <em>tried</em> to start this discussion, and when we do, it's not long before the Stack Exchange admins/moderators come along to reiterate that, \"no, the site is still going to be shut down.\" (Let's not confuse the SE admins with the moderators for this specific site, who <em>do</em> seem interested in fixing things.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Since the decision, I've been doing what I can to try to fight the battle to allow us some time to try to work things out. For me, that's the battle to win first, before we can start figuring out <em>how</em> to change.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I, for one, am more than willing to try to get this site working. I've found it fun to be a part of this community, and I feel like I've learned a lot from smart people that I have a lot of respect for. I want that to be around for myself and for other people who try to build their own startups. <strong>If we can convince them to keep the site around on life support for a while longer, I'd be more than happy to help in the rebuilding process.</strong></p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 15024, "LastActivityDate": "2013-11-26T22:17:23.553", "CommentCount": 1}
